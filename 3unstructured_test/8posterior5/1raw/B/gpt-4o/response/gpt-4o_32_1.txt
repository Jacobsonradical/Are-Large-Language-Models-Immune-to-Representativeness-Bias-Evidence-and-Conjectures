To determine \( P(H|E) \) for the field of business administration, we'll need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. **\( P(H) \)** - The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.  
   Let's assume a very rough estimate that any student has an equal chance of being in any of the main fields of study. There are many fields, but let's assume there are approximately 10 broad fields (e.g., business, science, engineering, arts, etc.). So, \( P(H) \) might be around 0.1.

2. **\( P(E|H) \)** - The probability of observing the characteristics described in the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.  
   Business administration generally focuses on leadership, management, and strategic thinking. While it involves understanding and dedication, and can attract empathetic individuals, it may not necessarily be strongly associated with curiosity about nature, love for animals, or solving abstract puzzles. Let's assign a low probability here, maybe around 0.2.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)** - The probability of observing the characteristics described in the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration.  
   Since Adam's traits might be more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, the probability \( P(E|\neg H) \) should be fairly high. Let's estimate it at around 0.8.

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.8 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.72 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.74 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.027 \]

Thus:

  "business administration": "0.027"
