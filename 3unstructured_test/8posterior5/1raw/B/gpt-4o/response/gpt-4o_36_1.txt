Let's break down the problem by evaluating the probabilities step-by-step:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration without any other information.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch E.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Assessing P(H)
P(H), the prior probability of Adam being a business administration student, is not provided directly. For simplicity, assume a uniform distribution across all graduate programs. Let's assume there are 10 major fields, so:

\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]

#### 2. Assessing P(E|H)
This is the probability of Adam’s personality traits being observed if he were studying business administration. Business administration typically involves skills such as management, leadership, and an understanding of organizational behavior, which doesn't strongly correlate with Adam’s traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. Thus, we assign a lower probability:

\[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]

#### 3. Assessing P(E|\neg H)
This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality traits if he is in a field other than business administration. Adam’s traits align well with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Assuming that there are more fields fitting his traits better compared to those that don't, we can consider it higher than P(E|H):

\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Bayes' Rule formula for P(H|E) is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) (total probability of observing E) can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1) \cdot (0.1) + (0.3) \cdot (0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.28 \]

Now, plug in the values into Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.1) \cdot (0.1)}{0.28} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0357 \]

So the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch is approximately 0.036, which is a low probability.
