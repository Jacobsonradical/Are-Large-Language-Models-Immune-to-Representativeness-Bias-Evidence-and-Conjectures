Sure, let's break this down step-by-step using Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Here's an estimation of these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** 
   Generally speaking, there are many fields of study, and without specific information, we might assume Adam had a chance of being in any field. Let's assume a uniform distribution across, say, 10 potential graduate fields (a simplification):
   \[ P(H) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** 
   Given that Adam was studying business administration, what is the probability that he fits the personality sketch \( E \)? Business Administration students often have traits such as leadership, strategic thinking, and an interest in management. Adam's profile (nature, animals, puzzles) doesn't strongly align with typical traits of business administration students. So let's assign a lower probability:
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]

3. **Complement likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   Given that Adam was not studying business administration, what is the probability that he fits the personality sketch \( E \)? Adam's personality traits might be more common in fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. Let's say these traits are moderately common among all other fields:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \]

4. **Marginal probability \( P(E) \):**
   This is the total probability of the evidence, accounting for all fields Adam could be studying. Using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.45 \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.47 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Plugging in the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.47} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.47} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0426 \]

So the likelihood that Adam was a business administration student given his personality sketch is approximately \( 0.0426 \).
