  "business administration": "0.05"

Let's walk through the reasoning:

- P(H) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this is relatively low since his personality traits suggest a deeper interest in nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which are generally less associated with business administration. Therefore, P(H) could be around 0.1 (assuming a generous student distribution across various fields).

- P(E|H) is the probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is a business administration student. While business administration students can have empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, the specific interests in nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles are less typical for that field. Therefore, P(E|H) might be around 0.2.

- P(E|\neg H) is the probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is not a business administration student. Given Adam's clear interests in nature and animals, it might be more likely that his characteristics fit other fields (e.g., biology, ecology). Therefore, P(E|\neg H) might be around 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.47} = \frac{0.02}{0.47} \approx 0.0426 \]

Rounding to two decimal places:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.05 \]

Therefore, the calculated probability is approximately 0.05.
