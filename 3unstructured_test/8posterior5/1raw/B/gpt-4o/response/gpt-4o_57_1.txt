Sure, let's break down the calculations step by step:

1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, typically without any other context. Using general information, let's consider this field is quite common among graduate students but not the most likely for someone with Adam's described interests and skills.
   
   Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) for business administration.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Considering the personality sketch, it seems less likely this profile fits a business administration student who typically focuses more on business concepts, leadership, and management than on nature, puzzles, and animals.

   Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration. Since Adam's interests and characteristics align better with fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology, this value would be higher compared to \( P(E|H) \).

   Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

Now, using Bayes' rule, we compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

\[
P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.32 = 0.34
\]

Therefore,

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.34} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.059
\]

Converting to a value between 0 and 1:

{
  "business administration": "0.059"
}
