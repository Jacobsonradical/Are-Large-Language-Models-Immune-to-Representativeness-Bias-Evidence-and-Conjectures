To compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to consider the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was not enrolled in business administration.

We assume the following:

1. Business administration typically attracts students who might have traits such as resourcefulness, leadership skills, and affinity for organizational tasks but doesn't necessarily prioritize a deep curiosity about nature and animals.
2. Adam's traits (E) are quite specific to fields related to biology, environmental science, or similar fields, rather than business administration.

Given these assumptions:

- \( P(H) \): We assume the average likelihood any graduate student might choose business administration. Let's denote this as a moderate prior probability, say 0.2 (20%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits, the likelihood he fits the expected profile of a business administration student is low. He's more inclined towards nature and animals, fields not typically associated with business administration. Let's estimate this as 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's traits given he is not in business administration is higher because his traits are more aligned with fields other than business administration. Let's estimate this as 0.8.

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Calculating \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.05 * 0.2) + (0.8 * 0.8) = 0.01 + 0.64 = 0.65 \]

Now, calculating \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 * 0.2}{0.65} = \frac{0.01}{0.65} \approx 0.0154 \]

Thus, \( P(H|E) \) or the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality traits is approximately 0.0154.
