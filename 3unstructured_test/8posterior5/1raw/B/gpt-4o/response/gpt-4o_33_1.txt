Sure, I will evaluate the probabilities in the context of Adam's personality sketch and his field of study being business administration.

1. **P(H)** - The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
- In general, business administration is a common graduate field of study. However, given Adam's interest in nature, plants, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts, the base rate for business administration might be lower than average. I will estimate P(H) to be relatively low.
- Let’s assume P(H) = 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)** - The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E if Adam is indeed in business administration.
- Business administration students can certainly have diverse interests and skill sets, including empathy and an appreciation for hard work, but the specific combination of Adam's personality traits seems less aligned with typical business studies. I'll give this a moderate-low value.
- Let’s assume P(E|H) = 0.3.

3. **P(E|\neg H)** - The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E if Adam is not in business administration.
- Adam's traits seem more closely aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or other natural sciences. Since he's likely to be enrolled in one of these other fields, P(E|\neg H) should be higher.
- Let’s assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.7.

Using Bayes' Rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

Substitute the given values:

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.63 = 0.66 \]

Now compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.66} = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \approx 0.045 \]

Thus, the probability of Adam being in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately \( 0.045 \).
