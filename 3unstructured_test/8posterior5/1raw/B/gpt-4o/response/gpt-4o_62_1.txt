Sure, let's start by assessing the necessary probabilities step by step for the field of business administration.

1. P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration.
   - Assuming no prior preference, let's say the probability of being enrolled in Business Administration is moderate, say 0.1.

2. P(E|H): The probability of Adam having his personality traits given that he is enrolled in Business Administration.
   - Given the description, Adam's traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts are less aligned with a typical business administration student, who might be more focused on corporate strategies, marketing, and finance. Thus, this might be low, such as 0.2.

3. P(E|\neg H): The probability of Adam having his personality traits given that he is NOT enrolled in Business Administration.
   - His traits could fit better in fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology. Thus, this might be relatively higher, around 0.8.

Given these probabilities:
- P(H) = 0.1
- P(E|H) = 0.2
- P(E|\neg H) = 0.8

Now, we use Bayesâ€™ rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} {P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Calculating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.72 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.74 \]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.027 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.027.
