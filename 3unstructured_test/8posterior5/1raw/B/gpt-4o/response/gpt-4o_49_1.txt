To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' Rule. This can be expressed as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having these personality traits given that he is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, i.e., the total probability of observing the personality traits \(E\).

We need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Considering the wide range of graduate fields available, let's assume the prior probability of Adam being in any specific field like business administration might be low. We'll estimate it as:
   \[ P(H) = 0.05 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   The given personality sketch of Adam suggests strong empathy, a deep love for animals, a curiosity about nature, and a love for puzzles, which are less typical traits for someone focused on business administration. They are more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc. Let's assume the likelihood:
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.01 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   For fields other than business administration that fit Adam's traits better, let's assume the likelihood:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.10 \]

4. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   The evidence is the total probability of observing the personality traits. It can be calculated as:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.01 \times 0.05) + (0.10 \times 0.95) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.0005 + 0.095 \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.0955 \]

Now apply Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.05}{0.0955} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.0005}{0.0955} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.00524 \]

Finally, rounding it to three decimal places:

  "business administration": 0.005
