Sure, let's break down the problem using Bayes' Rule:

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of the personality sketch (E) given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

Let's assess these probabilities step by step, with some assumptions:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
   - Enrollments in business administration are fairly common among graduate students, but not overwhelmingly so. Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.2\).

2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of Adam having the personality traits described if he is enrolled in business administration.
   - Business administration students might not typically exhibit deep love for animals or curiosity about nature, these traits may be less aligned with a business administration focus. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).

3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of Adam having the personality traits described if he is not enrolled in business administration.
   - The personality traits might be more associated with fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology. Since there are many fields other than business administration, let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.8\).

Now, we calculate \(P(E)\) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.64 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.66 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' Rule to compute \(P(H|E)\):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.2)}{0.66} \]
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.66} \]
\[P(H|E) \approx 0.030 \]

So, the probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.030.
