To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to assess the following probabilities:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of business administration.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration.

Let's make some educated estimates:

1. **P(H)**: Let’s assume the variety of majors pursued by graduate students is quite broad, but business administration is a common one. A prior probability might be around 0.1.

   P(H) ≈ 0.1

2. **P(E|H)**: Business administration students tend to be more extroverted and people-oriented given the nature of their studies and future jobs, which might not be the best fit with Adam's description. We might estimate this probability to be relatively low, perhaps around 0.02.

   P(E|H) ≈ 0.02

3. **P(E|¬H)**: Since Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, quiet demeanor, etc.) align better with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, it’s likely these fit better with his personality. We estimate this to be somewhat high, around 0.3.

   P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.3

Now, we can apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02 * 0.1}{(0.02 * 0.1) + (0.3 * 0.9)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.002}{0.002 + 0.27} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.002}{0.272} \]

\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.0074 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0074.

Therefore, the answer is:

{
  "business administration": "0.0074"
