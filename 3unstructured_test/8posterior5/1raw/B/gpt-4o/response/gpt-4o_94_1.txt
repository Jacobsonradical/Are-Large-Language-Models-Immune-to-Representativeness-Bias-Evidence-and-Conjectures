To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to:

1. Establish prior probabilities: \( P(H) \) and \( P(\neg H) \) for Adam's enrollment in business administration.
2. Estimate the likelihoods: \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).
3. Use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Step-by-Step:

#### 1. Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Without any additional information, we'll assume equal prior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in any graduate field, forming an uninformed prior:

\( P(H) = \frac{1}{N} \)

Here, \( N \) represents the total number of plausible graduate fields. If we assume that there are, for example, 10 plausible fields, then:

\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]

#### 2. Prior Probability \( P(\neg H) \)
The complement of Adam being enrolled in business administration:

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \]

#### 3. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
We need to estimate the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) if he were enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's strong interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals, these traits seem less aligned with a typical business administration student's profile. So let's assign a low probability:

\[ P(E|H) = 0.05 \]

#### 4. Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
We need to estimate the likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch if he were not enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's high intelligence and curiosity about nature, he might be more likely to be found in fields like environmental science or biology. So this likelihood should be higher:

\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

### Bayes' Rule:
Using Bayes' Rule, we compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.18 = 0.185 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.185} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.027 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given his personality, is:
