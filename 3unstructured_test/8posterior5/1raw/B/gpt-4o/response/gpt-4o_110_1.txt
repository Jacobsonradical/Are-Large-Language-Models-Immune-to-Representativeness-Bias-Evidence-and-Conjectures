To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch provided, we will use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's assign the probabilities as follows:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The likelihood of observing the personality traits given Adam was enrolled in business administration.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The likelihood of observing the personality traits given Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
4. \( P(E) \) - The overall probability of observing the personality traits (can be determined via the law of total probability).

Given that these probabilities might not be directly available, we can infer them based on general understanding and estimation.

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration could be fairly common, so we might set this to 0.1 for illustrative purposes.
- \( P(E|H) \): The traits described in the sketch do not strongly correlate with a typical business administration student, who might focus more on leadership, management, and financial skills. We can estimate this to be relatively low, say 0.02.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering that Adamâ€™s traits fit better with fields such as biology, environmental studies, or psychology, where interest in nature, puzzles, empathy, and intelligence are valued, we can estimate this to be higher, say 0.2.

The unconditional probability \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.02 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.002 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.182 \]

Now use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.1}{0.182} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.002}{0.182} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.01099 \]

Approximately, \( P(H|E) \approx 0.011 \).
