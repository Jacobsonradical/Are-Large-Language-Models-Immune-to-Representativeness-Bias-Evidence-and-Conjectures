To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to assign probabilities to the following:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.

Then, using Bayes' theorem, we can compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's start by assigning subjective probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Since we have no specific prior information, we might assume it to be a common field of study. For simplicity, let's assign P(H) = 0.10 (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**: Considering Adam's personality, let's judge how well his traits match a typical business administration student. While business administration students might also have empathy and appreciation for dedication, his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles might not be directly related to business subjects. Therefore, let's assign P(E|H) a relatively low value, say 0.20 (20%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having these traits and being enrolled in any other field. Given his specific interests, he might be more likely to be in a field like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Therefore, we can assume that the probability of matching his personality sketch in these other fields is higher. Let's assign P(E|\neg H) = 0.50 (50%).

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.10}{0.20 \cdot 0.10 + 0.50 \cdot 0.90} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.45} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.47} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.043 \]

Therefore:

{
  "business administration": 0.043
}
