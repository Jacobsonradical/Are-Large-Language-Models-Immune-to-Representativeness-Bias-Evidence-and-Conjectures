To judge the probabilities, we need to consider the likelihood that someone with Adam's personality sketch would be enrolled in a business administration program.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration. Since business administration is a relatively popular field, let's assume a value of 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of seeing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration. Although business administration students can appreciate hard work and be intelligent, Adam's specific traits of strong empathy and a deep love for nature and animals might be a bit less common in this field. Let's assume a value of 0.2.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of seeing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a field other than business administration. Considering that his traits might be more common in fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, we'll assume a higher value. Let's assume 0.4.

Now, let's calculate \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}.\]
Note that \(P(E)\) can be expressed as:
\[P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H).\]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36.\]

Then,
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.36} = \frac{0.04}{0.36} \approx 0.111.\]

So:
{
  "business administration": "0.111"
}
