To compute the probability P(H|E) that Adam was enrolled in business administration, we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since P(E) can be computed using the law of total probability, we have:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's first break down the given probabilities:
- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Without specific context, we can assume a prior probability. Let's assume a general population distribution where a certain fraction of graduate students study business administration. For example, let's assume P(H) = 0.1 (10% of graduate students are in business administration).

- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in business administration. Considering the personality sketch, it's less likely for a business administration student to match these traits perfectly. Let's assign this a value of 0.2 (20%).

- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's traits if he is not enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, it might be more likely he's in a different field that matches these traits better, such as biology or environmental sciences. So P(E|¬H) could be higher. Let's assign this a value of 0.8 (80%).

Now we can use these probabilities to calculate the posterior probability P(H|E):

1. Calculate \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74
\]

2. Apply Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.74} \approx 0.027
\]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch is approximately 0.027 (2.7%).
