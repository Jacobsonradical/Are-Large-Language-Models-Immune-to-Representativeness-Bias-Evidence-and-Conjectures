To evaluate the hypothesis \( H \) that Adam was enrolled in the field of business administration, we need to establish the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. 
2. \( P(E|H) \) - the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch) given that he was enrolled in business administration.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in business administration.

Given the personality sketch in \( E \) and the nature of business administration, we can make some inferences:

- Business administration students often have interests in management, leadership, and economic concepts. While Adam's traits of intelligence and understanding of hard work might align with such a field, his deep curiosity about nature, love for animals, and preference for solving puzzles seem less typical for this field.
- Thus, \( P(E|H) \) might not be particularly high since the traits described are not highly characteristic of business administration students.

Now, let's assign reasonable values:

1. Let \( P(H) = 0.2 \). This reflects a relatively moderate probability, considering the vast array of possible graduate fields.
2. Let \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \). This acknowledges that while some traits align, others do not fit the typical business administration profile well.
3. Let \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \). This reflects that Adam's traits might be more common in fields related to nature, animals, or abstract thinking, making \( E \) somewhat less likely if he were not in business administration.

Now compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.08 = 0.12 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.12} = \frac{0.04}{0.12} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.333.
