Let's break down and estimate the probabilities to use Bayes' rule.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   
   Given no other context, we might assume that the probability of a random graduate student being in business administration is moderate but not exceedingly high, as it is a common field. Let's estimate **P(H) = 0.1**.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.

   While business administration students may have a mix of personalities, the traits described in E (e.g., curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) don't strongly align with what is stereotypically expected in business administration. Let's estimate **P(E|H) = 0.2**.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.

   Since business administration is not particularly linked to the traits in E, and considering there are many other fields more closely aligned with these traits (like environmental science, biology, psychology, etc.), the probability might be higher that Adam's personality aligns with another field. Let's estimate **P(E|\neg H) = 0.9**.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Now, let's calculate these step-by-step:

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.9 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.81 = 0.83 \]

Then,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.83} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.83} \approx 0.024 \]

So, \( P(H|E) \approx 0.024 \).

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.024.

Here is the final answer:

{
  "business administration": "0.024"
