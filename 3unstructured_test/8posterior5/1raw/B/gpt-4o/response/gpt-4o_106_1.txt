To solve the problem using Bayesian analysis, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. P(E|H): The probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam given that he was enrolled in business administration.
3. P(E|¬H): The probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam given that he was not enrolled in business administration.

Given that Adam has a strong curiosity about nature and enjoys solving puzzles, combined with his empathy and love for animals, it suggests he may be more likely to be in a field related to science or a caring profession, rather than business administration.

Let's estimate the probabilities:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - Without more specific information about the distribution of graduate students across various fields, we can assume a general prior probability. For simplicity, let's assume a uniform prior across various fields. So, for estimation purposes, let's assign a generic value (e.g., 0.1).

2. P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he was enrolled in business administration.
   - Given Adam's specific interests and attributes, these characteristics might be less typical for a business administration student. Let's estimate this as a low probability, for instance, 0.05.

3. P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he was not enrolled in business administration.
   - Since Adam's traits seem better aligned with other fields (like biology, environmental science, etc.), this probability would be relatively higher. Let's estimate this as 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule, \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, can be calculated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), which can be determined by:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{(0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.185} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.027 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.027.
