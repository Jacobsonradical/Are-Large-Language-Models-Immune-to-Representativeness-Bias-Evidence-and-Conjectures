To estimate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

Given the personality sketch, let's assign some probabilities. Here's the reasoning:

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration is fairly low because it's just one of many possible fields of graduate study. Suppose we assign \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
  
- \( P(E|H) \): Given his personality and interests (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, solving puzzles), it seems less likely that business administration would nurture these traits and interests. Suppose we assign \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): For fields other than business administration, some fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or veterinary studies might fit Adam's personality sketch better. Hence, \( P(E|\neg H) \) is higher. Suppose we assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Now, we use these probabilities to calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.475 = 0.48 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.05}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.48} \approx 0.0104 \]

So,

{
  "business administration": "0.0104"
