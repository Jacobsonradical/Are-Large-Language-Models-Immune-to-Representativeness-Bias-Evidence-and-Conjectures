Sure, let's break down the components and calculate the probability.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Prior Probability, P(H):** 
   - It's generally known that business administration is a common field of study, but given Adam's personality sketch which indicates a curiosity about nature, plants, puzzles, empathy, and love for animals, the likelihood of him being in business administration would be lower. Let's estimate this prior probability as 0.1.

2. **Likelihood, P(E|H):** 
   - Given that Adam is in business administration, the likelihood of his personality sketch (E) isn't very high, since business administration typically doesn't directly align with interests in nature, plants, and animals. A reasonable estimate might be 0.1.

3. **Likelihood under not H, P(E|Â¬H):** 
   - Given that Adam is not in business administration, the likelihood of his personality sketch E aligning with another field such as biology, ecology, environmental science, or any other field related to nature and animals is much higher. Let's estimate this as 0.6.

4. **Posterior Probability using Bayes' Rule, P(H|E):**

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \]

So,

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.1) + (0.6 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.54 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.55 \]

Now,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.55} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.55} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.018 \]

Thus,

{
  "business administration": "0.018"
