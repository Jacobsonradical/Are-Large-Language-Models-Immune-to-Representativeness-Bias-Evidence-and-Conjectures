To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll follow the standard procedure:

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where,
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (Adam was enrolled in business administration).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given we do not have exact probabilities, we'll make educated guesses based on the provided information about Adam and the typical characteristics of students in business administration.

1. \( P(H) \) (prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration):
   - Business administration is a popular field, but given Adam's specific personality (interest in nature, puzzles, empathy, animals), it's less likely he chose this field. So, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood of observing Adam's personality if he was in business administration):
   - While some traits like intelligence and appreciation for hard work might fit, his love for nature and animals doesn't align strongly. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood of observing Adam's personality if he was not in business administration):
   - Given his traits, it's more likely he was in a field more aligned with his interests (e.g., biology, environmental science). Thus, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

Using these, we can find \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.7 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.63 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.65 \]

Now using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.65} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.65} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.0308 \]

Thus, given the evidence \( E \):

{
  "business administration": 0.0308
