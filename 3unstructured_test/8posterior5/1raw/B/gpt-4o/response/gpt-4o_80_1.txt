To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

This can be rewritten in terms of \( P(E|\neg H) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

**Steps to estimate probabilities:**

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   Since we do not have specific information about Adam's likelihood of being a business administration student, we'll assign an arbitrary prior value. Given the vast number of possible fields, we might choose a relatively small value for a prior such as \( 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   A student in business administration may have characteristics such as curiosity about nature and good problem-solving skills. However, traits like a deep love for animals and strong empathy might be less directly associated with business administration fields. Given these factors, let's assign a moderate likelihood, say \( 0.3 \).

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   For the complementary field where Adam is not in business administration, considering that his personality traits might fit better into fields like biology, environmental science, or similar, we'll assume a higher probability for the likelihood of the given personality sketch. Let's assign this value to be \( 0.7 \).

Now we calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Using the values:

- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.63} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0455 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch \( E \) is approximately:

{
  "business administration": "0.0455"
