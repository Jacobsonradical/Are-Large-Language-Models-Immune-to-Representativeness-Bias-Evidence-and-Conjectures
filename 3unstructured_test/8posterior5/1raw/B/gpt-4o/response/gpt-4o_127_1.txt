To estimate \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing the personality traits in E given that Adam is enrolled in business administration), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of observing the personality traits in E given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration), we can make some educated guesses based on typical characteristics of people in various fields of study.

1. **P(H)**: The probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in business administration is relatively moderate since business administration is a common field but not universal. Let's assume this probability to be around 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam is enrolled in business administration, the probability that he has the listed personality traits is somewhat low. While curiosity, empathy, and intelligence can be found across all fields, the specific focus on nature, animals, and solving puzzles is less typical for business administration students. Let's estimate this probability to be around 0.05 (5%).

3. **P(E|Â¬H)**: Given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration, it seems more likely for Adam to possess these traits, possibly aligning with fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology. Given a broader range of fields that could fit better with the personality traits E, we might estimate this probability to be higher, say around 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.05 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \]

Now, substituting these values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.275} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.018 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given the personality sketch E, can be approximated as 0.018 (1.8%).

The answer in the required format is:

  "business administration": "0.018"
