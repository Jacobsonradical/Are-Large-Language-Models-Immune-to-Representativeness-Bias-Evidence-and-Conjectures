To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in a business administration program given his personality sketch using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits (E) given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits (E) given that he was not enrolled in business administration.

Given that we do not have specific empirical data, we have to make some educated estimates based on typical traits of people in various fields. Let's proceed with the estimation:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Suppose the probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration is around 0.1 (10%). This is given the variety of fields available and the popularity of business administration programs.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Business administration students are generally expected to have a different set of typical traits (e.g., leadership, strategic thinking, etc.) than those described for Adam (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles).
   - Let's estimate that the probability of someone with Adam's traits being in business administration is relatively low, say 0.01 (1%).

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - The traits described for Adam are more likely to align with fields like biology, environmental science, or other sciences.
   - Since there are many fields and assuming Adam's traits are more common in non-business fields, let's estimate this at around 0.2 (20%).

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We approximate \( P(E) \) as follows:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.01 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.001 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.181 \]

Now we can compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.01 \cdot 0.1)}{0.181} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.001}{0.181} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0055 \]

So, the estimated posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0055 (or 0.55%).
