To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for the field of business administration using Bayes' rule, we'll need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):** This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration without knowing his personality traits. Assuming equal probability across a wide range of possible graduate fields, let's assign an arbitrary low value, such as 0.05, given the vast number of potential fields.

2. **Likelihood of E given H, \( P(E|H) \):** Given the personality sketch, we assess how likely it is that someone with Adam's traits would be enrolled in business administration.
   - Curiosity about nature and plants, enjoyment of solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental studies, or psychology rather than business administration. 
   - Business administration students might have different typical traits (analytical skills, leadership, interest in management).
   Hence, let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.02 \) as it seems less likely.

3. **Likelihood of E given not H, \( P(E|\neg H) \):** This is the likelihood of Adam exhibiting the described personality traits, given that he is not in business administration.
   - Since his traits align better with fields other than business administration, we can argue this is relatively high. Let's assign it a higher value such as 0.2.

4. **Prior of not H, \( P(\neg H) \):** This is the complement of \( P(H) \), calculated as \( 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).
Let's calculate it step by step.

First, calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.02 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.001 + 0.19 = 0.191 \]

Now, calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02 \times 0.05}{0.191} = \frac{0.001}{0.191} \approx 0.0052 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality traits is approximately 0.0052.

Therefore, the answer is:
