To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Establishing Prior Probability (\(P(H)\))**: This is the initial probability we assign to the hypothesis \(H\) before considering the evidence \(E\).
2. **Establishing Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))**: This is the probability of observing the evidence \(E\) given that hypothesis \(H\) is true.
3. **Establishing Alternative Likelihood (\(P(E|\neg H)\))**: This is the probability of observing the evidence \(E\) given that hypothesis \(H\) is false.
4. **Using Bayes' Rule**: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \(P(E)\) (the probability of evidence) is computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make reasonable assumptions about the probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration. In the absence of additional specific information about Adam’s likelihood to be in this field, we can assume a general prior. Let's assume a general prior of 0.2 (20%) for business administration since it is one of many possible fields he might choose.

2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam would have his described personality if he were studying business administration. Adam’s interest in nature, puzzles, and animals might not be strongly aligned with typical interests of business administration students. Assuming it's less likely, we can set \( P(E|H) \) to 0.1.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam would have such a personality if he were not enrolled in business administration. Given that his traits are more closely associated with fields like natural sciences or related disciplines, we might assume a higher likelihood here, say 0.3.

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' Rule:

- \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \)

First, calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Next, use Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.077 \]

So, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is approximately 0.077.
