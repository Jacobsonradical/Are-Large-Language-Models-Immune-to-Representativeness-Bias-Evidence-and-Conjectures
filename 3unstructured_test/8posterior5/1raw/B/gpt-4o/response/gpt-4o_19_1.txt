To apply Bayes' rule in this case, we need the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.

Without more specific data, we need to make reasoned estimates for these probabilities. Here are some possible values based on Adam's sketch:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Since business administration is a common field in the U.S., we might estimate a moderate prior probability, say \( 0.2 \) (or 20%).

- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration. Since Adam appears to have characteristics that are typical of someone who might be interested in fields other than business administration (e.g., high empathy, deep love for animals, curiosity about nature), we might estimate this to be relatively low, say \( 0.1 \) (or 10%).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration. Since Adam's personality seems more aligned with fields related to nature, animals, and abstract concepts, the likelihood of this personality given that he was in a different field might be relatively higher. Let's estimate this to be \( 0.5 \) (or 50%).

Now, we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.4 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.42 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0476 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0476 (or 4.76%).

Therefore, the answer is:

  "business administration": 0.0476
