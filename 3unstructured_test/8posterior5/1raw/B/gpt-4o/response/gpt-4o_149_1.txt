Let's estimate the probabilities using the given personality sketch of Adam. 

First, we identify the different probabilities:

1. P(H) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. P(E|H) - The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was enrolled in business administration.
3. P(E|¬H) - The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was not enrolled in business administration.

**Estimations:**

- P(H): Business administration is a common field among graduate students, but given Adam’s interests and traits, it seems less likely. Let's estimate P(H) as 0.1 (10%).
  
- P(E|H): Given Adam's personality traits like a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, these traits are not strongly aligned with what we might expect from a student in business administration. Therefore, we can estimate this as relatively low. Let's say 0.2.

- P(E|¬H): Considering Adam’s personality fits more with a field related to nature, puzzles, or animals, the probability of these traits given he is not in business administration seems reasonably high. Let’s estimate this as 0.8.

**Bayesian Calculation:**

Now, we will use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's compute these values:

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.74} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.027.
