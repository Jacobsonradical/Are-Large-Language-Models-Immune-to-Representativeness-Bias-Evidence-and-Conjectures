To answer the question, we need to estimate the probabilities and then apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's estimate the required values:

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration before considering the personality sketch. Since graduate students can be in a wide variety of fields, and assuming no prior bias towards any field, let’s assign a low probability. For simplicity, we might estimate:

\[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Business administration students typically might not have a strong tendency towards nature and animals, but they can have a variety of personality traits. We can assume this probability to be relatively lower. Let’s estimate:

\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration. Given that E includes traits more common for fields like biology or environmental science, this probability might be higher. Let’s estimate:

\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

4. **P(E)**: This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \]

So,

\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.069 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch is approximately 0.069.
