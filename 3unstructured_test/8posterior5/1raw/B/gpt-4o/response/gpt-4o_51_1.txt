Sure, let's evaluate the given probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, without any additional information. Typically, the proportion of students enrolled in business administration among all graduate students might be around 0.2 to 0.3, but we must formulate a reasonable guess. Let's estimate:

   \( P(H) = 0.25 \)

2. \( P(E|H) \): This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration. Business administration students can have diverse personalities, but Adam's specific personality— though not directly aligned with typical business skills—doesn't completely contradict the field either. Let's estimate:

   \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not in business administration. Given the sketch, it seems more likely for someone with Adam's traits to be in a field related to nature or sciences. We'll estimate:

   \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

Now, applying Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

First calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.3 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.025 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.25 \]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.1 \]

So, \( P(H|E) = 0.1 \).

Based on this analysis, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is:

  "business administration": "0.1"
