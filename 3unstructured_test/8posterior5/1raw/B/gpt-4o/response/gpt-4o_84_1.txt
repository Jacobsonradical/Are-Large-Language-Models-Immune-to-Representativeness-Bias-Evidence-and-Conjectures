To calculate \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.

Given we do not have specific numerical values, we'll use typical assumptions for simplicity:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability that any given graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in business administration is around 0.2 (due to the popularity of MBA programs).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Business administration students are not typically characterized with a strong interest in nature and animals, high empathy, or solving puzzles. These traits are less common among business administration students compared to other fields like biology or psychology. So, we can assume a relatively low likelihood, say 0.1.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is NOT in business administration could be higher since his traits align more closely with fields like biology, psychology, or environmental science. We can estimate this likelihood to be around 0.5.

Using these values:
\( P(E) \) can be approximated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

So:
\[
P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42
\]

Now applying Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048
\]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is:

{
  "business administration": "0.048"
}
