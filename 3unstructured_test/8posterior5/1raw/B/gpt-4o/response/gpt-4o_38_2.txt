To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration (denoted as \(H\)) given his personality sketch (\(E\)), we need to set reasonable estimates for the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\). 

### Prior Probability \(P(H)\)

The field of business administration is a common graduate field in the U.S. We might assume a moderate prior probability for a random graduate student being in business administration:

\(P(H) = 0.2\)

### Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)

Given Adam's personality, it seems less likely that his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and quiet, puzzle-solving personality would fit the typical profile of a business administration student (who might be perceived to engage more in social interaction, leadership, and team projects). However, it's not impossible:

\(P(E|H) = 0.1\)

### Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)

For other fields, especially those related to nature, animals, or abstract concepts (like biology, environmental science, or even philosophy), Adam's personality and interests appear more consistent. So, the likelihood of observing \(E\) if Adam is not in business administration might be relatively high:

\(P(E|\neg H) = 0.5\)

### Applying Bayes' Rule

According to Bayes' rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where \(P(E)\) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]

So, plugging in the values we estimated:

\[P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8)\]
\[P(E) = 0.02 + 0.4\]
\[P(E) = 0.42\]

Now we can calculate \(P(H|E)\):

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42}\]
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.42}\]
\[P(H|E) \approx 0.048\]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.048.
