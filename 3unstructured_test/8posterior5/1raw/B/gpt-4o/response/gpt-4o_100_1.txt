To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' rule to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we need to make some reasonable estimates for the probabilities involved. Let's outline our assumptions and reasoning:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration.
4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given the personality sketch, it seems less likely that Adam would be enrolled in business administration, which typically emphasizes people skills, leadership, and business acumen more than a deep love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts.

Assumptions:
- Let's assume that the probability of a student being enrolled in business administration (P(H)) is roughly 0.1 (10%), given that there are many fields of study in graduate school.
- Given Adam's personality sketch, P(E|H) (the likelihood that a business administration student fits Adam's profile) is relatively low. Let's assume this is 0.01 (1%).
- P(E|\neg H): The probability of someone fitting Adam's profile but not being in business administration might be higher given the broader spectrum of fields. Let's assume it is 0.15 (15%).

With these assumptions, we calculate P(E):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.01 \cdot 0.1) + (0.15 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.001 + 0.135 = 0.136 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.1}{0.136} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.001}{0.136} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.00735 \]

In conclusion,
