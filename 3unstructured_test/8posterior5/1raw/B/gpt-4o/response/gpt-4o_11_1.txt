To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - the likelihood of Adam having those personality traits given he was in business administration.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - the likelihood of Adam having those personality traits given he was not in business administration.

Let's make reasonable estimates for these probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \):
   - Business administration is a popular field, but considering Adam's interest in nature, animals, and solving puzzles, it's not a perfect match. Let's estimate the prior probability as low because fields like biology or environmental science might be a better fit based on the provided personality sketch.
   - Estimated \( P(H) \): 0.1

2. \( P(E|H) \):
   - Although business administration students can have warm hearts, empathy, a love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, the strong curiosity about nature and plants aligns less with business administration.
   - Estimated \( P(E|H) \): 0.2

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \):
   - Given Adam's traits, he's more likely to be in a field like biology, environmental science, or something closely related to nature and animals. These traits align well with these fields.
   - Estimated \( P(E|\neg H) \): 0.8

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.027 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality traits is approximately 0.027.
