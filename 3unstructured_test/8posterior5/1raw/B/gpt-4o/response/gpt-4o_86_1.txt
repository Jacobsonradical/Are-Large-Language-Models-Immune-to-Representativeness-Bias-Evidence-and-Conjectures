To answer the question using Bayes' rule, we need to assign the probabilities for the following:

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was NOT enrolled in business administration.

Given the personality sketch E of Adam, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration due to his affinity for nature, animals, empathy, and solving puzzles. These traits are more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration. 

Let's estimate the probabilities:

- **P(H)**: Since business administration is a common field but not particularly aligned with Adam's interests, let's assume a prior probability of 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Given the sketch, it's less likely that such traits would align with business administration. Let’s assume a conditional probability of 0.1.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Considering Adam’s traits align more with other fields such as environmental science or similar, we’ll assign a fairly high probability of 0.9.

Now, we use Bayes' rule to calculate **P(H|E)**:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To determine \(P(E)\), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.9 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.72 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.74 \]

Now we can calculate \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.027 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given the personality sketch, is approximately 0.027 or 2.7%.
