To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayesian statistics. Let's denote the following probabilities:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he's enrolled in business administration.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he's not enrolled in business administration.

**Assumptions:**
1. Without further information, we can assume a uniform prior probability over different possible fields of study, placing each field at an equal likelihood.
2. The characteristics described in Adam's personality sketch do not typically align with the common traits or interests of someone studying business administration.

Let's assign some reasonable values to these probabilities based on our assumptions:

- P(H) (prior probability of being a business administration student): Let's say there are many fields of study (let's assume 10 for simplicity), so P(H) ≈ 1/10 = 0.1.
  
- P(E|H) (likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is studying business administration): Individuals in business administration might not typically exhibit a deep love for nature, animals, or solving puzzles to the extent described. Thus, we estimate this to be low, say 0.1.

- P(E|¬H) (likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is not studying business administration): Given Adam's personality aligns more closely with fields like biology, environmental science, or even philosophy, we assume this to be relatively higher. Let's estimate this as 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where,

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H) \]

Let's calculate P(E):

\[ P(E) = 0.1 * 0.1 + 0.3 * 0.9 = 0.01 + 0.27 = 0.28 \]

Now, we calculate P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 * 0.1}{0.28} = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \approx 0.036 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given his personality sketch, is approximately
