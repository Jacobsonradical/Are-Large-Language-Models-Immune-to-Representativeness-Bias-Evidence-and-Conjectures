To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayesian inference.

### Definitions and Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch would match if he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch would match if he was not enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.

### Step 1: Estimate the Probabilities

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the business administration program. Since no specific data is given, we can assume a moderate level:
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (10%) as a rough estimate. 

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch fitting someone in business administration. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and disposition towards abstract thinking, it seems less likely for a typical business administration student:
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch fitting someone not enrolled in business administration. Given that Adamâ€™s interests align more closely with fields like biology, environmental science, or similar nature-oriented disciplines:
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \) (30%).

### Step 2: Calculate the Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

First, calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.01 + 0.27 = 0.28 \]

Then calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.28} = \frac{0.01}{0.28} \approx 0.036 \]
