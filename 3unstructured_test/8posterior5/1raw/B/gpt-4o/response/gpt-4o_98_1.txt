Sure, let's evaluate each probability step by step.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   Without specific prior knowledge about Adam's likelihood of choosing a particular field, we could assume a relatively even distribution among various fields available to graduate students. Let's assume there are 10 major fields Adam could reasonably choose from. Therefore,
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was studying business administration.
   Business administration may attract individuals with varied personality traits, but it might be less common for someone with Adam's described strong curiosity about nature, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts. Thus, we assign a relatively low probability to P(E|H). For simplicity, let's estimate:
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.2
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not studying business administration.
   Given Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and abstract thinking, it seems more likely he would be enrolled in a field more closely related to these traits (e.g., biology, environmental science). Weâ€™ll assign a higher probability:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.8
   \]

4. **P(H|E)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch E. Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

   Where:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.8 \times 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74
   \]

   Now, substituting back into Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.74} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027
   \]

Therefore, in the required format:

{
  "business administration": "0.027"
}
