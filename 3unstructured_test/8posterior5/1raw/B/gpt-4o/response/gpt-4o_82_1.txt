To estimate the probabilities and apply Bayes' rule, we need to make some subjective assumptions based on the given personality sketch and common knowledge about students in different fields.

1. **P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration (BA).**
   - Let's assume the prior probability of any random graduate student being in Business Administration is fairly evenly distributed among popular fields. For simplicity, let's consider this to be around 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H): The probability of observing the given personality sketch (E) if Adam was enrolled in Business Administration (H).**
   - Business Administration students can be empathetic and intelligent, but a strong curiosity about nature and love for animals is less typical, though not impossible. Let's assume a moderate probability, around 0.3.

3. **P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing the given personality sketch (E) if Adam was not enrolled in Business Administration (\neg H).**
   - Given that Adam has a deep love for nature and animals, strong empathy, and intelligence, it is more likely he might be in a field related to biology, environmental science, psychology, or similar fields. Let's assign this probability as 0.7.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have the exact value for \( P(E) \), we can use the equivalence:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Where \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.63} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.045 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration given the personality sketch is approximately 0.045 or 4.5%.

Here's the answer in the required format:

  "business administration": 0.045
