Let's break down the information:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam has the described personality traits given that he is enrolled in business administration.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that Adam has the described personality traits given that he is not enrolled in business administration.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality traits. This is what we need to find using Bayes' rule.

### Assumptions:
1. **P(H)**: Let's assume that the probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in business administration is around 0.15 (15%), given the popularity of the field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam possesses the described traits if he is enrolled in business administration is likely lower because business administration typically attracts individuals with stronger interests in commerce, leadership, and management rather than a deep love for nature and animals. Let's estimate this likelihood at 0.05 (5%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood that these traits belong to someone in a different field (such as biology, environmental science, or any other nature/abstract concept-related field) is likely higher. Let's estimate this at 0.20 (20%).

### Calculation:
Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence, which is given by:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's calculate each part:

1. \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \)
2. \( P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.0075 + 0.17 = 0.1775 \)

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.1775} = \frac{0.0075}{0.1775} \approx 0.0423 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality traits is approximately 0.0423 (4.23%).
