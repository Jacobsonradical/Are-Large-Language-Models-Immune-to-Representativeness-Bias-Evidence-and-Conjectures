Alright, let's break this down systematically.

1. **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Without any other information, let's assume that there are a wide range of possible fields that Adam could be enrolled in. As an approximation, let's assume an equal distribution across a broad range of options (say 1 out of 20 broad fields, just for estimation purposes).

   Thus, **P(H) = 1/20 = 0.05**.

2. **P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing E (the personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Based on the traits provided (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles, empathy, appreciation for hard work), these traits are not typically characteristic of someone primarily interested in business administration. These traits align more with fields such as biology, environmental science, etc.

   Therefore, we can roughly estimate **P(E|H) to be low, say 0.1**.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** This is the probability of observing E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration. Given the traits described, it seems reasonable to assume that these traits are relatively uncommon in business administration but are more common in several other fields, such as natural sciences, psychology, etc. These traits are more fitting for fields where nature, animals, solving puzzles, and empathy are more relevant.

   Hence, we can estimate **P(E|\neg H) to be higher, say 0.6**.

Using Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.05) + (0.6 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.57 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.575 \]

Then, the posterior probability is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.05}{0.575} = \frac{0.005}{0.575} \approx 0.0087 \]

Thus, in the given format:

{
  "business administration": "0.0087"
}
