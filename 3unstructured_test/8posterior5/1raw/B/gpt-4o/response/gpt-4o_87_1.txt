To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' rule, which is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For this scenario:

- **H**: Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- **E**: The personality sketch of Adam.

We'll start by estimating the probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration as a graduate student. Since this is a generic estimate, we might assume an equal probability across various fields. However, if we account for the fact that business administration is a common graduate field, we might estimate it to be around 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given H (that Adam is in business administration). Given the interest in nature, plants, puzzles, empathy, and animals, which are not typical traits associated with business administration students, this value is likely to be low. Let's estimate it at 0.1 (10%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given not-H (that Adam is not in business administration). Considering Adam's traits, it's more likely he would be in a field such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or a related field. These fields align more closely with his personality sketch. Therefore, we estimate it higher, say at 0.5 (50%).

4. **P(E)**: The total probability of observing E regardless of the field. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.45 = 0.46 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0217 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0217 (or about 2.17%).
