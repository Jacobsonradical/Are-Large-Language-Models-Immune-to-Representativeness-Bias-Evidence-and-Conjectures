To estimate the probabilities, I will make reasonably informed assumptions based on typical characteristics of students in different fields. Note that these are estimations and should be treated as such.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

**Prior Probability, P(H):**
In the field of business administration, students are generally interested in management, finance, and entrepreneurship. Let's assume a moderate likelihood since this is a popular field but not necessarily the most common for someone with Adam's interests.

P(H) ≈ 0.15

**Likelihood, P(E|H):**
For business administration, the typical curriculum may not always align well with specific interests in nature, plants, or a deep love for animals. However, the traits like high intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and appreciation for hard work are quite valued in business.

P(E|H) ≈ 0.3

**Complement Likelihood, P(E|\neg H):**
In fields other than business administration, e.g., natural sciences, environmental studies, or psychology, Adam's characteristics might fit better.

P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.7

### Applying Bayes' Theorem:
Bayes' theorem formula: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.7 \times (1 - 0.15)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.64} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.64} \approx 0.0703 \]

Rounding to a value between 0 and 1:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.07 \]

### Final Answer:
{
  "business administration": "0.07"
}
