First, let's break down the values needed for Bayes' Rule:

P(H) = The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
P(E|H) = The probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam was enrolled in business administration.
P(E|\neg H) = The probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
P(H|E) = The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch.

Given that we don't have specific numerical prior probabilities, we'll assume reasonable values based on common knowledge about the typical interests and personality traits of business administration students versus students in other fields.

### Assigning Probabilities:

1. **P(H)** (Prior Probability):

We'll estimate the prior probability of a random graduate student being in business administration. Given a variety of disciplines, this might be roughly around 0.15 (15%).

2. **P(E|H)** (Likelihood):

Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has a deep love for animals, and values hard work, this does not strongly align with the typical interests associated with business administration, which more often involve a focus on management, finance, marketing, etc. This might be around 0.1 (10%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)** (Likelihood of the Evidence if Not Business Administration):

If Adam were not in business administration, his personality traits might align more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology. Given the broad nature of these traits, this might be around 0.3 (30%).

### Computing P(H|E) Using Bayes' Rule:

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting in the values, we get:
\[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

Now, calculate P(E):
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.015 + 0.255 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.27 \]

Now, calculate P(H|E):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.15)}{0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.056 \]

### Final Answer:

{
  "business administration": "0.056"
}
