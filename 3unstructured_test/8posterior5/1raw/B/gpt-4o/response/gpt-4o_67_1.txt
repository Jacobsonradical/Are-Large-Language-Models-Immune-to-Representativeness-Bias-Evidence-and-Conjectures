To calculate \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration), \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration), and finally to use Bayes' rule to determine \( P(H|E) \) (the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch E), we need to estimate these values.

### Estimations:

1. \( P(H) \) - Prior Probability:
   This value depends on general statistics about graduate school enrollments, which can vary, but we can reasonably assume it's common enough. For simplicity, let's assume:
   \[
   P(H) = 0.10
   \]
   This assumes a 10% prior probability that a given graduate student might be in business administration.

2. \( P(E|H) \) - Likelihood:
   Given Adam's personality traits (warm heart, empathy, love for animals, high curiosity about nature), these traits are not particularly indicative of a typical business administration student, but they are not impossible either. However, they are probably less likely in this field compared with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Let's estimate:
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.20
   \]

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - Likelihood under the complement:
   There's a variety of other fields where Adam's personality sketch might fit better. Fields such as biology, environmental studies, or psychology might align more naturally with his personality traits. Considering this, we might estimate:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.50
   \]

### Bayes' Rule:
Bayes' rule is used to calculate \( P(H|E) \) as follows:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

First, calculate \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) 
\]

\[ 
P(E) = (0.20 \times 0.10) + (0.50 \times 0.90) 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.02 + 0.45 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.47 
\]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.10}{0.47} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.47} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) \approx 0.0426 
\]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch can be approximated as follows:
