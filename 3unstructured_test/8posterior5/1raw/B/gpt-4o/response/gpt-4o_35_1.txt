  "business administration": 0.05

Here's the reasoning:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in business administration (H). This can be considered relatively low since there's no specific evidence in the personality sketch suggesting an inclination towards business administration. Let's assume a value of 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration. While business administration students can have a variety of personalities, the traits mentioned (curiosity about nature, quiet, empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work) don't strongly correlate with business administration. Let's assume a value of 0.2.

3. **P(E|Â¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in business administration. This would be relatively high since his interests and traits might align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Let's assume a value of 0.8.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.027 \]

So, the probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.027, but to provide a clear answer between 0 and 1 with some rounding:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.05 \]
