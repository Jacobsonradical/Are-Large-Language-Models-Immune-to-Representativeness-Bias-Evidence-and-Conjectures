To apply Bayes' rule, we need to first judge and assign probabilities to P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H).

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a business administration program. Graduate students in the U.S. have diverse fields of study. Business administration is popular but not the majority. Let's assume P(H) = 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of E (Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam is enrolled in business administration. People in business administration often have skills and interests in leadership, management, finance, etc., which might not directly align with Adam’s personality sketch (curiosity about nature, quiet, love for puzzles, animals, etc.); thus, P(E|H) might be relatively low. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.02.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of E given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's personality, it seems more likely he might be in a field related to science, especially biology, ecology, etc. Therefore, this probability would be relatively high. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.02 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.002 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.452 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.1}{0.452} = \frac{0.002}{0.452} \approx 0.0044 \]

So, the probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, P(H|E), is approximately 0.0044.
