To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis \( H \) that Adam was enrolled in a business administration field, given the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch).

Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's consider the components:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration before considering his personality sketch.

\[ P(H) \]

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: The probability that Adam would have the described personality traits if he were enrolled in business administration.

\[ P(E|H) \]

3. **Probability of evidence (\( P(E) \))**: The overall probability that Adam has the given personality traits, regardless of his field.

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

4. **Complementary Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**: The probability that Adam would have the described personality traits if he were not enrolled in business administration.

\[ P(E|\neg H) \]

### Estimating the Probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration is approximately 0.1 (10%).

\[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]

- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less aligned with a typical business administration profile. Business administration might involve more people-focused skills and less emphasis on nature and solving puzzles, but let's give it a value of 0.2 for the slight possibility.

\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the same personality sketch, it is much more likely that Adam might be in a field like biology, environmental science, or another research-oriented area. This could be higher, like 0.8.

\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \]

- \( P(\neg H) \): This is simply 1 minus the prior probability \( P(H) \).

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \approx 0.9 \]

Now, \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.72 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.74 \]

Finally, we can use Bayes' Rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.027 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.027.
