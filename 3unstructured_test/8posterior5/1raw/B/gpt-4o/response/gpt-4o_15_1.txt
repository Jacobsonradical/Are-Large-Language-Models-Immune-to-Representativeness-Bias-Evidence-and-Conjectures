To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration (H) given the personality sketch (E), we need to evaluate P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H), and then apply Bayes' rule.

Let's assess the probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Without specific information about the distribution of graduate students among different fields, let's assume a moderate prior. Assuming there are many fields of study and business administration is one of them, we could set a moderate prior. Let's set P(H) = 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in business administration. Business administration students can have diverse interests and qualities, but the given traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, intelligence, love for animals, appreciation for hard work) are not typically aligned with the common skill set or interests primarily associated with business administration. Therefore, we could set P(E|H) to a relatively low value, say P(E|H) = 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in business administration. Let's assume Adam's qualities fit well with some other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science). Therefore, P(E|\neg H) would be relatively higher. Let's set P(E|\neg H) = 0.5.

Now, we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.45} = \frac{0.01}{0.46} \approx 0.0217 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality traits is approximately 0.0217.
