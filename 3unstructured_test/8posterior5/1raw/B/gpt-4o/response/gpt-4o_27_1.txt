To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \), we can use Bayes' rule: 

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given:
- \( H \) = Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( E \) = Personality sketch of Adam.

### Assumptions:
1. \( P(H) \) (Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration):
   - Let's assume a prior probability for the general distribution of fields of study among U.S. graduate students. For simplicity, we might estimate this as 0.1 (10%).

2. \( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration):
   - Business administration students may not typically align very closely with Adam's personality sketch, which mentions a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and a preference for solving puzzles. This personality sketch seems less typical for business administration students. Therefore, let's estimate this likelihood as 0.2 (20%).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration):
   - Considering the same personality traits, these might be more typical for fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. Therefore, let's estimate this likelihood as 0.5 (50%).

4. \( P(E) \) (Overall probability of the personality sketch E):
   - Using the law of total probability: 
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   - Substituting our values:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.45 = 0.47
   \]

### Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.47} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.47} \approx 0.0426
\]

This gives us the posterior probability:

\[
\boxed{\approx 0.0426 \text{ (about 4.26%)}}
\]

So, in the required format:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.0426"
}
```
