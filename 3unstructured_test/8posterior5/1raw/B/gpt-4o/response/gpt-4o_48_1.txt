To process this problem using Bayesian inference, we need to make some assumptions and estimates about the probabilities involved:

- **P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.**
- **P(E|H): The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.**
- **P(E|¬H): The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.**

Let's assign some reasonable estimates for these probabilities:

1. **P(H): Prior probability Adam was enrolled in business administration.**
   - Based on general graduate school statistics and the general appeal of business administration, let's assume P(H) = 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H): Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.**
   - Business administration students might be less likely to strongly exhibit traits like a deep love for animals, nature, and plants compared to other fields. So, let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1 (10%).

3. **P(E|¬H): Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.**
   - Given Adam's interests and traits, which might align better with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, we consider this probability higher. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (20%).

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.19 \]

Now we can find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.1) \cdot (0.1)}{0.19} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.19} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0526 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0526 or 5.26%.

Therefore:
