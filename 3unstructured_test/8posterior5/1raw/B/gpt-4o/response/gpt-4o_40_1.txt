To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration.

Let's make some educated estimations based on the given personality sketch and the field of business administration.

1. **P(H):**
   - The prior probability that Adam could be enrolled in business administration. Given that we do not have specifics on the distribution of majors, and assuming an equal distribution, we might set \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H):**
   - The probability of Adam’s personality sketch given he was enrolled in business administration. Business administration students might not typically be described as having a deep love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts. We'll imagine this probability might be somewhat low compared to fields more aligned with these traits, say \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):**
   - The probability of Adam’s personality sketch given he was not enrolled in business administration. Since there are many other fields more aligned with Adam’s traits (e.g., biology, environmental science), this probability could be higher. We might estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.8 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where:
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
Let's compute \( P(E) \):
\[ 
P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.8 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74 
\]

Now we can compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.74} = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027 
\]

Hence, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.027 or about 2.7%.
