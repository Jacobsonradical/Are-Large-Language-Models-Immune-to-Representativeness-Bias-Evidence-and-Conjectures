To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a business administration program given his personality sketch, we need to determine the prior probability \( P(H) \) that a random graduate student would be enrolled in business administration. We also need the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of the personality traits given that Adam was a business administration student) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of the personality traits given that Adam was not a business administration student). Let's summarize what we are given:

### Prior \( P(H) \)
This is the general probability that a random graduate student is in a business administration program. Although the exact value is not given, let's assume for simplicity that around 10% (0.10) of graduate students might be in such programs, considering the variety of fields and the popularity of business administration.

### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
This is the probability of observing Adam's traits if he were studying business administration. Business administration requires people skills, leadership, and strategic thinking, which may not directly align with Adam's personality traits of being quiet, empathetic, and having a deep love for nature and animals. Therefore, we will assign a low value, such as 0.1 (10%).

### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
This is the probability of observing the traits if he were not a business administration student. Given his traits align well with fields like environmental science, biology, or puzzle-solving disciplines, this value should be higher. Let's estimate it at 0.5 (50%).

### Calculation using Bayes' Rule
Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

#### Where \( P(E) \) is calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.10) + (0.5 \cdot 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.46 \]

#### Then calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.10}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0217 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality traits is approximately 0.0217.

Let's present the final answer in the required format:
