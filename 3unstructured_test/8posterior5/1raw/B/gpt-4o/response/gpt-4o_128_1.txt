Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( P(H) \) = The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \) = The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch E given that he's enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch E given that he's not enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) = The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch E.

Let's make educated estimations based on the information available:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** Given that business administration is a common field of study, we might estimate the prior probability to be somewhat moderate. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Business administration students can be diverse, but the personality traits described (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals) are less directly aligned with typical business administration characteristics. Letâ€™s estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.02 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** If Adam is not in business administration, his characteristics might align more with other fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Therefore, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.02 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.9) = 0.002 + 0.09 = 0.092 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.1}{0.092} = \frac{0.002}{0.092} \approx 0.0217 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0217.
