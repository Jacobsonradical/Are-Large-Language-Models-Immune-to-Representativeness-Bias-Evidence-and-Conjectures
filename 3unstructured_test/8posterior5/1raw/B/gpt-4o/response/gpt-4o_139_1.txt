To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the values for each term.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - Given that many fields are available to graduate students, let's assume a baseline probability of 1 in 10 for any given field (since we don't have specific data, we're assuming uniform distribution across 10 potential fields).
   - So, P(H) = 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - Business administration often focuses on leadership, management, and related skills, which may not directly align with Adam’s personality sketch that emphasizes curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding abstract concepts. While possible, it’s less typical.
   - Let's assume a moderately low probability, say P(E|H) = 0.2.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
   - Since we have no reason to believe that business administration is especially suited or unsuited for someone with Adam's personality, we'd assume it's similar to other fields, but potentially slightly higher for fields related to nature, puzzles, empathy, etc.
   - For this, we might set P(E|\neg H) = 0.25.

4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the personality sketch E.
   - This is a normalization factor to make sure our probabilities sum to 1. We can derive this as a weighted sum of P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H).

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.25 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.245 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.245} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.245} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0816 \]

Therefore:

{
  "business administration": "0.0816"
}
