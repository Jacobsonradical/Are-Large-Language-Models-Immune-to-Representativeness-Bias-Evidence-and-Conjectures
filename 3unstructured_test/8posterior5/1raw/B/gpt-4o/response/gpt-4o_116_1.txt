To apply Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the probabilities as follows:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration.

Finally, we use Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the exact values, we have to make reasoned estimates:

1. **P(H)**: Business administration is a common field for graduate study but might not align with Adam's personality sketch directly. Let's estimate this a bit lower.

   **Estimate**: 0.1

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of having Adam's personality traits if he was in business administration. It’s possible, but a bit less likely given his curiosity about nature and deep love for animals.

   **Estimate**: 0.2

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having Adam's personality traits if he was not in business administration. Given that his personality is more oriented towards nature, puzzles, and animals, it’s likely higher.

   **Estimate**: 0.8

We also need \( P(E) \), the overall likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch regardless of the field. This can be computed by:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 * 0.1) + (0.8 * 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.72 = 0.74 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 * 0.1}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.027 \]

The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.027.

Here's the answer in the required format:

{
  "business administration": "0.027"
