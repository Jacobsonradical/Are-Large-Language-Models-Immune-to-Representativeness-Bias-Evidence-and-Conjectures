Sure, let’s approach this step by step:

1. **Defining the hypotheses and evidence:**
   - \( H \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - \( E \): Adam's personality sketch.
   
2. **Assigning prior probabilities \(P(H)\):**
   - Suppose the prior probability \(P(H)\) that Adam was enrolled in business administration is 0.1 (10%), considering the diversity of possible graduate fields.
   
3. **Assigning likelihoods \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(E|\neg H)\):**
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality given he was enrolled in business administration. Considering business administration students typically engage with social science, teamwork, and management, this doesn't perfectly fit Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals). Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality given he was not enrolled in business administration. Given how many other fields could match his curiosity, empathy, and love for nature (e.g., biology, environmental science), let’s assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).
   
4. **Computing the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\):**
   - Using Bayes' rule:
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
     \]
   - Where:
     \[
     P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
     \]
   - Given:
     \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
     \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)
     \( P(\neg H) = 0.9 \)
     \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \)
   - Calculate \(P(E)\):
     \[
     P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.63 = 0.65
     \]

   - Finally, compute \( P(H|E) \):
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.65} = \frac{0.02}{0.65} \approx 0.0308
     \]
