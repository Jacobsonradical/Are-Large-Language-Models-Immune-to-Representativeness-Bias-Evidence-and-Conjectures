To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. **Initial Hypothesis Probability, P(H):** This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
2. **Likelihood, P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in business administration.
3. **Alternative Likelihood, P(E|¬H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in business administration.
4. **Posterior Probability, P(H|E):** This is the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.

### Estimations:

**P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration among all possible fields could be approximately 1/10, assuming there are 10 equally likely popular fields of study. Hence, P(H) ≈ 0.1.

**P(E|H):** This probability evaluates how consistent Adam's personality sketch is with someone studying business administration. Given Adam's deep love for nature, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts, it seems less likely, say around 0.2.

**P(E|¬H):** This is the likelihood of Adam’s personality matching any other field of study. Given his characteristics, a field like environmental science or biology might be more fitting. Assuming these fields have higher consistency with his traits, let's give a more generic value like 0.9 for P(E|¬H).

### Bayes Rule Calculation:

Bayes' Rule is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Plugging in the estimated values:

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.9 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.81 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.83 \]

Now, we calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.83} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.83} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.024 \]

Thus, the calculated posterior probability that Adam was studying business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.024.
