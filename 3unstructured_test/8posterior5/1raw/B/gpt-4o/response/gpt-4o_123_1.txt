To estimate the probabilities, we'll make some educated guesses based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and the typical characteristics of fields of study.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given the wide array of fields in graduate studies, this might be relatively low. Let's assume P(H) is 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam would have this personality sketch if he were enrolled in business administration. Here, it's important to match the personality traits with common attributes found in business administration students. While business students can still have these traits, it might be less common compared to other fields like environmental science or psychology. Let’s assume this value is 0.2 (20%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given not being enrolled in business administration. Considering there are many other fields that might better match these personality traits (such as biology, environmental science, psychology, etc.), this probability should be higher. Let's assume P(E|\neg H) is 0.4 (40%).

Now, we use Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

First, calculate P(E):

\[
P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.36 = 0.38
\]

Now, calculate P(H|E):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.38} ≈ \frac{0.02}{0.38} ≈ 0.0526
\]

So, P(H|E) is approximately 0.0526.

Given the context provided, here is the formatted answer:

{
  "business administration": 0.0526
