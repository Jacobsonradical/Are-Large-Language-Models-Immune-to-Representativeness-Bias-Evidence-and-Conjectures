To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch (\(P(H|E)\)), we need to first make some rough estimations for the following:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in business administration.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration.
4. \(P(E)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch E irrespective of the field of study.

Then, we apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For ease, let’s assume:
- \(P(H)\) is relatively moderate since business administration is a common field for graduate studies (let’s use 0.1 or 10%).
- \(P(E|H)\): Given that Adam is quiet, empathetic, loves nature, and has a deep love for animals, it seems less likely he would fit stereotypically in business administration compared to fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Let’s estimate this as low, around 0.05.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The personality sketch might fit more closely with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, so this would be higher. Let’s estimate this as 0.3.
- \(P(E)\) can be derived by the law of total probability but for simplicity, we’ll use it directly in the Bayes' formula.

Given these probabilities, we can roughly calculate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

We approximate \(P(E)\) as follows:
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \approx 0.05 + 0.27 = 0.32 \]

Now we apply the Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.32} = \frac{0.005}{0.32} \approx 0.0156 \]

Given our assumptions, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration based on his personality sketch is approximately 0.0156.

Therefore,

{
  "business administration": "0.0156"
