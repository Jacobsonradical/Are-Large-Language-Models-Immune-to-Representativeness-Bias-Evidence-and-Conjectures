To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) and then use them to calculate \( P(H|E) \).

Let's denote:
- \( H \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( \neg H \): Hypothesis that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.
- \( E \): Evidence based on the personality sketch.

First, we need to make educated estimations for these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: This is the probability that a graduate student is studying business administration in general. Let's assume this probability is around 0.1 (10%).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: This is the probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is studying business administration. Given that business administration typically involves more social interaction and may not heavily focus on nature or empathy toward animals, this probability might be low. Let's assume it is around 0.2 (20%).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This is the probability of observing these personality traits given that Adam is not studying business administration. Since qualities like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are more common in fields like biology, environmental sciences, or psychology, this probability might be higher. Let's assume it is around 0.6 (60%).

Now we apply Bayes' rule to find \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be derived from:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \)

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.54 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.56 \]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.036 \]

So the computed probability \(P(H|E)\) that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given the personality traits described, is approximately 0.036 (or 3.6%).

Here's the answer in the required format:

  "business administration": 0.036
