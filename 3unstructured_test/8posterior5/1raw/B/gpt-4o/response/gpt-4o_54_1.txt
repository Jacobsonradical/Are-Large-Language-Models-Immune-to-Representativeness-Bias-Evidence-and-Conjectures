To solve this, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\).

Given the personality sketch, let's make some qualitative assessments:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is studying business administration is relatively moderate. Let's set \(P(H) = 0.2\).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - The traits listed in \(E\) (curiosity about nature, love for animals, introversion, strong empathy, appreciation for hard work) do not typically align with the stereotypical profile of a business administration student. Hence, \(P(E|H)\) could be considered low. Let's set \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - For non-business administration fields, the traits in \(E\) might be more common, especially in fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc. Therefore, \(P(E|\neg H)\) would be higher. Let's set \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.5\).

Now calculate \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.4 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.42 \]

Finally, use Bayes' Rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0476 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.0476.
