To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch (E), we can use Bayes' rule: 

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

where: 
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was not enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of observing Adam’s personality traits.

Let's make some reasonable estimates:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: 
   Considering the various potential fields Adam could be in (part of numerous fields such as sciences, arts, engineering, etc.), we might assume a low to moderate prior probability for business administration. Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.15\).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   Personality traits specified in E are not particularly indicative of a typical business administration student, who might more commonly exhibit traits like leadership, strategic thinking, and extroversion. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.20\).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   Since E suggests traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and solving puzzles, these traits might be more common in fields like biology, ecology, or environmental sciences. Therefore, these traits might be more likely to be observed if Adam was **not** in business administration. Let’s assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.50\).

4. **Total Probability \(P(E)\)**:
   This can be computed as: 
   \[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]
   \[P(E) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.50 \cdot 0.85)\]
   \[P(E) = 0.03 + 0.425 = 0.455\]

Using these estimates, we can compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.455} \approx 0.066
\]

Thus, the resulting probability is:
