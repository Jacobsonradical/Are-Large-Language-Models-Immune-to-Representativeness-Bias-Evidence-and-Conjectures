To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration (denoted as P(H|E)), we need to consider the following probabilities based on the given information:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration.

Given the Bayesian approach:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where P(E) can be expanded using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Now, let's estimate each of these:

1. **P(H):** Business administration is a common field, but considering Adam's characteristics (high intelligence, appreciation for nature, quietness, empathy for animals) it seems less likely. Therefore, let's assume P(H) = 0.1.

2. **P(E|H):** Given Adam's characteristics, students in business administration might be less likely to display a strong empathy for animals, enjoy solving puzzles, and have a deep love for nature. Thus, let's assume P(E|H) = 0.05.

3. **P(E|¬H):** Considering fields other than business administration, especially those suited for someone with Adam's interests (e.g., environmental science, biology), students are more likely to have similar characteristics. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.4.

4. **P(¬H):** The probability that Adam is not enrolled in business administration, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.9.

Now we can calculate P(E):
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.1) + (0.4 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.36 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.365 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.365} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.005}{0.365} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0137 \]

The probability, rounded to two decimal places:

{
  "business administration": "0.01"
