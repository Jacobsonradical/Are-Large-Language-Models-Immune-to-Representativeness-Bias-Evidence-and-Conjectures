To answer this question, let's evaluate the relevant probabilities before applying Bayes' rule.

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Let's assume the prior probability is somewhat arbitrary and generally reflects overall enrollment rates across various fields. We'll assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given that Adam was enrolled in business administration. Given Adam's characteristics such as a deep love for animals, a warm heart, and a genuine curiosity about nature, these traits are less typically associated with business administration. Thus, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration. Given that his characteristics fit better with fields related to nature, animals, or abstract thinking (like biology, environmental science, etc.), we can assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Now substituting the assumed values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.63} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.65} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0308 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0308. This can be denoted as:

  "business administration": 0.0308
