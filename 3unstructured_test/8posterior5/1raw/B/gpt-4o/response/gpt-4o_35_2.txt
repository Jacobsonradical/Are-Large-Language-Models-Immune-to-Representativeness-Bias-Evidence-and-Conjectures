To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to determine the probabilities \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\). Then, we can compute \(P(H|E)\).

- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a business administration program.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \(E\) given that he is enrolled in a business administration program.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \(E\) given that he is not enrolled in a business administration program.

Then, Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the lack of specific numerical data, we will make reasonable subjective estimates:

1. **Estimate \(P(H)\):**
   Business administration is a relatively common field for graduate students. For simplicity, let's assume \(P(H) = 0.1\).

2. **Estimate \(P(E|H)\):**
   Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles) are not typically associated with a business administration student, who might be more focused on leadership, economics, and management skills. Therefore, let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.05\).

3. **Estimate \(P(E|\neg H)\):**
   The background described fits a student more in fields like biology, environmental science, or something similar. Thus, let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.15\).

4. **Calculate \(P(E)\):**
   \(P(E)\) is the total probability of observing \(E\):
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.1) + (0.15 \times 0.9) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.135 = 0.14 \]

5. **Compute \(P(H|E)\):**
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.14} \]
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.14} \]
   \[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in a business administration program given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0357 (or 3.57%).
