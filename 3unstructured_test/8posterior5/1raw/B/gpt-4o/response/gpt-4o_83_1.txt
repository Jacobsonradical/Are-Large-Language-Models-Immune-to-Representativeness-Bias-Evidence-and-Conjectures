To solve this problem, we first need to understand and denote the probabilities involved:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of Adam's personality sketch \(E\) given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of Adam's personality sketch \(E\) given that he was not enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(H|E)\): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch \(E\).

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Assume the prior probability \(P(H)\) of Adam being enrolled in business administration is determined by the general weighting of how likely a graduate student would choose that field. For simplicity, let's estimate this at \(0.1\) or 10%, considering many fields graduate students can choose from.

2. **Conditional Probability \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - Given Adam's personality sketch \((E)\), let's assess the likelihood of this profile fitting someone in business administration. Business administration may not strongly align with the noted traits (curiosity about nature, quiet demeanor, love for animals, solving puzzles). Let's estimate \(P(E|H)\) as relatively low, say \(0.05\) or 5%.

3. **Complementary Conditional Probability \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - Now consider the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he were not in business administration. Given that nature and animals relate more to fields like biology, environmental science, or related fields, \(P(E|\neg H)\) should be higher. Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H)\) as \(0.6\) or 60%.

### Bayes' Rule Calculation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where,

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(\neg H) \] is simply \(1 - P(H) = 0.9\).

Thus,

\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.1) + (0.6 \times 0.9) = 0.005 + 0.54 = 0.545 \]

Then,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{0.545} = \frac{0.005}{0.545} \approx 0.0092 \]
