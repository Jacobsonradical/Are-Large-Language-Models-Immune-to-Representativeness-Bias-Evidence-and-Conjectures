To evaluate P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we're going to follow these steps:
1. Estimate P(H): the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
2. Estimate P(E|H): the likelihood of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
3. Estimate P(E|¬H): the likelihood of observing E given that Adam is not enrolled in business administration.

Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Assumptions:
- For simplicity, let's assume there is an equal probability of Adam being enrolled in any graduate program, so let's assume P(H) = 0.1 (since there could be many fields, let's start with this rough assumption).
- Given the personality sketch (E), we'll estimate P(E|H) as the probability of those traits given that he's in business administration. Given that those traits don’t strongly align with typical attributes for business administration students, we might estimate this to be low, around 0.2.
- P(E|¬H) is the probability of those traits given that he is not in business administration. Since the traits fit more comfortably within a field like biology or environmental studies, P(E|¬H) could be higher. Let’s estimate it around 0.8.

Plugging into Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.72} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \]

\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.027 \]

Now, formatting the answer as requested:

  "business administration": "0.027"
