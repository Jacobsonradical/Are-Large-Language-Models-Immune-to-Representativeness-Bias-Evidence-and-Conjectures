To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in "Business Administration," we first need to estimate the values for \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) and then apply Bayes' Rule:

### Definitions
- \(P(H)\): Probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
- \(P(E|H)\): Probability that Adam has the characteristics described in E given that he was enrolled in Business Administration.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): Probability that Adam has the characteristics described in E given that he was **not** enrolled in Business Administration.
- \(P(E)\): Total probability that Adam has the characteristics described in E.

### Assumptions and Estimates
1. **\(P(H)\)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration. Given the large variety of graduate fields, let's assume a somewhat average baseline probability for any randomly chosen field among many options, say 0.1 (assuming there are about 10 major fields).

2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: This is the likelihood of Adam’s characteristics if he was enrolled in Business Administration. It's quite unlikely that someone with Adam's characteristics (strong empathy, love for nature and animals, curiosity about nature, understanding of abstract concepts) is in Business Administration. So, we might estimate this value as relatively low, say 0.1.

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This is the probability of Adam having his characteristics if he was enrolled in **any other field**. Since Adam's characteristics seem to align more with fields like Biology, Environmental Science, or Psychology, it’s more likely he has his described characteristics if he’s enrolled in a field other than Business Administration. Let's estimate this value higher, say 0.9.

Using these estimates:
- \(P(H) = 0.1\)
- \(P(E|H) = 0.1\)
- \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.9\)

### Bayes' Rule Calculation

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

So, to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.9 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.81} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.82} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0122 \]

### Conclusion

{
  "business administration": "0.0122"
