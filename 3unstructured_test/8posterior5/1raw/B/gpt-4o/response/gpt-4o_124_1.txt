To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch \(E\) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following probabilities:
1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration (before considering his personality sketch).
2. \(P(E|H)\): The conditional probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was indeed enrolled in business administration.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The conditional probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify the computation, we can use the following formulations:
1. \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

Assume the following values based on typical assumptions and logical deductions:
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability someone in the U.S. was enrolled in business administration is relatively moderate. Let’s assume it to be \(0.1\).
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of someone with Adam’s characteristics choosing business administration is lower, as his interests and traits align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration. Assume it to be \(0.05\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of someone with Adam's characteristics choosing a non-business field is higher. Assume it to be \(0.95\).

Using these values:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.95 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.005 + 0.855 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.86 \]

Now use Bayes' rule to find \(P(H|E)\):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.86} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.86} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0058 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0058.

So, the final output will be:
```json
{
  "business administration": "0.0058"
}
