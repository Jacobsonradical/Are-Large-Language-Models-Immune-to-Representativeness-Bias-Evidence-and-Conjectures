Let's denote:

- \( H \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( E \) as the given personality sketch of Adam.

We need to evaluate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in business administration.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not enrolled in business administration.

We then compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we assume \( P(E) \) is constant and focus on the relative likelihoods.

### Estimate for \( P(H) \):

- For a graduate student, the probability of being enrolled in business administration (MBA or similar) can be assumed to be moderately common among all possible fields.
- Let's reasonably assume: \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

### Estimate for \( P(E|H) \):

- Given that the personality sketch includes curiosity about nature, love of animals, and a strong understanding of dedication, these traits may not typically align with a business administration profile, which often focuses on corporate dynamics, finance, and management.
- Let's reasonably assume: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).

### Estimate for \( P(E|\neg H) \):

- Given that graduate students in fields like environmental sciences, biology, psychology, etc., might exhibit these traits, the likelihood of Adam having this sketch if he is not in business administration is higher.
- Let's reasonably assume: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.45} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.46} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0217 \]
