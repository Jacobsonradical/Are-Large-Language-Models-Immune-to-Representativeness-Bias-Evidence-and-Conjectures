To apply Bayes' rule to compute \(P(H|E)\), we need to consider the prior probability of the hypothesis \(P(H)\), the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis \(P(E|H)\), and the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \(P(E|\neg H)\).

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.

Assumptions:

- Let's assume a moderate prior probability \(P(H)\) around \(0.1\), assuming a variety of fields of study for a graduate student.
- The personality traits listed in \(E\) (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, etc.) seem less likely to be associated with business administration. So, let's assume \(P(E|H)\) is relatively low, say around \(0.05\).
- Given the personality sketch, these traits seem more likely to be found in fields related to biology, ecology, or social sciences rather than business administration. So, we can assume a higher likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\), say around \(0.3\).

Bayes' Rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}\]

Calculations:
- \(P(H) = 0.1\)
- \(P(E|H) = 0.05\)
- \(P(\neg H) = 0.9\) (since \(P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H)\))
- \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\)

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9}\]

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.27}\]

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.275}\]

\[P(H|E) \approx 0.018\]

So, the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch \(E\) is approximately 0.018.
