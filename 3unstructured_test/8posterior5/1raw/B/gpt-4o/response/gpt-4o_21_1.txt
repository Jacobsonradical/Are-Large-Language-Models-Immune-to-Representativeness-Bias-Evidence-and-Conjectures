To approach this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration without any additional information. Since this is not specified, we might assume a generic prior based on average distribution of graduate fields. Let's assume that \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): This is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in business administration. Considering the personality traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, interest in puzzles), these don't strongly align with typical attributes or interests directly related to business administration. This would likely be low. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \).

3. **Probability of \( E \) given not \( H \)** \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is not enrolled in business administration. Considering that Adamâ€™s personality traits might be more common in fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, this probability could be higher. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.275} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.018 \]
