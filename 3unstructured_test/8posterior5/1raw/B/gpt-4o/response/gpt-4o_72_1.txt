To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given his personality sketch, we'll apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.

Since the exact probabilities are not given, we will need to make reasonable qualitative assumptions based on the provided information.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Let's assume a low to moderate prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration as this field is popular but not overwhelmingly dominant across all disciplines. So, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Given Adam's personality sketch (interest in nature, plants, solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and understanding of hard work), it does not strongly correlate with the typical personality and interests of business administration students. Thus, let's assign a moderate to low probability here. So, \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   For fields other than business administration (like biology, environmental science, or any science-related fields), Adam's characteristics seem more aligned. Thus, it's reasonable to assume a relatively higher probability here. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

4. **Overall Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   This can be computed using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.6 \times 0.8) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.48 = 0.5 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.5} = 0.04 \]

Hence, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given his personality sketch, is:
