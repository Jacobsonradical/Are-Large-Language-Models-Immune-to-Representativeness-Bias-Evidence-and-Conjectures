To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration based on the given personality sketch, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. P(E|H): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
3. P(E|¬H): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in business administration.

Let's consider these probabilities:

1. P(H) - The probability that any given graduate student is in business administration. This probability can vary, but let's assume that the proportion of students in business administration is about 10%. Therefore, P(H) ≈ 0.10.

2. P(E|H) - The likelihood of having the personality traits described in the sketch given that Adam is studying business administration. Since the traits described include genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and preference for abstract concepts, which may be less common in a business administration field, we can assume this probability is relatively low, maybe around 0.05.

3. P(E|¬H) - The likelihood of having the personality traits described in the sketch given that Adam is studying a field other than business administration. The traits such as empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and solving puzzles might fit more closely with fields like biology, psychology, or environmental studies. Let's assume this likelihood to be comparatively higher, perhaps around 0.25.

Using Bayes' rule to calculate P(H|E):

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence, calculated as:

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

So, let's calculate \(P(E)\):

\[ 
P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.10 + 0.25 \cdot (1 - 0.10) 
= 0.05 \cdot 0.10 + 0.25 \cdot 0.90 
= 0.005 + 0.225 
= 0.23 
\]

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.10}{0.23} 
= \frac{0.005}{0.23} 
≈ 0.0217 
\]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch is approximately 0.0217 or about 2.17%.
