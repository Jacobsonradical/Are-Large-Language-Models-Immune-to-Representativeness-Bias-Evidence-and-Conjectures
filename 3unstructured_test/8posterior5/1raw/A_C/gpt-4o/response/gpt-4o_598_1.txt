To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field of study given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let’s start by making some qualitative assessments of the necessary probabilities based on Adam's characteristics.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1):
1. **P(H1)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a general probability of around 5% for this field, because there are many different fields one can be enrolled in.

2. **P(E|H1)**: The probability of observing E given that H1 is true. Adam's personality aligns well with this field due to his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. We can estimate a high probability for this, say 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H1)**: The probability of observing E given that H1 is not true. Considering that his characteristics could fit other fields but perhaps not as strongly as agricultural sciences, we might use 0.2.

### Computer Science (H2):
1. **P(H2)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Let’s assume a general probability of around 15% because computer science is a highly popular field.

2. **P(E|H2)**: The probability of observing E given that H2 is true. While Adam is intelligent and enjoys solving puzzles, his deep love for nature and animals, as well as empathy, is less aligned with computer science as compared to agricultural and veterinary science. We could estimate it as 0.3.

3. **P(E|¬H2)**: The probability of observing E given that H2 is not true. Again, considering his characteristics might be more suitable elsewhere, we might use 0.2.

#### Bayes’ Theorem Formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \)

Since we only estimate these values qualitatively and not empirically, our calculations will be simple approximations.

### Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. \( P(H1) = 0.05 \)
2. \( P(E|H1) = 0.8 \)
3. \( P(E|¬H1) = 0.2 \)
4. \( P(¬H1) = 1 - P(H1) = 0.95 \)
5. \( P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|¬H1) \cdot P(¬H1) \)
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

6. \( P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.17 \)

### Calculation for Computer Science:
1. \( P(H2) = 0.15 \)
2. \( P(E|H2) = 0.3 \)
3. \( P(E|¬H2) = 0.2 \)
4. \( P(¬H2) = 1 - P(H2) = 0.85 \)
5. \( P(E) = P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|¬H2) \cdot P(¬H2) \)
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.045 + 0.17 = 0.215 \]

6. \( P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.215} \approx 0.21 \)

Final estimation:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.17,
  "computer science": 0.21
}
```

These results show the probabilities based on the initial \textit{hypothetical} assumptions and qualitative judgements. Please note that real estimations would require empirical data to refine these probabilities.
