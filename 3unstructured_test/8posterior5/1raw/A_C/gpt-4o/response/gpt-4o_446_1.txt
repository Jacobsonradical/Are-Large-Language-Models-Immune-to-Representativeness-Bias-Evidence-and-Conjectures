To answer the question, we'll use Bayes' theorem to compute the conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the evidence \( E \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that the evidence matches given Adam is in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability that the evidence matches given Adam is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence, which can be computed by \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

Let's assign reasonable values for these probabilities based on typical scenarios and given information:

**Computer Science:**
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Assuming a broad range of graduate fields and considering the popularity of computer science, let's assign it a prior probability value of 0.2.
2. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|H) \)**: Since Adam's traits such as genuine curiosity, high intelligence, and good understanding of abstract concepts fit well with typical traits of computer science students, we can assume a high probability of the evidence fitting this field. Let's assign a value of 0.7.
3. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that these traits are observed in someone not in computer science but in any other field is somewhat lower. Let's assign it a value of 0.4.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is generally a less commonly chosen field compared to fields like computer science. So we will assign it a value of 0.05.
2. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's deep love for animals and curiosity about nature strongly suggest he would fit well in this field. We will assign a high value of 0.9.
3. **Conditional Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For those not in this field, Adam's traits may still somewhat align, but let's assume the probability is lower compared to those within the field. Let's assign it a value of 0.5.

Now, we calculate the overall probability of the evidence \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{cs})P(H_{cs}) + P(E|H_{ag})P(H_{ag}) + P(E|\neg H_{cs})P(\neg H_{cs}) + P(E|\neg H_{ag})P(\neg H_{ag}) \]

For simplicity, let's ignore the other fields and assume \( P(E) = 0.5 \). This provides a simplifying assumption that we can use for both fields.

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

**Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs})P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.14}{0.5} = 0.28 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ag})P(H_{ag})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.5} = \frac{0.045}{0.5} = 0.09 \]

So, the final values are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.28,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09
}
```
