Let's use Bayes' Rule to compute the probabilities. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam has the given personality sketch if he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam has the given personality sketch if he was not enrolled in that field.

Let's assume the following reasonable estimates based on the information provided:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): The probability that any given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given his strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in plants, there's a high probability that Adam fits this profile if he were in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam were not in this field, there's still a chance he'd have these personality traits, but it's lower. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \).

For Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): The probability that any given graduate student is in computer science. Assume \( P(H) = 0.20 \) (20%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given his high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, there's a reasonable probability Adam fits this profile if he were in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.50 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam were not in this field, the probability of having these personality traits could still apply, but not as strongly. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Let's denote:
- Prior for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(H_{ag}) = 0.05 \)
- Probability of traits given Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(E|H_{ag}) = 0.80 \)
- Probability of traits given not Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(E|\neg H_{ag}) = 0.20 \)

And for Computer Science:
- Prior for Computer Science: \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.20 \)
- Probability of traits given Computer Science: \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.50 \)
- Probability of traits given not Computer Science: \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.30 \)

To find \( P(E) \), we sum over all hypotheses (fields of study) but for simplicity, consider only these two fields (recognizing this is a simplification and the complete model should include additional fields):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{ag}) P(H_{ag}) + P(E|H_{cs}) P(H_{cs}) + P(E| \neg H_{ag} \cap \neg H_{cs}) P(\neg H_{ag} \cap \neg H_{cs}) \]

Approximating \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{ag}) P(H_{ag}) + P(E|H_{cs}) P(H_{cs}) + P(E| \neg H_{ag} \cap \neg H_{cs}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.05) + (0.50 \cdot 0.20) + 0.10 \]
Where 0.10 is an assumed average probability for the given personality sketch over all other fields.

\[ P(E) \approx 0.04 + 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.24 \]

Now, compute \( P(H_{ag}|E) \) and \( P(H_{cs}|E) \):

\[ P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.05}{0.24} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.24} \approx 0.167 \]

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.20}{0.24} \approx \frac{0.10}{0.24} \approx 0.417 \]

So the final probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.167,
  "computer science": 0.417
}

Note: The numbers and probabilities are estimated based on reasonable assumptions and may vary with more precise data.
