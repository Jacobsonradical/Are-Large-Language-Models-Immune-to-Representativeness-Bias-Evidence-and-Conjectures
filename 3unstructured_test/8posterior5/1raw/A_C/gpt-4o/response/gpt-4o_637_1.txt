To apply Bayes' rule and estimate the probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing only two fields, we can ignore the other fields and denote the proportional relationship. The evidence \( P(E) \) will cancel out when comparing two probabilities, so we can omit its calculation in this context. Our aim is to compute the relative probabilities, not absolute ones.

### Computer Science

Let's consider characteristic likelihoods and prior probabilities:
- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Computer Science is a popular graduate field. Let's assume a moderate prior of 0.2.
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: While Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities might fit, the connection to his love for nature and animals seems less likely. Let's assign a value of 0.3.
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Considering other fields that align more with empathy, nature, and animals, the likelihood of these traits outside of Computer Science is high. Assign 0.8.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

Now, let's consider:
- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: This field is less common than Computer Science among graduate students relative to more technical or business fields. Assume a prior of 0.05.
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align very well with this field. Assign a high value, say 0.9.
- **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Dissimilar characteristics are lower compared to specific fields like Computer Science. Assign a lower value, such as 0.4.

Now, we compute the numerators for \( P(H|E) \):

For Computer Science:
\[ \text{Numerator}_{CS} = P(E|H_{CS}) \times P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ \text{Numerator}_{AVS} = P(E|H_{AVS}) \times P(H_{AVS}) = 0.9 \times 0.05 = 0.045 \]

These results show that while the absolute probabilities are low, they can still be normalized against each other.

Finally, we normalize these probabilities by computing their proportional relationship:

Total (for normalization):
\[ Total = \text{Numerator}_{CS} + \text{Numerator}_{AVS} = 0.06 + 0.045 = 0.105 \]

Normalized probabilities:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.105} \approx 0.571 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.105} \approx 0.429 \]

Thus, the probabilities are relatively:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.571,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.429
}
```

This demonstrates that the personality sketch E is more likely associated with Computer Science when excluding other specializations, despite the strong match with Agricultural and Veterinary Science features.
