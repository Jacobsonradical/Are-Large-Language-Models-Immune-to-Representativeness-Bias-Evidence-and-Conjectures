To determine the probabilities, we need to apply Bayes' Rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Since computing \( P(E) \) exactly requires summing over all possible fields, we will use relative comparisons. We're interested in the relative probabilities, so we will focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

First, we make reasonable estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

### Computer Science
- **\( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Students enrolling in computer science is relatively common but not dominant among all graduate fields. Let’s assume a moderate prior of \( 0.2 \).
- **\( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Adam's characteristics fit some aspects of computer science students (high intelligence, good at abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles), but he also has strong features that don't necessarily align well with typical CS students (love for animals, empathy, nature curiosity). Let’s estimate \( 0.5 \).
- **\( P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: For students not in CS, Adam's characteristics are still quite common in other fields. Let’s estimate \( 0.7 \).

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = 0.1 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\( P(H_{\text{Ag}}) \)**: This field is less common compared to mainstream fields like computer science. Let’s assume a lower prior of \( 0.05 \).
- **\( P(E|H_{\text{Ag}}) \)**: Adam's characteristics align very well with agricultural and veterinary science (curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, appreciation for hard work). Let’s estimate \( 0.9 \).
- **\( P(\neg H_{\text{Ag}}) \)**: The overall arrangement of Adam's characteristics is less likely balanced outside of this field considering the specificity. Let’s estimate \( 0.4 \).

\[ P(H_{\text{Ag}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{Ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Ag}})}{P(E)} = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{Ag}}|E) = 0.045 \]

Now, normalizing for simpler comparison (although the exact P(E) is unknown but constant for each):

```
{
  "computer science": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.045"
}
```

This suggests Adam has a relatively modest probability of being in computer science based purely on the personality sketch, and a somewhat lower probability for agricultural and veterinary science. However, given the strong alignment of his interests, the field-specific contrast may evolve concentrating more on discipline-related precursors.
