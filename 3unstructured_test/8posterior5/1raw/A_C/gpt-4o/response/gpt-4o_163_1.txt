To apply Bayes' rule for calculating the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we need to break down the probability into the components \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field. Let's assume this is a moderately common field among graduate students, so \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he was in this field. Given his interest in nature, plants, and animals, this matches well, so \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's traits given that he was not in this field. Considering the general population of graduate students, his traits are somewhat less common, so \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41 \]

### Computer Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in this field. This is a highly common field, so \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's traits given that he was in this field. His skills in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align well, but he may have less focus on nature and animals compared to some other students in this field, so \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Likelihood of Adam's traits given that he was not in this field. Considering the diverse grad student traits in other fields, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.21} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.33} \approx 0.36 \]

So, the calculated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.41,
  "computer science": 0.36
}
```
