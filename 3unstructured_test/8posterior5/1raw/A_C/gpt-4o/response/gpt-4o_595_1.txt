Let's go through the steps to estimate the conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of computer science and agricultural and veterinary science.

Given:
1. \( E \): Personality sketch of Adam.
2. \( H \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.

We need to estimate:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch E given H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch E given not H.

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Assuming a general distribution of fields among graduate students, let's assign a prior probability of around 10% for Adam being in computer science.
   
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Computer science students can be curious, intelligent, and good at solving puzzles. However, the empathy and love for nature described in the personality sketch are less stereotypical for computer science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be around 0.4.
   
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch E given Adam is in any field other than computer science. Given the broadness of graduate fields and the description fitting better into other fields, let's estimate this around 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{0.4 \times 0.1 + 0.6 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.54} = \frac{0.04}{0.58} \approx 0.069 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Agricultural and veterinary sciences are less common than some fields but still significant. Let's assign a prior probability of around 10% for simplicity.
   
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch, especially the love for nature and animals and empathy, fits very well with this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be around 0.8.
   
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This remains the probability of the personality sketch E given Adam is in any other field. Given most fields other than agricultural and veterinary science might not fit the sketch as well, let's keep this at around 0.5 for generality.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.5 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.45} = \frac{0.08}{0.53} \approx 0.151 \]

Thus, the estimated conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.069,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.151
}
```
