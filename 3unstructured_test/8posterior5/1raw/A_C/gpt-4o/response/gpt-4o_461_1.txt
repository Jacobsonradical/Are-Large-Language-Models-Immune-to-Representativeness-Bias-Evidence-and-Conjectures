Let's start by estimating the probabilities for each hypothesis and then use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities.

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

- **P(H)** (prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science):
  Let's assume there's a relatively lower proportion of students in agricultural and veterinary science compared to other more common fields like business, engineering, etc. For simplicity, let's set \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

- **P(E|H)** (probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was indeed in agricultural and veterinary science):
  Given Adam's characteristics such as a love for nature, animals, and hard work, it is very likely he would be in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

- **P(E|¬H)** (probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was not in agricultural and veterinary science):
  Given Adam’s profile, it is possible for him to be in other related fields considering his qualities, but it’s less likely than being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s set \( P(E|¬H) = 0.1 \).

**2. Computer Science:**

- **P(H)** (prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science):
  Computer science is a highly popular field. Let’s conservatively set \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|H)** (probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was in computer science):
  While Adam's intelligence and love for solving puzzles fit well with computer science, other parts of his personality like empathy and love for nature might be less indicative. Let’s set \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

- **P(E|¬H)** (probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was not in computer science):
  Given that computer science is less likely aligned with his love for animals and nature, let's assume \( P(E|¬H) = 0.2 \).

Now, we use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} {P(E)} \]

where 

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \].

Let's calculate each one.

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.095 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.13 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05} {0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035} {0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.269 \]

**For Computer Science:**

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.22 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1} {0.22} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04} {0.22} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.182 \]

Thus, the results in the specified format are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.269,
  "computer science": 0.182
}
```
