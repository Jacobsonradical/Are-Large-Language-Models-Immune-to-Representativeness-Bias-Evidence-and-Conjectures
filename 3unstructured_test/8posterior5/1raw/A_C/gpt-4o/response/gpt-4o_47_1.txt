To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following values:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in the particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality if he is not enrolled in the particular field.

Bayes’ rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is constant across fields and isn't directly given, we can compare the relative likelihoods without it.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the typical distribution of graduate students across various fields, this might be relatively low, say 5%, or \( 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals, the likelihood of his personality aligning with this field is quite high, say 0.9.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing these traits in someone not in this field. Considering Adam’s traits are quite specific to this field, this might be lower, say 0.3.

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in computer science. This field is quite popular, say a higher chance, around 20%, or \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): While Adam’s intelligence and abstract thinking align with computer science, his affinity for nature and animals doesn’t directly fit, reducing the likelihood, say 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the described traits if he's not in computer science is higher, considering his specific traits are less likely to hinder a non-CS enrollment, say 0.4.

### Computation

Using Bayes’ rule without \( P(E) \):

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]

- Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Normalizing to a relative comparison:
\[ P(H|E \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.08} = \frac{0.045}{0.125} \approx 0.36 \]

\[ P(H|E \text{ for computer science}) = \frac{0.08}{0.045 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.125} \approx 0.64 \]

Therefore, conditioned on the personality sketch, the probability of Adam being enrolled in either field is:
