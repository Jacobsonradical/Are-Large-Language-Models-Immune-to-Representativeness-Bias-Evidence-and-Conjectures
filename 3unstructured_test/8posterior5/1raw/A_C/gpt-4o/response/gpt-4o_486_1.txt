To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) (before considering Adam’s personality).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence \( E \), which can be computed using the law of total probability: \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

We will define and use approximate values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

1. **Computer Science**

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability for Adam being enrolled in computer science is relatively common, \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's description, let’s assume there's a smaller likelihood he would fit a typical computer science student profile, focusing more on nature and animals, so \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he is not studying computer science. Since there are many fields where his traits fit well, let’s say \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- \( P(H) \): Assume it's less common than computer science but fits Adam’s profile much better, so \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s personality sketch is highly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science, so \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is still the overall probability of observing Adam’s sketch if not in this field, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

Given these approximations, we can compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule.

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \approx 0.0476 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.45 = 0.52 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.52} \approx 0.1346 \]

So, the results in the required format would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.0476,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1346
}
