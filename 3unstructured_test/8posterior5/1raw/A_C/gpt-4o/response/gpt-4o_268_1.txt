Sure, let's proceed with the calculations by evaluating the necessary probabilities. Here's the breakdown for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in this field. Given his interest in nature, animals, and empathy, this seems plausible but not overwhelmingly likely. Let's assign this a moderate probability of 0.3.
    - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch E given that he is in this field. Since this field aligns well with his interests and empathy for animals, this should be high, say 0.8.
    - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is NOT in this field. Given there are many fields where he might fit, and less specific characteristics for animals and nature, let’s say this probability is lower, around 0.1.

Now applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.07} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.31} \approx 0.774 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
    - **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in this field. Given his intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, this is quite plausible. Let’s assign a probability of 0.4.
    - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch E given that he is in this field. This fits well with puzzles and abstract thinking but less so with nature and animals. Let’s assign this a moderate value of 0.4.
    - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is NOT in this field. This is still fairly likely, let’s assign a value of 0.2.

Now applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.4}{0.4 \cdot 0.4 + 0.2 \cdot 0.6} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.12} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.28} \approx 0.571 \]

So the final probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.774,
  "computer science": 0.571
}
