To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we'll follow these steps using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, and it can be derived from \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

We need to estimate the values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Let's assume that the prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science is relatively high, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Given the personality sketch, Adam's attributes like high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science, but his love for animals and nature might not. Suppose \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   The probability of a graduate student not in computer science having these traits might be slightly lower. Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

#### Calculation for Computer Science:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.1 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.08} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.43
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Let's assume the prior probability for this field is lower than computer science but still significant, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Adam's love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work fit well in this field. Suppose \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   The probability of a graduate student in another field having these traits might be lower than those in agricultural and veterinary science. Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

#### Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.7 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28
\]

Here is the final result:

```
{
  "computer science": 0.43,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28
}
```

Please note that these are estimated values based on the provided personality sketch and some reasonable assumptions about prior probabilities and likelihoods. The actual probabilities might differ based on more exact data and context.
