To determine the probabilities regarding which field Adam might be enrolled in, we'll first assign values to the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given he is not in that field \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then, we'll use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(\text{H}) \)**
   - Given Adam's characteristics and interests in nature, plants, and animals, it's reasonable to assign a relatively higher prior probability to this field.
   - Let's assign \( P(\text{H}) = 0.3 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Adam's personality aligns well with this field due to his love for animals, empathy, and interest in nature.
   - Assign \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Likelihood of Evidence Given Not in Field \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - Considering there are many students in other fields who might share similar traits, but possibly to a lesser extent.
   - Assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**
   - Apply Bayes' Rule: 
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.14} = \frac{0.24}{0.38} \approx 0.63
     \]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(\text{H}) \)**
   - Given the vast number of students in computer science, we can assign a general prior probability.
   - Let's assign \( P(\text{H}) = 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is highly intelligent, which aligns well with computer science.
   - However, the specific interests in nature and animals do not directly match as strongly.
   - Assign \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. **Likelihood of Evidence Given Not in Field \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - Many other fields could have students with similar traits.
   - Assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**
   - Apply Bayes' Rule:
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.4 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.255} = \frac{0.06}{0.315} \approx 0.19
     \]
