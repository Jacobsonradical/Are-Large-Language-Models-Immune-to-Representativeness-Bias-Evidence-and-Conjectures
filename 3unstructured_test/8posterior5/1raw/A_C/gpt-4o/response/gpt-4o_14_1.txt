To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch \( E \). 

Assuming \( \neg H \) covers all fields other than the considered hypothesis:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) is the same for all fields and is moderately probable given that Adam is a graduate student in the U.S. We might assign a value of 0.1 to each field \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Judgements

- \( P(H) \): Since we're assuming each field has the same initial probability, \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality sketch, Adam has a strong affinity for nature, plants, and animals, along with empathy and understanding of hard work. Therefore, it's highly likely he'd pursue a degree in this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) as 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This would be the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in any field other than agricultural and veterinary science. Considering the traits listed, they align less well with other fields on average. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) as 0.2.

#### Calculation

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx 0.3077 \]

### Computer Science

#### Judgements

- \( P(H) \): Again assuming each field has the same initial probability, \( P(\text{computer science}) \) is 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence for understanding abstract concepts. This aligns well with computer science. Let's estimate \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \) as 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in any field other than computer science would be less because his specific traits align partially with scientific reasoning but are more generalized towards nature-driven fields. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \) as 0.3.

#### Calculation

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{computer science}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.34 \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.34} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.34} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx 0.2059 \]
