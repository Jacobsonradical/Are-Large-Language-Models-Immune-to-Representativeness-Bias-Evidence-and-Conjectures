To estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, let's break it down step by step using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam were enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam were not enrolled in that field.

Let's estimate these probabilities for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This field is not one of the most common graduate fields, but given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, we'll assume it's a moderate likelihood.
  - Assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

- **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality sketch highly aligns with this field (curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals).
  - Assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of someone having this personality sketch and not being in this field is lower, but not negligible.
  - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: This is a more common graduate field.
  - Assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)

- **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch aligns less well with computer science, so the probability is lower.
  - Assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam were not in computer science might be higher, given that many students who are not in computer science could also possess these traits.
  - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \)

Now let's calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.6 \times 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.48 = 0.54 \]

Finally, let's use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|E) \):

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.27} \approx 0.333 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.54} \approx 0.111 \]

Here are the probabilities rounded to three decimal places:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.333,
