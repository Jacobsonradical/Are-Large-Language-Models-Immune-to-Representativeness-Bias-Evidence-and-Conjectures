To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability that Adam has the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability that Adam has the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is not enrolled in the field (assuming the field is not specified).

Let us estimate these probabilities for the two fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): Suppose the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate given his interests. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and intelligence, the probability he has this personality sketch if he is enrolled in this field is likely high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering other fields less aligned with these traits, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): Suppose the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science, given the prevalence of this field and his intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, is also moderate. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving ability, the probability he has this personality sketch if enrolled in computer science is fairly reasonable but not as high as for agricultural science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering other fields, let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Now, we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the value of \( P(E) \) (the probability of the evidence) is the same for both fields, we focus on the numerator to compare.

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12 \]

For computer science:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12 \]

Since both values are equal, additional context or information may be needed to distinguish probabilities further. For this simplified model, we'll present them equally.

Thus:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5",
  "computer science": "0.5"
}

Note that actual probabilities should consider a normalization factor for \( P(E) \), but with equal numerators, this representation matches our assumption framework.
