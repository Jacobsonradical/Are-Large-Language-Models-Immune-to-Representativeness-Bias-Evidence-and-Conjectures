Let's make some reasonable assumptions and estimates based on the given personality sketch and fields. 

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science (denoted as \(H_1\))
2. Computer Science (denoted as \(H_2\))

### Step 1: Prior Probability - \(P(H)\)
Let's denote the prior probability that Adam is in these fields. Assume that being a graduate student in either of these fields is roughly equally likely in general, but since there are many graduate fields other than these two, we'll assign these priors moderately small.

- \(P(H_1)\) ≈ 0.1 (agricultural and veterinary science)
- \(P(H_2)\) ≈ 0.1 (computer science)

### Step 2: Likelihood - \(P(E|H)\)
Given the description of Adam:

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  - Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants: likely high.
  - Strong empathy and love for animals: likely very high.
  Thus, \(P(E|H_1)\) is expected to be high.
  \(P(E|H_1)\) ≈ 0.9

- For computer science:
  - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: likely high.
  - Enjoy solving puzzles: likely high.
  Thus, \(P(E|H_2)\) is expected to be moderately high.
  \(P(E|H_2)\) ≈ 0.6

### Step 3: Likelihood - \(P(E|\neg H)\)
Let's compute the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in other fields. Given Adam's characteristics, let's assume the following moderate values:

- \(P(E|\neg H_1)\) ≈ 0.3 
- \(P(E|\neg H_2)\) ≈ 0.4 

### Step 4: Compute Posterior using Bayes' Rule
The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to compute \(P(E)\) for normalization. But since we are comparing relative probabilities, this normalization term cancels out. For simplicity, we can ignore exact normalization as we want relative comparison.

So, we compute the unnormalized posteriors:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) \]
  \[ P(H_1|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

- Computer Science:
  \[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
  \[ P(H_2|E) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.1 = 0.06 \]

By normalizing, assuming these two fields sum to one for simplicity:

\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.06} \approx 0.6
\]
\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.09 + 0.06} \approx 0.4
\]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.4
