Bayes' Rule states that \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \). To find \( P(H|E) \) for both fields, we'll need to assess the probabilities of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

### Computer Science

1. **\(P(H)\) - Prior probability of Adam being in computer science:** Computer science is a common field for graduate study, but given Adam's strong appreciation for nature and animals, the prior might be lower than a field directly related to his interests.
   
   Let's assume \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.10 \).

2. **\(P(E|H) \) - Probability of Adam having the personality sketch given he's in computer science:** Someone in computer science might have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, but the love for nature and animals is less directly relevant to computer science.
   
   Hence, let's set \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.30 \).

3. **\(P(E|\neg H) \) - Probability of Adam having the personality sketch given he's not in computer science:** This involves considering all other fields, many of which might align more with Adam's interests in nature, love for animals, and empathy.
   
   Considering the diversity of other fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.50 \).


Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor and doesn't change the relative ranking, we can denote it as \( K \):

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.10}{K} = \frac{0.03}{K} = 0.03 \text{ (unnormalized)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\(P(H)\) - Prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science:** Given Adam's interest in nature and animals, this field is highly relevant.
   
   Let's assume \( P(H_{AVS}) \approx 0.15 \).

2. **\(P(E|H) \) - Probability of Adam having the personality sketch given he's in agricultural and veterinary science:** This field aligns very well with his interests and personality.
   
   Hence, let's set \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.80 \).

3. **\(P(E|\neg H) \) - Probability of Adam having the personality sketch given he's not in agricultural and veterinary science:** This is similar to the above estimate for \( \neg H_{CS} \).
   
   Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \approx 0.50 \).

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]

Again, using \( K \) as normalization:

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{K} = \frac{0.12}{K} = 0.12 \text{ (unnormalized)} \]

Since we are comparing these two fields without the actual values of \( P(E) \), we look at the relative values:

- **Computer Science:** 0.03 (unnormalized)
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** 0.12 (unnormalized)

After normalization, the values still reflect the same proportion.

Thus, we can present:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.12
}
```
