To determine the probability that Adam, given his personality sketch \(E\), was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science, we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \(P(E)\) is the same for both hypotheses and we are comparing the relative probabilities, we can focus on the numerator \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\) for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. The number of graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science in the U.S. is relatively small. For simplicity, we'll estimate this probability as moderate: 
   \[ P(H) = 0.10 \]
   
2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals, this is quite high:
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.85 \]
   
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is *not* enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that his interests are well-aligned with this field, this is relatively low: 
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \]

Using Bayes' Rule for comparison:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.85 \times 0.10 = 0.085 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Computer science is a relatively popular field among graduate students. We'll estimate this probability as high:
   \[ P(H) = 0.25 \]
   
2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science. Adam's traits align less with computer science, except for his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills:
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.40 \]
   
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is *not* enrolled in computer science. Given that his interests partially align, this is moderate:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.50 \]

Using Bayes' Rule for comparison:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.40 \times 0.25 = 0.10 \]

### Final Probabilities

Since we are only asked for relative probabilities, we don't need to normalize these values. We can present the relative strengths:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.085,
  "computer science": 0.10
}
```

It's worth noting that while Adam's chances were reasonably high for both fields given his personality traits, computer science had a slight edge due to higher prior probability, even though his personality aligns better with agricultural and veterinary science.
