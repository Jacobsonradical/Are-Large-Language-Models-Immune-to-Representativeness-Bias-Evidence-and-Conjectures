Sure, I'll evaluate the probabilities given the personality sketch of Adam and his traits. The values are subjective estimates for illustration.

1. **Hypothesis: Adam was enrolled in Computer Science (H = Computer Science)**

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in computer science.
  - Let's assume Computer Science is a commonly chosen field.
  - Let's estimate it at \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in computer science.
  - Adam's personality traits like a strong understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science.
  - However, his curiosity about nature and animals might make it slightly less likely.
  - Let's estimate it at \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in computer science.
  - Since Adam's traits might fit other fields (like agricultural and veterinary science) better, this probability could be relatively higher.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.4 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.46 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.13 \]

2. **Hypothesis: Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H = Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Letâ€™s assume this field is less commonly chosen compared to computer science.
  - Let's estimate it at \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Adam's traits like empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature fit well with this field.
  - Let's estimate it at \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Since his traits might fit with other fields such as computer science, this probability could be lower.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) \) is recalculated for this hypothesis:

\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.36 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.43 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.43} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.07}{0.43} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.163 \]

Thus, the values for the two hypotheses are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.13,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.163
}
```
