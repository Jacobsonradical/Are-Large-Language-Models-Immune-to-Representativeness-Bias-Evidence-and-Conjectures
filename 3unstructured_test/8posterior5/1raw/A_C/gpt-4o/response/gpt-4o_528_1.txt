To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following quantities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that specific field.

Then we can compute \( P(H|E) \) as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We won't be able to compute \( P(E) \) exactly without a full consideration of all possible fields, but we can compare the relative probabilities of the two hypotheses of interest.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **\( P(H) \)**: Given that Adam is a graduate student in the U.S., let's assume that a small fraction of students are in agricultural and veterinary science. For simplicity, let’s estimate this as \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, etc.) fit well with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign a high probability, say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he is in any field other than agricultural and veterinary science. Given the specific nature-centric traits, we will assign this a moderate value, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

### Computer Science
1. **\( P(H) \)**: Many graduate students are in computer science. Let’s estimate this as \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: While Adam's intelligence and love for solving puzzles fit well with computer science, his other traits (empathy, love for animals, interest in nature) may not match as strongly. Let’s estimate a moderate value for this, say \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he is in any other field than computer science. Given that his characteristics don’t strongly fit many other fields either, we can assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

### Calculation of \( P(H|E) \)

Using Bayes’ rule for both fields, we get:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Next, we normalize these values to derive:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.06} = 0.4 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.06}{0.04 + 0.06} = 0.6 \)
}

Given the normalization step, the relative probabilities suggest:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
