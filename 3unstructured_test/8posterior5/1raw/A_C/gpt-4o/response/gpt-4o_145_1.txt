Sure, I'll provide my reasoning and calculations below for each field based on the provided personality sketch of Adam.

### Field: Computer Science
#### Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)
We may consider that the likelihood of any given graduate student in the U.S. being in Computer Science is moderately high due to its popularity and demand. Let's assume:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \]

#### Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)
Adam has a quiet nature, enjoys solving puzzles, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits align well with the typical skills and interests of computer science students. Let's estimate:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \]

#### Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)
We need to consider the likelihood of Adam's traits given that he is not in Computer Science. Given that there are many fields where empathy, curiosity about plants, and a love for animals are well-suited, let's estimate:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 = 0.12 + 0.32 = 0.44 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.44} \approx 0.273 \]

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)
We consider that the likelihood of any given graduate student in the U.S. being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is moderately low as it is a specialized field. Let's assume:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.05 \]

#### Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)
Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals strongly fit this field. The likelihood is high:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.8 \]

#### Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)
We need to consider the likelihood of Adam's traits given that he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given that empathy, curiosity about nature, and love for animals might not be as emphasized in other fields, let's estimate:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.35 \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AgVet}})\]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.35 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.3325 = 0.3725 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.3725} \approx 0.107 \]
