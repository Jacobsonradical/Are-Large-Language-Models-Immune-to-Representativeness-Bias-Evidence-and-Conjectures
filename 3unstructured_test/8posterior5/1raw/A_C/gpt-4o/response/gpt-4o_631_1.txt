To estimate P(H|E) for Adam's potential graduate fields using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H) for each field.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are only interested in comparing the probabilities of different fields relative to each other, we can focus on the proportionality:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let’s consider the following for each field:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in that field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given that H is true.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing E given that H is not true (this will be generally high for common personality traits and interests).

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
- P(H): Let's assume the prior probability is average, say 0.1.
- P(E|H): Given Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, we can assume this is quite high, say 0.8.
- P(E|\neg H): Since other fields may not perfectly align with his personality traits, we'll assume this is moderately high, say 0.2.

For **computer science**:
- P(H): Let's assume the prior probability is average, say 0.15.
- P(E|H): Considering his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts as well as puzzle-solving skills, this probability is moderately high, say 0.5.
- P(E|\neg H): Again, since these traits could fit into other fields as well, we'll assume this is moderately high, say 0.3.

To simplify, we convert these qualitative assessments to actual values:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.2 \]
\[ \Rightarrow P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.5 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.3 \]
\[ \Rightarrow P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.15 = 0.075 \]

Based on these calculations, Adam is slightly more likely to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Computer Science. 

Here is the output in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.075
}
```

Note that this simplification helps to focus on the relative likelihoods without needing to compute the exact posterior probabilities.
