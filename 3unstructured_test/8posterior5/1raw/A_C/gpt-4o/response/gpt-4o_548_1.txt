To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to make educated guesses for the following:
- \( P(H) \): Initial probability that Adam is enrolled in either field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam is not enrolled in that field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science tends to attract individuals with a strong interest in nature, animals, and plants. It's a specialized field, so let's assume a relatively low but plausible initial probability, say \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (10%).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and his empathy, the likelihood that someone with his personality would be in this field is high. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) (80%).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - If Adam were in another field, the probability of him still having these traits will vary. While there are many fields where these traits are common, a less specialized field might have a lower probability. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) (30%).

Using Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.2286 \approx 0.23 \]

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**:
   - Computer science is a popular field with a broad range of interests. Let's assume a higher initial probability, say \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (20%).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's high intelligence and love for puzzles, there's a reasonable chance he would be in computer science despite the absence of a direct interest in nature and animals. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \) (40%).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - If Adam were in another field, especially one related to nature or veterinary science as prior, the likelihood might be higher. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \) (50%).

Using Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.4 \times 0.2 + 0.5 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.4} = \frac{0.08}{0.48} \approx 0.1667 \approx 0.17 \]

Finally, the posterior probabilities are:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.23,
