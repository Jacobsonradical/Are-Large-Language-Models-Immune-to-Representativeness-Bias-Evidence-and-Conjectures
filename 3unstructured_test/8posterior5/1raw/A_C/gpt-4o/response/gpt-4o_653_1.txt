To apply Bayes' rule to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch \(E\), we need the following probabilities:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in a given field (computer science or agricultural and veterinary science).
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in the specified field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is not enrolled in the specified field.
4. \(P(H|E)\): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.

### Computer Science

1. \(\mathbf{P(H)}\): Let's assume computer science is one of the more common graduate fields. Prior probability \(P(H) = 0.2\).
   
2. \(\mathbf{P(E|H)}\): Personality traits like high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, the deep love for animals and nature does not. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.1\).

3. \(\mathbf{P(E|\neg H)}\): Given that we are looking at all other fields, which might not align as closely with the personality traits but also are a broad category:
   - Given the wide range of fields, let's assume \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.04\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.04 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.032} = \frac{0.02}{0.052} \approx 0.3846
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. \(\mathbf{P(H)}\): This field is less common overall compared to computer science. Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.05\).

2. \(\mathbf{P(E|H)}\): Adam's traits like a deep love for animals, nature, and empathy align very well with this field. Let's assume \(P(E|H) = 0.6\).

3. \(\mathbf{P(E|\neg H)}\): For the fields excluding agricultural and veterinary science:
   - Reasonably, \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.05\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.05}{0.6 \cdot 0.05 + 0.05 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.0475} = \frac{0.03}{0.0775} \approx 0.3871
\]
