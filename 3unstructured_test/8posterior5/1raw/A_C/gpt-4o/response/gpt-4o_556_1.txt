Sure, let's consider the available information to calculate the probabilities using Bayes' Rule:

Bayes' Rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam is in a certain field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing E given H.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing E given not H.

For this analysis, let's assume some reasonable prior probabilities for each field. These values are hypothetical and are meant to guide the calculation process.

1. Prior Probabilities (\( P(H) \)):
   - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.25 \) (Since computer science is a common graduate field).
   - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.15 \) (Less common but still significant).

2. Probability of observing E given H (\( P(E|H) \)):
   - For Computer Science, the personality sketch partially fits as puzzle-solving and high intelligence is a common trait, but love for nature and animals is less so:
       - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.3 \)
   - For Agricultural and Veterinary Science, the personality sketch is a strong match due to the subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work:
       - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.7 \)

3. Probability of observing E given not H (\( P(E|\neg H) \)):
   - Taking it as a general average for non-agricultural science fields.
       - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.4 \)
       - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.3 \)

Let's calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

1. For Computer Science (\( H_{\text{computer science}} \)):

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) includes contributions from both fields, we approximate it by \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \):

\[ P(E) \approx (0.3 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.15) = 0.075 + 0.105 = 0.18 \]

Then:

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.18} = \frac{0.075}{0.18} \approx 0.417 \]

2. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\( H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \)):

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]

Using \( P(E) \approx 0.18 \):

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{0.18} = \frac{0.105}{0.18} \approx 0.583 \]

Thus, the final posterior probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.417,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.583
}
