To use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field given his personality sketch, we need to estimate various probabilities.

We'll compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Because \( P(E) \) is common to both fields, we will simplify the problem by comparing the numerators of Bayes' rule for each hypothesis.

### Definitions and Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a certain field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he was enrolled in a certain field.
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was not enrolled in a certain field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he was not enrolled in that field.

### Reasoning and Assumptions:
#### For Computer Science:
1. **P(H)**: Computer science is a common field of study in the U.S., so we might assign a moderate prior probability, say \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given the qualities described (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts), some fit with the stereotypical qualities of computer science students, particularly the intelligence and abstract thinking. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is harder to estimate, but let’s presume that many fields value these personality traits but not as strongly as computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(H)**: Agricultural and veterinary science is a less common field compared to computer science, so we might assign a lower prior probability, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The personality traits align fairly well with this field since it involves nature, plants, animals, warmth, empathy, and appreciation for hard work. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This remains broadly the same. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.25 = 0.10 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \times 0.10 = 0.07 \]

### Normalizing the Results:
To get the relative probabilities, we should sum the scores and divide each by the total sum to normalize them within these specific choices.

Sum of scores:
\[ 0.10 + 0.07 = 0.17 \]

Normalized probabilities:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.10}{0.17} \approx 0.588 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.17} \approx 0.412 \]

### Final Results:
