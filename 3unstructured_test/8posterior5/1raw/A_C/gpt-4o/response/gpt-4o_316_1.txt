Given the personality sketch of Adam and the fields provided, let's evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### Assumptions:
1. **P(H)**: The initial probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field without any additional information.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not in that field.

### Field: Computer Science
1. **P(H)** for computer science can be approximated by considering the overall proportion of graduates in that field. Say around 0.25 (25%).
2. **P(E|H)**: While computer science requires high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, it doesn't directly align with his empathy, love for nature and animals. This could be around 0.10.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given there are numerous other fields matching his personality sketch better, let's assume this is 0.90.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To make calculation easier, assume normalization where \( P(E) = 1 \), so:
\[ P(H|E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

This yields:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.10 \times 0.25 = 0.025 \]

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)** for Agricultural and Veterinary Science might be less common, so we approximate it around 0.05 (5%).
2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's characteristics strongly match this field. This is possibly around 0.80.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Since other fields could also match his personality, but less strongly. Suppose this is 0.50.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Normalization assumption:
\[ P(H|E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

This yields:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.80 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

# Final result:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.025,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
}
```
