Let's evaluate the probabilities step by step for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

   - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume that in graduate schools in the U.S., a moderate percentage of students are in this field. It could be estimated around 0.1.
   - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart, this fits well. We can estimate this to be quite high, maybe around 0.8.
   - **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of observing the same personality traits given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Since these traits can still be common in other fields but potentially less so, we can estimate it to be lower. Let's assume 0.3.

   Using Bayes' theorem:

   \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \)

   \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
   
   \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
   
   \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)
   
   \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \)

   So,

   \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} \)

   \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} \)

   \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \)

   \( P(H|E) \approx 0.229 \)

2. **Computer Science**:

   - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. Given the popularity of computer science, let's estimate it around 0.25.
   - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is in computer science. Solving puzzles and high intelligence fit well, but empathy and love for nature and animals might be less common. Let's assume this to be moderate, around 0.5.
   - **P(E|¬H)**: As before, the probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is not in computer science. We will keep this at 0.3 for consistency.

   Using the same method as above:

   \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \)

   \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \)
   
   \( P(H) = 0.25 \)
   
   \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)
   
   \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.75 \)

   So,

   \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.25}{0.5 \cdot 0.25 + 0.3 \cdot 0.75} \)

   \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.125}{0.125 + 0.225} \)

   \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.125}{0.35} \)

   \( P(H|E) \approx 0.357 \)
