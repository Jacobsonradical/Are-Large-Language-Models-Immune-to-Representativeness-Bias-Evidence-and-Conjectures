To calculate the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field of study given his personality sketch \( E \), we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We are interested in \( P(H|E) \) for the two fields:
1. Computer Science
2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

We will estimate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in the field.
- Note: \( P(E) \) remains the same across fields and can be considered as a normalization factor.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science. Let's estimate this is around 0.2 (20%), given the popularity of the field.
2. **P(E|H)**: Probability that someone who is in computer science fits the personality sketch. Given the abstract thinking and puzzle-solving nature fitting the field, but perhaps less common for a warm-hearted, nature-loving person, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \) (10%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Considering computer science is one field among many, and the personality sketch might fit better with fields related to nature and animals, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \) (20%).

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science, which is less common. Let's estimate this is around 0.05 (5%).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given the strong affinity for plants, animals, and understanding hard work, the personality sketch fits well. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \) (70%).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The personality sketch might fit better than average but not significantly so for the general non-agricultural/vet fields, so let's keep it around \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.15 \) (15%).

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

To make a direct comparison and omit the normalization factor \( P(E) \), we compare the numerators:

For Computer Science:
\[ 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ 0.7 \times 0.05 = 0.035 \]

### Result:

{
  "computer science": "0.02",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.035"
}

The values are between 0 and 1, representing comparative likelihoods, but they are not normalized probabilities summing to 1 because we didn't compute \( P(E) \). They are suitable for comparing the relative likelihood of the personality sketch fitting each field.
