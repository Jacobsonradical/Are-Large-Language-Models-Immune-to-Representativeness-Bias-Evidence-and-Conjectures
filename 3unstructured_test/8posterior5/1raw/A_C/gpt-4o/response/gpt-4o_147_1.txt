To assess the likelihood of Adam's enrollment in the specified fields based on the given personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' rule. Here are the steps and justifications for estimating each probability:

1. **P(H): Prior Probability**
   - This is the prior likelihood of being in a specific field before taking Adam's personality into account.
   - These values would generally be determined based on enrollment statistics in each field. For simplicity, let's assume the prior likelihoods for computer science and agricultural and veterinary science are both reasonable.
     - P(H) for computer science: 0.3 (since computer science is a popular field)
     - P(H) for agricultural and veterinary science: 0.15 (since this field is less common)

2. **P(E|H): Likelihood**
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field.
   - For computer science:
     - Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align with characteristics of computer science students.
     - P(E|H) for computer science: 0.7
   - For agricultural and veterinary science:
     - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication align strongly with this field.
     - P(E|H) for agricultural and veterinary science: 0.9

3. **P(E|¬H): Evidence**
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch regardless of his enrollment in a specific field.
   - Estimating P(E|¬H) involves considering how likely Adam's traits are amongst the general graduate student population, which includes students from various fields.
     - Let's assume:
       - General likelihood of Adam's traits is moderate.
       - P(E|¬H) for computer science: 0.4
       - P(E|¬H) for agricultural and veterinary science: 0.4

4. **P(H|E): Posterior Probability**
   - This is the probability of Adam being in a specific field given his personality sketch.
   - Calculated using Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
   - To simplify calculation, let's denote the denominators for normalization.

   For computer science:
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.7 \cdot 0.3 + 0.9 \cdot 0.15} \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.21 + 0.135} \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.345} \)
   - \( P(H|E) \approx 0.61 \)

   For agricultural and veterinary science:
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.15}{0.7 \cdot 0.3 + 0.9 \cdot 0.15} \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.135}{0.21 + 0.135} \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.135}{0.345} \)
   - \( P(H|E) \approx 0.39 \)

Thus, the probabilities of Adam being in the respective fields given his personality sketch are approximately:
