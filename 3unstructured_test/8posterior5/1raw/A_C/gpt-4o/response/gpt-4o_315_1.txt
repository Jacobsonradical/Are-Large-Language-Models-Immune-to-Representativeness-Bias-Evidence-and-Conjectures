To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, let's break down the terms:

1. **P(H)**: The initial probability (prior) that Adam is enrolled in the field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in the field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in the field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The probability that Adam is in the field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To make this calculation practical, we'll use an estimated value for each term.

### Computer Science

**P(H)**: Let's assume the prior for computer science is moderate since it's a common graduate field. Say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

**P(E|H)**: Given he has a genuine curiosity about nature/plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, it seems less likely he is in computer science. Assuming he might still be analytically inclined and enjoys puzzles, we'll assign a moderate value. Say \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

**P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of exhibiting these traits irrespective of not being in computer science might be higher. Say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H)**: Let's assume the prior for agricultural and veterinary science is lower as it's less common, say \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

**P(E|H)**: Given his strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants, it's quite likely he is a fit for this field. So, \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

**P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of exhibiting these traits without being in this field could be lower. Say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now, using these values, we'll calculate \( P(H|E) \):

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E)_{avs} = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the total probability of evidence) is the same across both calculations, we can simplify to compare relative probabilities:

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} \propto 0.04 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E)_{avs} \propto 0.035 \]

Now to derive a normalized probability for comparison:
\[ Total = 0.04 + 0.035 = 0.075 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.04}{0.075} \approx 0.533 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{avs} = \frac{0.035}{0.075} \approx 0.467 \]

The results indicate that despite the personality traits aligning more with agricultural and veterinary science, the prior for computer science being higher leads to a slightly higher posterior probability for computer science.

So the final answer is:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.533,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.467
}
