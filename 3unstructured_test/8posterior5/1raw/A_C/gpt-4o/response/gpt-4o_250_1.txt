Let's go through the Bayesian reasoning process step-by-step for each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

    - **P(H):** The prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign a value of 0.05 to this based on general enrollment data.
    - **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam would have the personality sketch E if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and love for animals, this probability could be relatively high. Let's assign a value of 0.8.
    - **P(E|¬H):** The probability that Adam would have the personality sketch E if he were not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This could be lower because his traits are quite aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign a value of 0.2.

    Now apply Bayes' rule:

    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
    \]

    Assume \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

    \[
    P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23
    \]

    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} ≈ 0.174
    \]

2. **Computer Science:**

    - **P(H):** The prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science. Let's assign a value of 0.15 to this based on general enrollment data.
    - **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam would have the personality sketch E if he were enrolled in computer science. Given his intelligence and interest in puzzles, this could be reasonable but not as high as with veterinary science. Let's assign a value of 0.5.
    - **P(E|¬H):** The probability that Adam would have the personality sketch E if he were not enrolled in computer science. Let's assign a value of 0.3.

    Now apply Bayes' rule:

    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}
    \]

    Assume \[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)\]

    \[
    P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.85) = 0.075 + 0.255 = 0.33
    \]

    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.15}{0.33} ≈ 0.227
    \]

Here are the final probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "computer science": 0.227
}
