Let's begin by assessing the probabilities for each field:

### Computer Science:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Graduate students often choose fields like computer science due to its job prospects and demand. Let's assume it is moderately common.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The probability that Adam has the personality sketch E given that he is enrolled in computer science. While curiosity and high intelligence match, the deep love for animals and nature isn't as common in this field. So, let's assume this is low to moderate.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science. Since there are many other fields where Adam's personality matches better, this could be moderate to high.

Using these assumptions:
- Let's set \(P(H_{CS}) = 0.3\) as a reasonable guess,
- \(P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.2\) since some characteristics match, but not strongly,
- \(P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.6\) because the description fits a broad array of non-CS fields better.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Less common but fits well with his love for nature and animals.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): The probability that Adam has the personality sketch E given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This fits very well.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This may be lower since the fit is quite strong for this field.

Using these assumptions:
- Let's set \(P(H_{AVS}) = 0.1\) as agriculture and veterinary science is less common.
- \(P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.7\) since the description closely matches this field,
- \(P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.4\) because while there are other fields, they don't match as perfectly.

Now, apply Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(E_{CS}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.6 \cdot 0.7 = 0.06 + 0.42 = 0.48 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.48} = \frac{0.06}{0.48} \approx 0.125 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E_{AVS}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.36 = 0.43 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.43} = \frac{0.07}{0.43} \approx 0.163 \]

Thus, the probability estimates for each field given his personality sketch are:

{
  "computer science": "0.125",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.163"
}
