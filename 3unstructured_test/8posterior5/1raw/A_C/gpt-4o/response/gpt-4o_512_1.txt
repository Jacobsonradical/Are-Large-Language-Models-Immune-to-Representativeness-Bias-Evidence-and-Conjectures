To solve this problem, let's use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll assess the probabilities \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of being enrolled in that field), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of Adam's personality sketch given the hypothesis), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of Adam's personality sketch given the negation of the hypothesis).

Since we don't have exact data and have to rely on logical deduction, let's make reasoned approximations.

### Computer Science

- **P(H):** Computer Science is a common field of study, so let's assume a moderate prior probability, say, 0.2.
- **P(E|H):** Given his curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving abilities, Adam's personality sketch fits well with the typical profile of a Computer Science student. Let's assume this probability is fairly high, say, 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Many other fields could also fit Adam's personality, so we assume a moderate value, maybe 0.3.

Now let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a sum of the probabilities across all possible fields, we will assume it results in a normalization constant, ensuring values sum to 1. For simplicity, let's estimate \( P(E) \approx 1 \), which isn't critical, as we just need relative comparisons:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.08 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H):** This field is less common than Computer Science but fits well with Adam's love for nature and animals. Let's assume a lower prior, say, 0.1.
- **P(E|H):** Adam's empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are highly relevant. Let's assume this likelihood is high, say, 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H):** Many other fields could fit Adam's personality as well. Let's assume 0.3 as before.

Now let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Again, for simplicity, we'll assume \( P(E) \approx 1 \):

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.07 \]

These probabilities are rough estimates, and accurate prediction would require more detailed statistical data, but this should give a comparative sense of the likelihoods.
