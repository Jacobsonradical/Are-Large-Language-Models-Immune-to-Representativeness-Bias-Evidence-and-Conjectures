Let's denote the following:

- P(H₁) = Probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(H₂) = Probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- P(E|H₁) = Probability of E given H₁.
- P(E|H₂) = Probability of E given H₂.
- P(E|¬H₁) = Probability of E given not H₁.
- P(E|¬H₂) = Probability of E given not H₂.
- P(H₁|E) = Probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given E.
- P(H₂|E) = Probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given E.

To compute P(H|E) using Bayes' rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Since P(E) (the total probability of observing the evidence E) is difficult to estimate without additional context, we'll focus on relative probabilities rather than absolute values.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H₁)**: Prior probability is reasonably high for someone with Adam's characteristics (he has a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals). Let's assume P(H₁) = 0.2.
- **P(E|H₁)**: The probability that Adam's personality fits if he is in agricultural and veterinary science is high. Let's assume P(E|H₁) = 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H₁)**: Since there are many other fields, let's assume an average probability for not being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's set P(E|¬H₁) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[P(H₁|E) \propto P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16\]

### Computer Science

- **P(H₂)**: Prior probability is reasonably low given Adam's interests and strengths, but students from various backgrounds do enroll in computer science. Let's assume P(H₂) = 0.1.
- **P(E|H₂)**: The probability that Adam's personality fits if he is in computer science is likely lower than in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume P(E|H₂) = 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H₂)**: Similarly, let's assume an average probability for not being in computer science. Let's set P(E|¬H₂) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[P(H₂|E) \propto P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02\]

Relative probabilities:
Total = 0.16 (agriculture and veterinary science) + 0.02 (computer science) = 0.18

Normalized probabilities:
- **P(H₁|E)** for agricultural and veterinary science = \(\frac{0.16}{0.18} \approx 0.89\)
- **P(H₂|E)** for computer science = \(\frac{0.02}{0.18} \approx 0.11\)

So the final probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.89,
  "computer science": 0.11
}
