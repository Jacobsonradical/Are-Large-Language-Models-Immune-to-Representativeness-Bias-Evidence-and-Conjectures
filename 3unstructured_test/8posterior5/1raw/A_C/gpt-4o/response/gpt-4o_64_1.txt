To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch without regard to the field.

Since we don't have exact numbers for these probabilities, we'll estimate them based on the given personality sketch \( E \).

### Estimations:

#### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): Let's say the prior probability for any student to be in computer science is relatively common, perhaps 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): For computer science students, having qualities like high intelligence and problem-solving skills are relatively common, but genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals might be less common in this field. We might estimate this at around 0.2.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that computer science is not the field, the personality sketch could occur due to other fields focused on nature and empathy. Let's estimate this at around 0.3.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): This is a less common field, so let's set the prior probability lower, perhaps 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): This field aligns very well with Adam's personality sketch (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals). Let's estimate this at around 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in this field, the likelihood of the personality sketch fitting becomes lower. We could estimate this at around 0.2.

### Calculation by Bayes Rule:

1. **Computer Science:**

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
   \]

   Without exact \( P(E) \), we evaluate it proportionally.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
   \]

   Again, evaluated proportionally.

Given the proportional framework:

Compute a normalization constant, \( P(E) \):

\( P(E) \propto P(E | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(E | \text{Agricultural & Veterinary Sciences}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural & Veterinary Sciences}) \)

Substituting values:

\( P(E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.08 \)

### Normalized Probabilities:
- \( P(\text{Computer Science} | E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.08} = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.08} = 0.5 \)

But this looks funny. Because actual normalization total is larger \( P(E) \textneeds to be integrated fully across all \ not Higher complexity showed in higher alignment precision.

So let's correct.

Simplifying, given exact profile spreads.
