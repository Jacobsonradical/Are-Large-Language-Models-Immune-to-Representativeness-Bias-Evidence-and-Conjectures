Given the personality sketch of Adam (E), we can consider the probabilities for the hypotheses that Adam was enrolled in different fields (H). Here’s how we can approach this:

**Hypothesis 1: Computer Science (CS)**

- **P(H):** Probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in Computer Science. Given it's a popular field, let's assume it's reasonably common among graduate students.
  - Estimate: Let's say P(CS) ≈ 0.15 (or 15%)

- **P(E|H):** Probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is in Computer Science.
  - While analytical skills (solving puzzles) are a strong fit, the deep love for nature, animals, and empathy may not align as closely with the stereotypical CS student. Hence, this is slightly low.
  - Estimate: Let's say P(E|CS) ≈ 0.3 (or 30%)

- **P(E|¬H):** Probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in Computer Science.
  - This probability can be influenced by how many non-CS fields align well with E.
  - Let's say there are several fields that match well with E, making this value reasonable but not extremely high.
  - Estimate: Let’s assume P(E|¬CS) ≈ 0.45 (or 45%)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|¬\text{CS}) \cdot P(¬\text{CS}) \]

\[ P(E) ≈ (0.3 \cdot 0.15) + (0.45 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(E) ≈ 0.045 + 0.3825 \]

\[ P(E) ≈ 0.4275 \]

So,
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.4275} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) ≈ \frac{0.045}{0.4275} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) ≈ 0.105 \]

**Hypothesis 2: Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**

- **P(H):** Probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  - This field is less common than CS but aligns more closely with Adam's personality sketch.
  - Estimate: Let's say P(AVS) ≈ 0.05 (or 5%)

- **P(E|H):** Probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  - The deep love for nature, animals, and a strong understanding of hard work align very closely with AVS.
  - Estimate: Let's say P(E|AVS) ≈ 0.75 (or 75%)

- **P(E|¬H):** Probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  - This value can be slightly lower, given that fewer unrelated fields might match well.
  - Estimate: Let’s assume P(E|¬AVS) ≈ 0.4 (or 40%)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS}) + P(E|¬\text{AVS}) \cdot P(¬\text{AVS}) \]

\[ P(E) ≈ (0.75 \cdot 0.05) + (0.4 \cdot 0.95) \]

\[ P(E) ≈ 0.0375 + 0.38 \]

\[ P(E) ≈ 0.4175 \]

So,
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.75 \cdot 0.05}{0.4175} \]

\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) ≈ \frac{0.0375}{0.4175} \]

\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) ≈ 0.09 \]
