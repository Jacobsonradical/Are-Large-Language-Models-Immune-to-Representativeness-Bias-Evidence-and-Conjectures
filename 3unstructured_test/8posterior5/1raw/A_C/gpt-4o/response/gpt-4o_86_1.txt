To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule for the given fields, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specified program.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given the specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is NOT in the specified field.

Bayes' Rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence, which can be calculated but for simplicity, we'll assume it to adjust our final relative strengths instead of computing exact values.

Based on the given personality sketch of Adam and the knowledge of typical graduate field characteristics, let's make sensible estimates.

### Computer Science

**P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science could be considered moderately high given the popularity of the field among graduate students, let’s assume 0.15.

**P(E|H)**: Given Adam's traits, such as high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, this probability is moderate, as these are typical traits for computer science students. So we can assume it to be 0.4.

**P(E|\neg H)**: This is the likelihood of a computer science pupil not showing Adam’s specific personality traits, which might still be moderate because CS students often are drawn to abstract problem-solving but might not necessarily have strong empathy or a deep love for animals, so let's assume 0.3.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H)**: The prior probability for this field could be lower compared to Computer Science due to its specialized nature, we assume 0.05.

**P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam showing the given traits (empathy, love for animals, appreciation for nature) given he is in this field would be very high because these traits align very well with this field, we can estimate it to be 0.9.

**P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of these traits showing up in graduates not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is probably low since fields unrelated to nature and animals might not reflect Adam’s personality, assume 0.2.

Now compute \( P(H|E) \) for each:

### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ = \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both and not calculated exactly, let’s assume:

### Relative Strength Conversion

- Computer Science: \( 0.4 \times 0.15 = 0.06 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.9 \times 0.05 = 0.045 \)

Now compare these strengths to the total probability space, simplifying others adjusting accordingly.

### Normalizing
Since \( P(H) + P(\neg H) = 1 \)

We compare the relative weights, assuming aggregates aspects don't match precisely but proportionally.

\[ \text{Sum of Weights} = 0.06 + 0.045 = 0.105 \]

\[ \frac{0.06}{0.105} \approx 0.571 \]

\[ \frac{0.045}{0.105} \approx 0.429 \]

So, the normalized probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": "0.571",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.429"
}
