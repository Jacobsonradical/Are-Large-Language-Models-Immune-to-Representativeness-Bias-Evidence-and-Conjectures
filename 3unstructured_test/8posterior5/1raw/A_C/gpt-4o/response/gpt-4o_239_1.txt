To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to consider the following probabilities for each field \( H \):

1. **Prior probability** \( P(H) \): The initial probability that Adam is in a given field, without any additional information.
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam’s personality sketch \( E \) would be observed if he were in the field \( H \).
3. **Marginal likelihood** \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam’s personality sketch \( E \) would be observed if he were not in the field \( H \).

We can then use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have precise numerical probabilities, we'll make qualitative estimates based on the provided sketch.
 
### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Considering the popularity and wide demand for computer science, the prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) might be relatively high but not extraordinarily so for a random graduate student.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s strong abstract thinking and puzzle-solving skills, the likelihood \( P(E|\text{CS}) \) could be moderate. However, his deep love for animals and nature doesn’t strongly align with typical computer science interests.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: For fields other than computer science, there could be a number of fields where Adam’s love for nature, empathy, and abstract thinking aligns, so \( P(E|\neg H) \) might also be moderate.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability \( P(\text{AVS}) \) for agricultural and veterinary science might be lower compared to computer science simply due to fewer students typically enrolling in these specialized fields.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood \( P(E|\text{AVS}) \) is high because Adam’s interests in nature, plants, and animals strongly align with this field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be lower in this case because fewer other fields might align with Adam’s specific interests and personality traits so well.

### Calculations
Without precise numerical values, estimations are as follows:

- Let’s assume \( P(\text{CS}) \) is around 0.2 (due to its popularity).
- Let’s assign \( P(\text{AVS}) \) around 0.05 (due to its more specialized nature).

For \( P(E|\text{CS}) \):
- Given the moderate fit, let's say \( P(E|\text{CS}) \) = 0.4.

For \( P(E|\text{AVS}) \):
- Given the strong fit, let's assume \( P(E|\text{AVS}) \) = 0.8.

For \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \):
- Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \) is 0.3.

For \( P(E|\neg \text{AVS}) \):
- Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg \text{AVS}) \) is 0.2.

### Normalizing Constant \( P(E) \)
To simplify calculations with just these two fields in consideration, an approximate normalization might be calculated as:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.05) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.08 + 0.04 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.12 \]

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.12} \approx 0.67 \]
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.12} \approx 0.33 \]

Thus:

{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.33
}
