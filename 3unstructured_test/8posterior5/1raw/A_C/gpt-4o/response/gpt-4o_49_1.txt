To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch, we'll apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:

- \( H_{\text{cs}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{\text{avs}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( E \) as the personality sketch provided.

We need to estimate:
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \) and \( P(H_{\text{avs}}) \) - the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \) and \( P(E|H_{\text{avs}}) \) - the likelihood of the personality sketch given each field.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \) and \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{avs}}) \) - the likelihood of the personality sketch given not being in each respective field.

Let's assume for the sake of this calculation (as exact values are difficult to determine without more specific data):
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.20 \): This is based on graduate enrolment statistics where a significant number of students are in computer science but not overwhelming.
- \( P(H_{\text{avs}}) \approx 0.05 \): Fewer students typically enroll in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.

Given Adam's described interests and characteristics:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.10 \): While computer science requires high intelligence and problem-solving skills, it doesn't strongly align with the empathy and love for nature.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{avs}}) \approx 0.70 \): Agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with Adam's interest in nature, animals, and empathy.

We'll assume \( P(E) \) is the same for each hypothesis as part of the normalization process in Bayes' theorem.

Finally, let's calculate:
1. \( P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \):
   \[
   P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{cs}}))}
   \]
   Here, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.50 \) as an average likelihood that doesn't strongly align or misalign with Adam's traits.
   \[
   P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{0.10 \cdot 0.20 + 0.50 \cdot 0.80} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.40} = \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048
   \]

2. \( P(H_{\text{avs}}|E) \):
   \[
   P(H_{\text{avs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{avs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{avs}})}{P(E|H_{\text{avs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{avs}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{avs}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{avs}}))}
   \]
   Again, let \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{avs}}) \approx 0.30 \) to generalize the likelihood for other fields.
   \[
   P(H_{\text{avs}}|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.05}{0.70 \cdot 0.05 + 0.30 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.285} = \frac{0.035}{0.32} \approx 0.109
   \]

So, our results are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.048,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.109
}
```

Please note, these values are estimates based on reasonable assumptions and may not perfectly reflect real-world statistics.
