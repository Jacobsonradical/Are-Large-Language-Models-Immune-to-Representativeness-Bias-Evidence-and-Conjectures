To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" or "computer science" given the personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since the total probability \( P(E) \) is generally complicated to compute without more information, we can still estimate the relative probabilities even without the exact values of \( P(E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \) (Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**:
   - This field might be less common among all graduate specializations, but it's not exceedingly rare. Let's estimate: \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's personality sketch aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science due to his genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication. 
   - So, \( P(E|H) \) is likely high. Let's estimate: \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, while some aspects might align (like empathy and intelligence), the alignment isnâ€™t as strong. Let's say it's moderate: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Now using Bayes' rule (the constant \( P(E) \) will be ignored for comparative purposes):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.1 = 0.06 \]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \) (Computer Science)**:
   - Computer science is a very common field for graduate students. Let's estimate: \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science, but his curiosity about nature and love for animals does not directly align with this field. 
   - So, \( P(E|H) \) might be reasonably high, but not as high as for agricultural science. Let's estimate: \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For fields other than computer science, the characteristics might also moderately align but impact varies widely. Let's say: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Now using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]

For computer science:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]

### Summary of Relative Probabilities

Given our estimates and normalization:

\[ \begin{align*}
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) & = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.08} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.429 \\
P(\text{computer science}|E) & = \frac{0.08}{0.06 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.14} \approx 0.571 \\
\end{align*} \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities relative to each other:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.429,
  "computer science": 0.571
}
