To apply Bayes' rule to these two fields of study, we'll need to consider the following probabilities for each field:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in that particular field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field, given his personality traits.

Since exact values are not provided for every variable, the answers will be based on reasonable assumptions.

### a. Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Assuming that the probability of a graduate student being in computer science is relatively high, let's assume P(H) = 0.3.
- **P(E|H)**: Considering Adam’s traits such as high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, these fit well with computer science, but his other traits (love for nature, animals, and empathy) are less closely related. Let’s assume P(E|H) = 0.4.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s traits outside computer science fields could also be considerable, especially in fields related to nature, empathy, and animals. Let's assume this probability to be relatively high at P(E|¬H) = 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]
\[  = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.4 \times 0.3 + 0.6 \times 0.7} \]
\[  = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.42} \]
\[  = \frac{0.12}{0.54} \]
\[  ≈ 0.22 \]

### b. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science is comparatively lower than computer science. Let’s assume P(H) = 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: Considering Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals, these traits are highly relevant to this field. Let’s assume P(E|H) = 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s traits outside this field is lower if not in fields specifically related to nature and animals. Let’s assume this to be moderate at P(E|¬H) = 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]
\[  = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.5 \times 0.9} \]
\[  = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.45} \]
\[  = \frac{0.08}{0.53} \]
\[  ≈ 0.15 \]

Therefore, the estimated posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.22,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.15
}
```
