Certainly. To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of having the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in the field \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of having the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in the field \( H \).

Let's consider each field individually:

### Computer Science
  
1. **\( P(H) \)**: Assuming that there are several graduate fields of specialization, let's denote a prior probability \( P(H) \) for computer science as 0.2, understanding that not all students major in computer science.
  
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's personality sketch does show high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which fits well with computer science, but the love for nature and animals isn't directly correlated with computer science. So, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.3.
  
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The hypothesis that Adam fits other fields well, especially fields not involving nature and animals, is more likely, so \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be higher. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) can be expanded as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

So:
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.4 = 0.46 \]

Now,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \approx 0.130 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
  
1. **\( P(H) \)**: Assuming there are several graduate fields, let's denote a prior probability \( P(H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science as 0.1, understanding this is a smaller niche field.
  
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's attributes (love for nature, animals, and empathy) fit strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. So, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.8.
  
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given that these attributes are not as common in other fields, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.4.

Again using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) can be expanded as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

So:
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.36 = 0.44 \]

Now,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.44} \approx 0.182 \]

So, the final posterior probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.130,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182
}
