To solve the problem using Bayes' rule, let's denote the following events:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( E \): The personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H_1) \), \( P(H_2) \), \( P(E|H_1) \), \( P(E|H_2) \), \( P(E|\neg H_1) \), and \( P(E|\neg H_2) \). Here \( \neg H_1 \) denotes enrollment in any field other than agricultural and veterinary science, and \( \neg H_2 \) denotes enrollment in any field other than computer science.

### Estimations:
1. **Prior probabilities \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \) (before seeing the evidence):**
   These could arguably be based on general enrollment statistics across all graduate fields. Let's assume:
   - \( P(H_1) \approx 0.05 \) (supposing 5% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science)
   - \( P(H_2) \approx 0.15 \) (supposing 15% of graduate students are in computer science)

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H_1) \) and \( P(E|H_2) \):**
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): Adam’s traits align well with studying agricultural and veterinary science (e.g., love for animals, appreciation for hard work). Let's assume this probability to be high, say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): Adam’s traits align moderately with computer science (e.g., high intelligence, good at puzzles). Let's assume this probability to be moderate, say 0.4.

3. **Overall probability \( P(E) \):**
   - \( P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1) \)
   - Similarly, for \( E \) in the context of computer science:
     \[
     P(E) \approx P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_2) \cdot P(\neg H_2)
     \]
4. **Probability of \( E \) given not in H_1 (\( P(E|\neg H_1) \)) and not in H_2 (\( P(E|\neg H_2) \)):**
   - Let's suppose that there are some other fields (e.g., ecology, biology) slightly less aligned with Adam's personality. Estimating this can be tricky, but a general probability might be lower:
     - \( P(E|\neg H_1) \approx 0.3 \)
     - \( P(E|\neg H_2) \approx 0.5 \)

### Calculation via Bayes' Rule:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} \approx 0.117
   \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.4 \cdot 0.15 + 0.5 \cdot 0.85} \approx 0.123
   \]

Therefore, based on the estimations and calculations, the result in JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.117,
  "computer science": 0.123
}
