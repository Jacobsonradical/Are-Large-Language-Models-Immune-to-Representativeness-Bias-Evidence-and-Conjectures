To solve this problem using Bayesian inference, we need to apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need estimates for the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

However, since we are comparing the probabilities for two specific fields, the exact value of \( P(E) \) is not necessary if we are just comparing the relative probabilities within the two fields.

Let's assign some reasonable estimates for these probabilities based on the given sketch and fields:

### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Let's assume a reasonable prior. Given the number of students in different fields, let's estimate this at around 0.2.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Computer science students can be intelligent and good at solving puzzles, but strong empathy and love for nature and animals might be less common. Let's assign this a lower probability, say 0.1.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Given the general distribution, let's assume this is 0.2.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Let's assume a reasonable prior. Given the number of students in different fields, let's estimate this at around 0.1.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): The personality sketch fits well with this field: curiosity about nature and animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work. Let's assign a higher probability, say 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Given the general distribution, let's assume this is 0.2.

Now, we can use Bayesâ€™ theorem to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.2} = 0.1 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.2} = 0.35 \]

So, the relative probabilities based on the given information are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35
}
```
