Let's break down the problem using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( H \) denotes the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field, such as agricultural and veterinary science or computer science, and \( E \) represents the given personality sketch of Adam.

To estimate \( P(H) \), the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a certain field:
- Since we're not given specific statistics, we can use general knowledge to approximate these values. Let's assume a roughly even distribution among possible fields given that graduate students are often evenly distributed among various programs. However, fields like computer science might have a slightly higher enrollment due to recent trends.

To estimate \( P(E|H) \), the probability that the personality sketch fits given the field:
- Agricultural and veterinary science: Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it aligns very well.
- Computer science: Adams' intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well. Although nature and animals are less directly related, the problem-solving aspect also aligns.

To estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability of the personality sketch fitting other fields:
- Given the nature-oriented parts of the sketch, the probability might be lower for non-related fields like humanities, social sciences, etc.

Finally, \( P(E) \) can be considered constant for normalization across fields, so we can compare \( P(H|E) \) relatively.

Here are the estimates:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume it's relatively moderate, around 0.1 since the enrollment rates aren't extremely high.
   - \( P(E|H) \): High probability, given the strong fit of the description, let’s say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate probability, given that Adam's personality fits other natural sciences and some aspects of other fields, let's estimate it around 0.3.

2. **Computer science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Slightly higher prior due to popularity, let’s say 0.15.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate probability, given Adam’s intelligence and abstract thinking fit but not the nature-related traits, say 0.5.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again, moderate, slightly higher than other unrelated fields, let's estimate around 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We get non-normalized values:

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

For **computer science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.15 = 0.075 \]

Thus, the relative probabilities (before normalization) are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.075
}
```
This suggests that, based on the personality sketch provided and my assumptions, Adam is slightly more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, given the traits described. Please note, these values are relative and indicative, not absolute.
