Alright, let's determine the required probabilities to apply Bayes' theorem for each field.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**(1) Prior Probability P(H):**  
This is the probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Graduate programs in agricultural and veterinary science are less common than some fields like computer science or engineering. Let's estimate:
\[ P(H) = 0.05 \]

**(2) Likelihood P(E|H):**  
This is the probability of observing the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) strongly suggest that agricultural and veterinary science could be a good fit:
\[ P(E|H) = 0.9 \]

**(3) Likelihood P(E|¬H):**  
This is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While empathy and love for animals can be found in many fields, the specific traits like curiosity about nature and love for plants might not be as common in other fields:
\[ P(E|¬H) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.235 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.191 \]

#### Computer Science

**(1) Prior Probability P(H):**  
Computer science is a very popular field among graduate students, so the prior probability is higher:
\[ P(H) = 0.25 \]

**(2) Likelihood P(E|H):**  
While Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science, his love for nature and animals is less typical for this field. Let's estimate:
\[ P(E|H) = 0.3 \]

**(3) Likelihood P(E|¬H):**  
Given the diversity of other fields, the personality traits might still appear occasionally, but not necessarily in computer science:
\[ P(E|¬H) = 0.25 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.25) + (0.25 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.075 + 0.1875 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2625 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.25}{0.2625} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.286 \]

In conclusion, given the data, here are the results:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.191,
  "computer science": 0.286
