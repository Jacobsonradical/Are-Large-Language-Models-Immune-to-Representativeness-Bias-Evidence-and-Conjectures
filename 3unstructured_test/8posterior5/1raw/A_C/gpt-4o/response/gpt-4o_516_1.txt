To apply Bayesian analysis to this problem, let's break it down step-by-step following your instructions:

Given:
* E: Adam's personality sketch.
* \(H_1\): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
* \(H_2\): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
* \(P(H_1)\) and \(P(H_2)\): Prior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in these fields.
* \(P(E|H_1)\): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
* \(P(E|H_2)\): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in computer science.
* \(P(E|\neg H)\): Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in these fields.

We will need to estimate these probabilities based on the information provided.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H1)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate it to be relatively low:
    - Assume: 0.05

2. **P(E|H1)**: Given Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of his personality sketch matching is high due to his love for nature, animals, and empathy:
    - Estimate: 0.9

3. **P(E|\neg H1)**: The probability of Adam having this personality sketch given he was not in agricultural and veterinary scienceâ€”but possibly in another field:
    - Estimate: 0.2 (since only certain fields align well with his personality traits)

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]

Where \(P(E)\) can be considered as the normalization factor for all considered hypotheses and their complements.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H2)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is in computer science. Likely higher than for agricultural and veterinary science:
    - Assume: 0.20

2. **P(E|H2)**: Given Adam was in computer science, the likelihood of matching his personality sketch is moderate due to his intelligence, interest in puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts:
    - Estimate: 0.4

3. **P(E|\neg H2)**: The probability of Adam having this personality sketch given he was not in computer science but in another field:
    - Estimate: 0.3 (since a reasonable portion of other students might also align with his profile)

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

But we simplify our assessment based on \(P(E)\) as a common factor and compare relative values for both hypotheses.

### Final Calculation (Scaled Relative Probabilities)

We can simply calculate the numerators relative to \(P(E)\) for simplicity (since \(P(E)\) will normalize these):

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H1|E) \propto P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) \]
\[ P(H1|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.05 = 0.045 \]

#### Computer Science

\[ P(H2|E) \propto P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) \]
\[ P(H2|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.20 = 0.08 \]

Given these relative probabilities, we normalize them:

Sum for normalization: \( 0.045 + 0.08 = 0.125 \)

Normalized probabilities:

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.125} = 0.36 \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.125} = 0.64 \]

So the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36,
  "computer science": 0.64
}
