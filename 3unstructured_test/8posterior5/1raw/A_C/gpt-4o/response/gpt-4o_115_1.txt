Sure, I will provide values based on a reasonable assessment of the information given:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - P(H): The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science may be higher given his interest in nature, plants, and animals. Let's assume it to be 0.3.
   - P(E|H): The observed characteristics strongly align with a person studying agricultural and veterinary science. As such, P(E|H) might be quite high, perhaps around 0.8.
   - P(E|¬H): For a person not in this field, having these traits is less likely but not impossible. Let's assume about 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
But since we don't have P(E), we'll calculate the proportional values:

\[ \text{Proportional to} \ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

2. **Computer Science**
   - P(H): The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence might be moderate. Let's assume this to be 0.2.
   - P(E|H): The traits of empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work do not strongly correlate with computer science. P(E|H) might be around 0.3.
   - P(E|¬H): Given Adam's traits, it's less likely but still possible. Let's set this at around 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ \text{Proportional to} \ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Aggregated information:
Since we assumed P(E|¬H) to be similar in both cases, the proportional values alone are sufficient to provide an estimate between the two fields.

Putting this into context:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.1
}
```

Note: These values are not absolute and are based on an analytical reasoning approach given the description. The actual values would require more detailed information and possibly more precise statistical modeling or empirical data.
