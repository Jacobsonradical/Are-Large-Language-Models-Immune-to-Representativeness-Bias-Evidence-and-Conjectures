Let's start with the probabilities and use Bayes' rule to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science, given the personality sketch \( E \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, let's assume that P(H) is moderately likely.
   - P(H) = 0.3

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of E given that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Most aspects of the personality sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals, appreciation for hard work) are highly consistent with this field.
   - P(E|H) = 0.8

3. **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of E given that Adam is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - These traits may still be somewhat common in the general population but not as strongly aligned.
   - P(E|¬H) = 0.2

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be thought of as a normalization factor. Since calculating \( P(E) \) exactly is complex and not necessary for this comparison, we can work with relative probabilities.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
   - Given Adam's high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, computer science is a plausible field, but less so than Agricultural and Veterinary Science given the provided sketch.
   - P(H) = 0.2

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of E given that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science.
   - Abstract thinking and puzzle-solving align well with computer science, but nature and animals are less directly related.
   - P(E|H) = 0.4

3. **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of E given that Adam is not enrolled in Computer Science.
   - These traits may be at least partially present in other fields but are less specific to computer science.
   - P(E|¬H) = 0.3

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

So now let’s compute the relative Bayesian probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri/vet}} \propto P(E|H)_{\text{agri/vet}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{agri/vet}} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri/vet}} \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} \propto P(E|H)_{\text{cs}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{cs}} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Normalizing:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri/vet}} = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.08} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{0.08}{0.24 + 0.08} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, given his personality sketch, are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
