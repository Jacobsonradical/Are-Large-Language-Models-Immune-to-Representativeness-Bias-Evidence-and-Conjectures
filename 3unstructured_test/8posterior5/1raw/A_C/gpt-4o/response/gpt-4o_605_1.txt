To calculate the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Theorem, we need the following probabilities:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of Adam having these personality traits given that he is enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of Adam having these personality traits given that he is not enrolled in the field.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}\]

For computational simplicity, we'll assume equal priors \(P(H)\) for each field and assign the following probability values based on the provided personality sketch:

### Step-by-step Calculation

#### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Probability Adam is in computer science. Assume a value of \( 0.5 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam having the given personality traits if in computer science. Given high intelligence and abstract thinking skills, let's assign 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam having the given personality traits if not in computer science. Let's assume 0.1.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.5}{0.4 \times 0.5 + 0.1 \times 0.5} = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.05} = \frac{0.2}{0.25} = 0.8\]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Probability Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Assume a value of \( 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam having the given personality traits if in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, let's assign 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam having the given personality traits if not in agricultural and veterinary science. Assume 0.05.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[P(H|E)_{AG} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.05 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.045} = \frac{0.08}{0.125} = 0.64\]

### Final Probability Estimates

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.8,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64
}
```

### Note
These calculations are provided with assumed priors and likelihoods, based on the suggested personality traits. The numbers can vary if different priors or likelihoods are estimated.
