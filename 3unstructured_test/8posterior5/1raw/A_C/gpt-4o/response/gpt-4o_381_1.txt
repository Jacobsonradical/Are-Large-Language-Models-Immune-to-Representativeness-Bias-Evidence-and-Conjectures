Let's evaluate the probabilities step by step.

### Assumptions:
1. **P(H)**: The initial probability that Adam would be enrolled in a particular field without considering his personality sketch.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is NOT enrolled in that specific field.

### Given Personality Sketch E:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants
- Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

### Fields:
- **Computer Science (CS)**
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

#### 1. Computer Science
**P(H) for Computer Science:** Given a broad range of graduate fields, let's assume P(H) = 0.1 (10%).

**P(E|H) for Computer Science:** 
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants: Low probability (0.2)
- Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles: Moderate probability (0.6)
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: Low probability (0.3)
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts: High probability (0.8)
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Moderate probability (0.5)

Let's approximate P(E|H) for CS to be an average: \[(0.2 + 0.6 + 0.3 + 0.8 + 0.5)/5 = 0.48\]

**P(E|\neg H) for Computer Science:**
- Given that non-CS fields could have a higher probability of matching this personality profile, assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.6

Now, apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ \text{Note: } P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.48 \times 0.1 + 0.6 \times 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.048 + 0.54 = 0.588 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.48 \times 0.1}{0.588} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.048}{0.588} \approx 0.082 \]

#### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
**P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Assume P(H) = 0.1 (10%).

**P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants: High probability (0.9)
- Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles: Moderate probability (0.6)
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: High probability (0.9)
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts: Moderate to high probability (0.7)
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: High probability (0.8)

Let's approximate P(E|H) for AVS to be an average: \[(0.9 + 0.6 + 0.9 + 0.7 + 0.8)/5 = 0.78\]

**P(E|\neg H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Given that non-AVS fields could have a lower probability of matching this personality profile, assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.4

Now, apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.78 \times 0.1 + 0.4 \times 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.078 + 0.36 = 0.438 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.78 \times 0.1}{0.438} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.078}{0.438} \approx 0.178 \]

### Comparison:

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.082,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.178
}
```
