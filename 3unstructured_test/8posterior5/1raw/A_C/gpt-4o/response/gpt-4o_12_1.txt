To apply Bayes' Rule for evaluating \(P(H|E)\), we need the following probabilities:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in a specific field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that specific field.
4. We will then use Bayes' Rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for all hypotheses, we can omit it for comparative purposes.

**Hypotheses:**
- **H₁**: Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- **H₂**: Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

**Assumptions:**
We do not have actual statistical data, but I'll make educated assumptions based on the description of Adam.

1. **P(H₁)** and **P(H₂)**: The prior probabilities. Let's assume both fields are equally likely on average, so \(P(H₁) = P(H₂) = 0.5\).

2. **P(E|H₁)**: The likelihood that Adam has the described personality sketch given he is enrolled in computer science. Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are consistent with a field like computer science. However, his empathy and love for animals might be less typically associated with computer science. Let's assume \(P(E|H₁) = 0.3\).

3. **P(E|H₂)**: The likelihood that Adam has the described personality sketch given he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals fit well here. Let's assume \(P(E|H₂) = 0.7\).

4. **P(E|\neg H₁)** and **P(E|\neg H₂)**: These include all other fields. For simplicity, let's assume the average likelihood for these is 0.5.

Now, apply Bayes' Rule for each hypothesis.

For **computer science**:
\[ P(H₁ | E) = \frac{P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H₂ | E) = \frac{P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses, we get:
\[ P(H₁ | E) = 0.15\]
\[ P(H₂ | E) = 0.35 \]

So, in terms of relative comparison, agricultural and veterinary science is more likely than computer science given Adam's personality sketch.

Here are the results in the required format:

  "computer science": 0.15,
