To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to first hypothesize values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here, \( H \) represents Adam being enrolled in a specific field, and \( E \) represents the personality sketch provided.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assign a reasonable prior based on general enrollment statistics and the match to Adam's characteristics. Suppose:
   - \( P(H_{\text{agri\&vet}}) \): 0.2 (20%)
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's deep curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, and his empathy, it is highly likely he would be in this field.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agri\&vet}}) \): 0.9
   
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Considering other fields that do not align as well with Adam's descriptions:
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri\&vet}}) \): 0.2

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, for simplicity, we will compare the relative likelihoods:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri\&vet}} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18 \]

### Computer Science:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Assign a reasonable prior based on enrollment and the characteristics' match:
   - \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): 0.25 (25%)
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills could hint at computer science, but it does not specifically align with his nature curiosity:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): 0.3
   
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For fields not computer science:
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \): 0.6

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.25 = 0.075 \]

### Final Values (normalized for comparison):
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.075} \approx 0.705 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.075}{0.18 + 0.075} \approx 0.295 \)
