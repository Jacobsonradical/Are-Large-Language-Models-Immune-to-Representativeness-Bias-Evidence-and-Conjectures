To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll need some estimates for these probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

Then, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

### Estimations

We will start with some reasonable estimates based on the given personality sketch and common knowledge.

#### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in computer science is around 0.1 (10%).
  
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given that Adam has a curiosity about nature, empathy, and love of animals, these traits aren't particularly associated with computer science. However, his high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills do have some correlation. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.3 (30%).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given that these traits aren't as strongly tied to computer science, we expect they are more common in the population. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.4 (40%).

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is around 0.05 (5%).
  
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's interest in nature, plants, empathy, and love of animals strongly suggest this field. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.8 (80%).
  
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Considering the traits are more expected in agricultural and veterinary science, they may be less predictive outside. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.3 (30%).

#### Bayes' Rule Calculation

We generally normalize the results considering the total probability, but as instructed, normalization here isn't needed since we don't have the full distribution.

\[
P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{(P(E|H) \cdot P(H))_{CS}}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{(P(E|H) \cdot P(H))_{AVS}}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, it will cancel out if we're only interested in comparing these probabilities.

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + \ldots
\]

Since we only need relative comparisons, we simplify to:

- \((P(H|E))_{CS} = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H))_{CS} = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03\)
- \((P(H|E))_{AVS} = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H))_{AVS} = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04\)
