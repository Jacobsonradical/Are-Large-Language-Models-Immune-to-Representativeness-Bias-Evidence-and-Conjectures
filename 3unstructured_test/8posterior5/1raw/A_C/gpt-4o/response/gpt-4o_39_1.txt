To apply Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the relevant probabilities. Here's how we can break this down for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without any other information.
   - Let's assume there’s a relatively low enrollment in such programs compared to other fields. Suppose P(H) ≈ 0.05.

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam having the given personality sketch \(E\) if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, he seems like a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. So, P(E|H) might be high.
   - Let’s estimate P(E|H) ≈ 0.9.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of Adam having the given personality sketch if he were not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - This is harder to estimate without more information, but we can assume it's relatively lower since the specific interests in plants and animals or empathy used in this field might be less emphasized in many other disciplines.
   - Let’s estimate P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.2.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science without any other information.
   - Computer science is more commonly pursued, so P(H) might be higher. Suppose P(H) ≈ 0.15.

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam having the given personality sketch \(E\) if he were enrolled in computer science.
   - While he enjoys puzzles, which aligns with computer science, his strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in plants are less directly related.
   - Let’s estimate P(E|H) ≈ 0.3.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of Adam having the given personality sketch if he were not enrolled in computer science.
   - This is likely slightly higher than for agricultural and veterinary science since his varied interests could still lead him to other fields outside of computer science.
   - Let’s estimate P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.5.

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg{H}) \cdot P(\neg{H})\), we can plug in the values to get:

That's the denominator of Bayes' rule. Now let's compute for each hypothesis:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg{H}) \cdot P(\neg{H})} \]
\[ = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.19} \]
\[ = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \]
\[ ≈ 0.19 \]

**Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg{H}) \cdot P(\neg{H})} \]
\[ = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.3 \cdot 0.15 + 0.5 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.425} \]
\[ = \frac{0.045}{0.47} \]
\[ ≈ 0.096 \]

So, our final estimates are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.19,
  "computer science": 0.096
}
