To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, I'll first estimate the necessary values and then apply Bayes' rule.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)** = P(Adam enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science): Given his traits—an interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy—it's reasonable to think it's moderately likely. Let's assume P(H) = 0.2.
- **P(E|H)** = P(personality sketch given H): His personality fits well with this field. So, let's assume P(E|H) = 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H)** = P(personality sketch given not H): This would likely be lower, as not all graduate fields would attract someone with his traits. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.1.

### Computer Science:
- **P(H)** = P(Adam enrolled in computer science): Given his high intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, it's also reasonable. Let's assume P(H) = 0.15.
- **P(E|H)** = P(personality sketch given H): While certain aspects of his personality, like solving puzzles and high intelligence, fit, other aspects like strong empathy and love for nature might be less relevant. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.4.
- **P(E|¬H)** = P(personality sketch given not H): As before, for the remaining fields, the probability might hover around the same estimate. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.1.

Now, we'll use Bayes' rule to compute \(P(H|E)\):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times (1 - P(H)) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.2) + (0.1 \times 0.8) = 0.16 + 0.08 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{0.24} = \frac{0.16}{0.24} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.15) + (0.1 \times 0.85) = 0.06 + 0.085 = 0.145 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{0.145} = \frac{0.06}{0.145} \approx 0.41 \]

Therefore, the approximate probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67,
  "computer science": 0.41
}
```

These values suggest that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science.
