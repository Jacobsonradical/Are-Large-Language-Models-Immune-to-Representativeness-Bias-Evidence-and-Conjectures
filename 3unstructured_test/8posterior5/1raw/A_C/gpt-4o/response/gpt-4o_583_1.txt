Given that Adam has a strong curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and a deep love for animals, it is more likely that his field of study is related to agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, we need to use Bayes' rule to formalize this intuition.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the fields of "computer science" and "agricultural and veterinary science," let's assign the following probabilities:

1. Prior probability \( P(H) \) reflecting the proportion of graduate students in each field.
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) reflecting the probability of Adam's personality sketch given each field.
3. Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) reflecting the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in the field.

Let's assume:

- P(H_computer_science) = 0.2 (20% of graduate students might be in computer science)
- P(H_agriculture_veterinary) = 0.1 (10% of graduate students might be in agricultural and veterinary science)

- P(E|H_computer_science): Given Adam's traits, his personality is not particularly aligned with a typical computer science student. Let's assume a low value like 0.1.
- P(E|H_agriculture_veterinary): Given Adam's traits (interest in nature, plants, animals), these align well with agriculture and veterinary science. Let's assume a high value like 0.8.

- P(E|\neg H_computer_science): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in computer science might still be fairly high because many other fields share traits like curiosity and empathy. Let's assume 0.7.
- P(E|\neg H_agriculture_veterinary): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science might be moderately high, assuming other fields might also fit well. Let's assume 0.5.

Now, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

For computer science:
\[ 
P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]

We approximate \( P(E) \) using total probability:
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \cdot P(\neg H_{cs}) \]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.02 + 0.56 = 0.58 \]
\[ 
P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.58} \approx 0.034
\]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ 
P(H_{agri_vet}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agri_vet}) \cdot P(H_{agri_vet})}{P(E)} \]

Approximating \( P(E) \):
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_{agri_vet}) \cdot P(H_{agri_vet}) + P(E|\neg H_{agri_vet}) \cdot P(\neg H_{agri_vet}) \]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.08 + 0.45 = 0.53 \]
\[ 
P(H_{agri_vet}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.53} \approx 0.151
\]

So, the Bayesian probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.034,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.151
}
```
