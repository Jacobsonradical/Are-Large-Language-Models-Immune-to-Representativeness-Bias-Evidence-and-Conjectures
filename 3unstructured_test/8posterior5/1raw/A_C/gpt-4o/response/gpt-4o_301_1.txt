Given what we know about Adam's personality and based on the provided fields, we'll evaluate the probabilities accordingly:

Firstly, we'll assign each probability based on the information:

**Probability of each field (P(H)):**
- We don't have specific initial probabilities for Adam's enrollment in any field, so we might consider assigning initial probabilities based on general interest or relevance to his personality traits.

**Probability of observing Adam's personality given the field (P(E|H)):**
- This will reflect how well each field aligns with Adam's described personality.

**Probability of observing Adam's personality given he is not in the field (P(E|\neg H)):**
- This reflects the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in a different field.

Based on these, we calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality, which we will infer from the context of probabilities.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H) for agriculture and veterinary science:** Let's assume a moderate initial probability, given that Adam loves nature and animals: \( 0.3 \).
- **P(E|H) for agriculture and veterinary science:** High, since it closely aligns with his love for nature and empathy: \( 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H) for agriculture and veterinary science:** Lower, reflecting that few other fields would align so well: \( 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

### 2. Computer Science
- **P(H) for computer science:** Assuming an initial probability based on general interest, let's assign \( 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H) for computer science:** Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts; hence moderately: \( 0.5 \).
- **P(E|\neg H) for computer science:** Considering other possibilities with intelligence and abstract thinking: \( 0.6 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(computer\ science|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both, we'll compare the relative, un-normalized values for easier understanding:

\[ P(agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.24}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(computer\ science|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1}{P(E)} \]

Now, we can normalize these for comprehensible results, with respect to other potential fields. Here are the unnormalized results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "computer science": 0.1
}
```

Since we are interested in the relative likelihoods:

\[ P(agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science|E) = \frac{0.24}{0.34} \approx 0.705 \]
\[ P(computer\ science|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.295 \]

So the final relative probabilities would look like:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```
