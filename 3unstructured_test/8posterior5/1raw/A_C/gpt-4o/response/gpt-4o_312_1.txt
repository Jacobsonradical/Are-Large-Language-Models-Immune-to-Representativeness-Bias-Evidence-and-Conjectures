To assess the plausibility of Adam being enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, I'll first approximate the probabilities as follows:

- **P(H)**: The general probability of a student being enrolled in either of the fields.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's personality and activities align with a student from either of the fields.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability that Adam's personality and activities align with other fields (not computer science or agricultural and veterinary science).

### Assumptions:
- P(H) for each field reflects the general distribution of students in various graduate fields.
- P(E|H) considers the likelihood of Adam's personality traits fitting the profile of students in that field.
- P(E|¬H) assumes a more general distribution of personality traits across all other fields.

### Probability Estimates:
#### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Computer science is a popular field, let's assume around 0.15 due to high enrollment.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking align well with computer science, but his strong empathy and warm heart don't strongly correlate with the typical computer science stereotype. Let's estimate 0.1.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability that students in other fields would share Adam's traits is high given the broad nature of those traits. Let's estimate 0.8.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This field is less populated than computer science. Let's assume around 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals is a strong fit. Let's estimate 0.7.
- **P(E|¬H)**: About 0.8, similar reasoning as in computer science.

### Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Given that:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(E)_{CS} = (0.1 \times 0.15) + (0.8 \times 0.85) \]
\[ = 0.015 + 0.68 = 0.695 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.695} \]
\[ = \frac{0.015}{0.695} \approx 0.0216 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E)_{AVS} = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.8 \times 0.95) \]
\[ = 0.035 + 0.76 = 0.795 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.795} \]
\[ = \frac{0.035}{0.795} \approx 0.0440 \]

### Final Results:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.0216,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.0440
}
```

These results indicate that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than computer science.
