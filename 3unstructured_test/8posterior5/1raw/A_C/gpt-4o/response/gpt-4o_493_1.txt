Sure, let's analyze the given information using Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem can be formulated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch (which can be derived from the law of total probability).

To simplify the calculation, we assume \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields, thus allowing us to focus on the relative probabilities. Since we don't have specific numeric data, we'll assign plausible values based on given personality traits and the likelihood of people with those traits being in each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{avs}}) \): Moderate prior probability because it's less common than some other fields but aligns well with his interest in nature and animals.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{avs}}) \): High probability because this field is a good match for his traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{avs}}) \): Lower probability as these traits are less central to other fields.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): High prior probability due to the popularity of computer science.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): Moderate probability because while quietness, intelligence, and problem-solving fit, the interests in nature and animals don't align strongly.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \): Moderately high probability considering the popularity of CS and that some of his traits (intelligence, abstract thinking) are common in other fields too.

Now, P(E) is a normalizing constant which would ideally be the sum over all possible fields Adam might be in, but since we are providing relative probabilities rather than absolute, P(E) will cancel out in the ratio.

### Calculations

For simplicity:
- Assume \( P(E) \) is the same across both fields.
- Assign hypothetical but reasonable relative prior probabilities.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H_{\text{avs}}) = 0.2 \) (20% because it's less common but fits his interests somewhat well).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{avs}}) = 0.9 \) (90% as traits align well).

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.5 \) (50% due to its popularity).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.6 \) (60% since some traits align but key interests do not).

Applying Bayes' Theorem conceptually:

\[ P(H_{\text{avs}} | E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{avs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{avs}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}} | E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \]

Ignoring \( P(E) \) for ratio:
\[ P(H_{\text{avs}} | E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}} | E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.5 = 0.3 \]

### Results:

Given the relative nature of the smaller dataset:
\[ 
\begin{align*}
\text{{agricultural and veterinary science}}: & \approx 0.18 \\
\text{{computer science}}: & \approx 0.3 
\end{align*}
\]

Final answer:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
