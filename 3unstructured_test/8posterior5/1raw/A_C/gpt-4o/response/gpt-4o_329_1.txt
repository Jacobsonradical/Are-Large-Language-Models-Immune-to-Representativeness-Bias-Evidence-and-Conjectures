To estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), we consider both inherent likelihoods and specific match programs for Adam's characteristics. Then, we use these to determine \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: This is the probability that a given random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \) as it's relatively specialized.
  
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and genuine empathy, these traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
  
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability that a student with Adam's personality sketch is in a different field. Traits like empathy and curiosity about nature are not exclusive to agricultural and veterinary science but less likely in other fields. Let's consider \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

Calculate:
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.95 = 0.045 + 0.19 = 0.235 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.235} = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \approx 0.1915 \]

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \), a more common field in graduate studies.
  
- **P(E|H)**: Traits such as high intelligence and enjoyment in solving puzzles align well with computer science. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
  
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Similar traits may be found in other fields. Given Adam's traits that somewhat fit with both sciences, let's use \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

Calculate:
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \times 0.15 + 0.25 \times 0.85 = 0.09 + 0.2125 = 0.3025 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.15}{0.3025} = \frac{0.09}{0.3025} \approx 0.2976 \]
