To apply Bayes' theorem, which is \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \], we first need to make reasonable estimates of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field. 

Let's start by making these estimates for "agricultural and veterinary science" and "computer science".

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
1. \( P(H) \) (prior probability Adam was enrolled in this field): Without additional information about the distribution of graduate students across fields, we could assume this probability to be relatively low, since not every student is in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Thus, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood Adam has the personality sketch if he was in this field): Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, this is likely a good fit. Assume this to be high, say \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood Adam has the personality sketch if he was not in this field): Since Adam's characteristics can also apply to other fields apart from agricultural and veterinary science, this is still probable but less so. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

**Computer Science:**
1. \( P(H) \) (prior probability Adam was enrolled in this field): Computer science is relatively common among graduate students. Assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood Adam has the personality sketch if he was in this field): While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are a good fit, his deep love for nature and animals is less characteristic. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood Adam has the personality sketch if he was not in this field): Suppose similar to the above assumption. \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.9)(0.1) + (0.3)(0.9) = 0.09 + 0.27 = 0.36 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.9)(0.1)}{0.36} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.4)(0.2) + (0.3)(0.8) = 0.08 + 0.24 = 0.32 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.4)(0.2)}{0.32} = \frac{0.08}{0.32} = 0.25 \]

Combining everything together:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

However, note that in reality, fields have different base rates and the specifics about Adam might better differentiate these probabilities. These assumptions are taken for illustrative purposes based on the given scenario and should be refined with more precise data if available.
