To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to consider the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that specific field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field given his personality sketch, which is calculated using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch) is constant for both fields, we can compare the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) directly using:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's estimate these values for each field.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): While we don't have exact data, it's reasonable to assume there are fewer agricultural and veterinary science students than computer science students, so let's assign this a somewhat lower base value, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, and his strong empathy, this likelihood is very high, let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of this personality sketch in the general population of non-agricultural and non-veterinary science students is lower, perhaps \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Thus, for agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18 \]

### 2. Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a very common graduate field, so this prior probability might be higher. We'll estimate, \( P(H) = 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits are less directly indicative of Computer Science, perhaps \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of having this personality sketch in the general population of non-computer science students might be similar or slightly higher if we consider students in science and technology in general, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Thus, for computer science:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.4 = 0.16 \]

Now, let's normalize these values for comparison so that they sum to 1 over these two fields:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.16} \approx 0.53 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.18 + 0.16} \approx 0.47 \]

However, you asked for values that do not need to total 1, so the proportional rather than normalized values can be given.

Here are the final proportional results:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18,
  "computer science": 0.16
