To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields using Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch matches someone in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch matches someone not in that field.

We'll assume that the prior \( P(H) \) for any specific field is initially equal, since we do not have any prior information that suggests Adam is more likely to be in one field over another. Therefore, \( P(H) \) for any field is 0.5 here just for our comparative calculation exercise.

Next, we'll assign values to \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on how well Adam's personality sketch matches typical profiles for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and empathy, it's likely a good match.
  Let's assign a value of 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam's personality fits the general student profile of other fields.
  Let's give this a 0.2 (general fit but less specific).
  
Now apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{(0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5)} = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

### Computer Science
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which can be associated with computer science. However, there's less emphasis on his natural curiosity towards nature and animals, so let's set a moderate value.
  Let's assign a value of 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Generally similar to the above estimate.
  Let's also give this a 0.3 (slightly higher due to shared attributes).

Now apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.5}{(0.4 \times 0.5) + (0.3 \times 0.5)} = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.57 \]

Thus, our updated probabilities are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.57
}
```
