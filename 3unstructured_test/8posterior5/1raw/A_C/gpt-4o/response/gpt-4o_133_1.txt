First, let's break down the information provided:

### Definitions and Assumptions:
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability that the personality sketch \(E\) of Adam is observed if he was enrolled in that field \(H\).
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability that the personality sketch \(E\) of Adam is observed if he was not enrolled in that field \(H\).
- \(P(H|E)\): The probability that Adam was enrolled in that field \(H\) given the personality sketch \(E\).

### Information about Adam:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals.
- Appreciates hard work and dedication.

### Hypotheses:
1. Computer Science
2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

We now make assumptions to assign probabilities to the priors and likelihoods based on the personality sketch.

### Assumptions for Computer Science:
- \(P(H_{CS})\): We assume that the base rate of students in computer science is high, let's say 0.1 (about 10% of all graduate students).
- \(P(E|H_{CS})\): The sketch describes some traits that fit a computer science student (problem-solving, high intelligence), but lacks emphasis on tech interest, let's assume 0.3.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{CS})\): For non-CS students, the traits might be equally or more likely, so let's assume a high value like 0.7.

### Assumptions for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \(P(H_{AVS})\): We assume the base rate is lower than computer science, perhaps 0.05 (about 5% of all graduate students).
- \(P(E|H_{AVS})\): The sketch strongly aligns with interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, so let's assume a high likelihood, say 0.8.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{AVS})\): For non-AVS students, the traits are less common, so let's assign a value of 0.3.

We can use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

### Calculation for Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS})}{P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS})P(\neg H_{CS})} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{(0.3 \times 0.1) + (0.7 \times 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.63} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.66} \approx 0.045 \]

### Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS})P(H_{AVS})}{P(E|H_{AVS})P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS})P(\neg H_{AVS})} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{(0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.3 \times 0.95)} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.285} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.325} \approx 0.123 \]
