To make an informed estimate, let's break down the probabilities given the personality sketch of Adam and the hypotheses in question:

1. **Hypothesis H: Adam was enrolled in computer science (CS)**
   - **P(H_C):** The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student in the U.S. is studying computer science. Let's assume a base rate for CS graduate students, say approximately 0.15 (15%).
   - **P(E|H_C):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is studying computer science. Adam’s curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals might be less common attributes in computer science, where analytical and technical skills are more emphasized. I'll estimate this as 0.3.
   - **P(E|\neg H_C):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not studying computer science. Given that there are many other fields that could align with Adam's qualities, this might be relatively higher. I'll estimate this as 0.6.

2. **Hypothesis H: Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (AVS)**
   - **P(H_A):** The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student in the U.S. is studying agricultural and veterinary science. The base rate might be lower than CS, but let’s assume it's approximately 0.05 (5%).
   - **P(E|H_A):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is studying AVS. Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals fits well within this field. I'll estimate this as relatively high, say 0.9.
   - **P(E|\neg H_A):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not studying AVS. Since he has qualities likely more specific to AVS, this might be lower than for CS. I'll estimate this as 0.5.
   
Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that:

\[ P(E) = (P(E|H_C) \cdot P(H_C)) + (P(E|\neg H_C) \cdot P(\neg H_C)) \]

For computer science:

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.15) + (0.6 \cdot 0.85) = 0.045 + 0.51 = 0.555 \]

Therefore:

\[ P(H_C|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.555} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.555} \approx 0.081 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.5 \cdot 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.475 = 0.52 \]

Therefore:

\[ P(H_A|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.52} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.52} \approx 0.087 \]

Combining the results, we have:

{
  "computer science": 0.081,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.087
}
