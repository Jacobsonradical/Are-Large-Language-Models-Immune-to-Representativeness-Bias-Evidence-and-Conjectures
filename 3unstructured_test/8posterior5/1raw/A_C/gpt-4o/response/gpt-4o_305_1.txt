To compute the probabilities P(H|E) for the fields of "computer science" and "agricultural and veterinary science," we will utilize Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
- CS as computer science,
- AVS as agricultural and veterinary science.

Firstly, let's reasonably estimate the prior probabilities (P(H)) and the conditional probabilities (P(E|H) and P(E|¬H)):

1. **Prior Probabilities (P(H))**:
   - P(CS): This is the probability that any given graduate student is in computer science. Assuming a moderate proportion of graduate students are in this field, let's set it to 0.2 (or 20%).
   - P(AVS): This is the probability that any given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming a smaller proportion of graduate students are in this field compared to computer science, let's set it to 0.05 (or 5%).

2. **Conditional Probabilities (P(E|H))**:
   - P(E|CS): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits a computer science student. Given his intelligence and ability to solve puzzles, this value should be relatively high. However, considering his empathy and love for nature and animals, this may not be as high as in the AVS field. Thus, we can estimate it to be 0.4.
   - P(E|AVS): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits an agricultural and veterinary science student. Given his warm heart, empathy, and deep love for animals, this field seems quite fitting. Let's estimate it to be 0.9.

3. **Complementary Conditional Probabilities (P(E|¬H))**:
    - P(E|¬CS): This is the probability that Adam's personality fits any other student not in computer science. Given the diverse range of fields, but considering the specifics of Adam's profile, let's estimate it to be 0.2.
    - P(E|¬AVS): This is the probability that Adam's personality fits any other student not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the diverse range of fields, let's estimate it to be 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(AVS|E) = \frac{P(E|AVS) \cdot P(AVS)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor ensuring the total probability sums to 1 and can be calculated by:

\[ P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|AVS) \cdot P(AVS) + P(E|¬CS) \cdot P(¬CS) + P(E|¬AVS) \cdot P(¬AVS) \]

However, since we are only interested in the relative probabilities for these two fields, the denominator is not necessary for comparative purposes:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|AVS) \cdot P(AVS) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.045 + 0.16 + 0.285} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.57} \approx 0.14 \]

\[ P(AVS|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.57} \approx 0.08 \]

Therefore:

{
  "computer science": "0.14",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.08"
}

It's important to note that these values are rough estimates and should ideally be adjusted with real-world data for higher accuracy.
