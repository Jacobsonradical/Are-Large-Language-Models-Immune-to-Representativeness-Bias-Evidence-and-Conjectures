Let's break down the process to arrive at our results.

### Computer Science (CS)
1. **Prior Probability, P(H_CS):**
   - CS is a common field. Let's assume the prior probability is moderate, say around 0.2.

2. **Likelihood, P(E|H_CS):**
   - Adam’s interests in nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and love for animals, do not strongly align with a typical CS profile.
   - His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align with CS, but it is not strong enough to outweigh the previous factors.
   - Therefore, let's assign a likelihood of 0.2.

3. **Complementary Likelihood, P(E|¬H_CS):**
   - Given the personality traits, they seem more likely in fields related to nature and animals rather than in CS.
   - Therefore, let’s assign this a higher value, such as 0.7.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)
1. **Prior Probability, P(H_AVS):**
   - AVS is less common than CS, so let's assume a lower prior probability, such as 0.1.

2. **Likelihood, P(E|H_AVS):**
   - Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, empathy, and dedication fit well into AVS.
   - Therefore, let’s assign this a higher value, such as 0.8.

3. **Complementary Likelihood, P(E|¬H_AVS):**
   - If Adam were not in AVS, it would likely be harder to explain his interest in nature and animals as well.
   - Therefore, let's assign a lower value, such as 0.5.

### Bayesian Calculation
We use Bayes' Theorem: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

We can compare the relative probabilities without knowing the exact value of P(E) because we're more interested in the ratio of the probabilities.

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

The ratios show how likely each hypothesis is relative to each other given the evidence.

### Final Relative Probabilities
When comparing \( \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \) to \( \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \), we can see that:

\[ \frac{P(H_{AVS}|E)}{P(H_{CS}|E)} = \frac{0.08}{0.04} = 2 \]

This means that given the evidence, AVS is twice as likely as CS. To provide values between 0 and 1 while noting that these are relative, we can normalize them:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]

Final output:
