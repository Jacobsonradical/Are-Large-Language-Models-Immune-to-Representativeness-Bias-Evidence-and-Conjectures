To compute \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

Let's make some reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch and the fields:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field without the personality sketch.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits given that he is not enrolled in that field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, which we need to compute.

### Estimations:

**Computer Science:**

1. **P(H)**: This could be estimated by the general proportion of students in graduate programs in computer science. Assuming an even distribution among major fields, let's say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's interest in abstract concepts aligns well with computer science, while his empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not align directly. Let's estimate this as \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone with Adam's traits would be found in any other field. Since the fields are numerous and diverse, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.02 \).

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

1. **P(H)**: The proportion of students in agricultural and veterinary science programs. Assuming an even distribution among major fields, let's say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's love for nature, appreciation for hard work, and deep empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this as \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone with Adam's traits would be found in any other field. We will use the same previous estimate, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.02 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \), let's compute it for each case:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.02 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.016 = 0.036 \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.036} = \frac{0.02}{0.036} \approx 0.556 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.02 \cdot 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.018 = 0.088 \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.088} = \frac{0.07}{0.088} \approx 0.795 \)

So, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.556,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.795
}
