To solve the problem using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the probabilities as follows:

1. **P(H) - The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.** 
   This is the general probability that a random graduate student might be in a given field. For simplicity, we'll assume the priors are equal for each field and set them both to the same value.

2. **P(E|H) - The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field.** 
   This measures how well Adam's personality sketch fits each field.

3. **P(E|\neg H) - The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that field.** 
   This measures how well the personality sketch fits other fields, not including the one in question.

4. **P(H|E) - The posterior probability of Adam being in that field given his personality sketch.** 
   This is what we are trying to compute using Bayes' rule: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) 
   Here, P(E) is the normalizing constant, and we can write it in terms of our two hypotheses and their complements.

Let's go through the details:

### Computation

#### Computer Science:
1. P(H): Prior probability Adam is in Computer Science. 
   - Set to 0.1 (assuming a very general distribution where each field has equal prior probabilities).

2. P(E|H): Likelihood of Adam's personality given he studies Computer Science.
   - Given Adam's traits such as intelligence, problem-solving, and abstract thinking, he could fit. Let's assign this a high value, say 0.6.

3. P(E|\neg H): Likelihood of Adam's personality given he studies any other field except Computer Science.
   - This is quite broad, but considering Adam's traits, he could also fit moderately in many other fields. So let's assign this a lower value, say 0.2.

Using these values, we can now calculate the posterior using Bayes' rule:

P(H|E)_CS = [P(E|H)_CS * P(H)_CS] / [P(E)]
          = (0.6 * 0.1) / [(0.6 * 0.1) + (0.2 * 0.9)]
          = 0.06 / (0.06 + 0.18)
          = 0.06 / 0.24
          = 0.25

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. P(H): Prior probability Adam is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. 
   - Set to 0.1 for simplicity.

2. P(E|H): Likelihood of Adam's personality given he studies Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Given Adam's traits such as empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work, he could fit very well. Let's assign this a high value, say 0.8.

3. P(E|\neg H): Likelihood of Adam's personality given he studies any other field except Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - The same reasoning as above, assign it a value of 0.2.

Using these values, we can now calculate the posterior using Bayes' rule:

P(H|E)_AVS = [P(E|H)_AVS * P(H)_AVS] / [P(E)]
           = (0.8 * 0.1) / [(0.8 * 0.1) + (0.2 * 0.9)]
           = 0.08 / (0.08 + 0.18)
           = 0.08 / 0.26
           = 0.3077
