To compute \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, using Bayes' Rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). For simplicity, we will assume that the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field can be considered roughly equal because we lack precise information about the distribution of graduate students across fields. 

We will assume:

1. \( P(H) \) (prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field): Assume the given fields are equally likely initially.
2. \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood that Adam exhibits the described personality traits given he is in that field): Based on the personality sketch, we determine how well the traits fit the fields.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) (evidence for Adam's traits if he is not in that specific field): Considering that there are multiple other fields, assume this is moderate for each specific field since the traits are somewhat common.

Given these assumptions, let's estimate:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.5 \) (Assuming roughly half of all relevant students may fit into this field given nature and animals are deeply tied to this field.)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \) (The traits match well: curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work.)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) (The personality traits could still match other fields to some extent but less perfectly.)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.5}{0.9 \times 0.5 + 0.3 \times 0.5} = \frac{0.45}{0.45 + 0.15} = \frac{0.45}{0.60} \approx 0.75 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.5 \) (Assume roughly all relevant students might fit into either category of interest.)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \) (The personality traits match less well here; quiet and high intelligence fit, but love for nature and animals is not strongly relevant.)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) (The personality traits could still moderately fit due to empathy and appreciation for dedication.)

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.5}{0.4 \times 0.5 + 0.3 \times 0.5} = \frac{0.20}{0.20 + 0.15} = \frac{0.20}{0.35} \approx 0.57 \]

Based on the above calculation, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "computer science": "0.57"
}
