To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following values:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field (agricultural and veterinary science or computer science).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that particular field.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**:
   - We assume that the proportion of students in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively small compared to more popular fields like computer science. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) to be 0.05 (5%).

2. **Probability of Evidence given Hypothesis (\( P(E|H) \))**:
   - Adam has a warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals, etc., which align well with characteristics often found in this field.
   - Let's assign a high value: \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **Probability of Evidence given not Hypothesis (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**:
   - While these characteristics could belong to students in other fields, they may not align as closely as they do with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let’s assign a moderate value: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using the values, we get:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95 = 0.035 + 0.285 = 0.32 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.32} = \frac{0.035}{0.32} \approx 0.1094 \]

### Computer Science:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**:
   - Given the popularity of computer science among graduate students, let's estimate \( P(H) \) to be 0.20 (20%).

2. **Probability of Evidence given Hypothesis (\( P(E|H) \))**:
   - While Adam's curiosity and intelligence align with typical computer science students, the strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication might be less dominant.
   - Let’s assign a moderate value: \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. **Probability of Evidence given not Hypothesis (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**:
   - Since the characteristics could still fit a range of other fields, we can assume the same moderate probability.
   - Let’s assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using the values, we get:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.20 + 0.4 \cdot 0.80 = 0.08 + 0.32 = 0.4 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.20}{0.4} = \frac{0.08}{0.4} = 0.2 \]

Now we present the results in the required format:
