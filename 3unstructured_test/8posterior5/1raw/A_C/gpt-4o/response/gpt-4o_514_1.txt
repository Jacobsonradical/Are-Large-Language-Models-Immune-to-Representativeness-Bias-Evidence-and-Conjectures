To apply Bayes' rule and compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that the personality sketch \( E \) would occur given that Adam is enrolled in the particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that the personality sketch \( E \) would occur given that Adam is not enrolled in the particular field.
  
Once we have these estimates, we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's evaluate each field based on the provided information.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This depends on the general distribution of graduate students in the U.S. Given that agricultural and veterinary science is a specialized field, let's assume it has a low to moderate prior probability, e.g., 0.1.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Considering Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and a warm heart, it's very likely that someone with his characteristics would be in this field, e.g., 0.8.
- **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that someone not in agricultural and veterinary science would have this personality profile should be lower, e.g., 0.2.

**Computer Science**:

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a very common graduate field in the U.S., so we'll assign a higher prior probability, e.g., 0.25.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: While Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills fit well with computer science, his empathy and love for nature and animals are not typical for computer science students. We'll assign a moderate probability here, e.g., 0.4.
- **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that someone not in computer science would have Adam's personality profile might be higher than for computer science but not too high considering the general population of all other fields, e.g., 0.7.

Next, compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule. For simplicity, weâ€™ll use normalized factors since we don't have the exact value for \( P(E) \), as follows:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

**Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.25 = 0.1 \]

Thus, in normalized form, they become:
\[ P(H|E) (agricultural) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.1} \approx 0.44 \]
\[ P(H|E) (computer) = \frac{0.1}{0.08 + 0.1} \approx 0.56 \]

Therefore, the approximate probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.44",
  "computer science": "0.56"
}
