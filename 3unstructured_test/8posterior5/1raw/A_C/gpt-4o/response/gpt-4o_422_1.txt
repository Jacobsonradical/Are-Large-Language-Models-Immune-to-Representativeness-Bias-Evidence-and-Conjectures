Let's break down the information and apply it step-by-step in accordance with Bayes' rule.

Firstly, we need to define our prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the hypothetical probability that Adam was enrolled in each field. Since we don't have specific prior information, we'll assume a relatively equal initial distribution that is reasonable based on common graduate fields.

Secondly, we need to determine \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of the evidence (personality sketch) given enrollment in each field, and \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of the evidence given enrollment in any other field.

Finally, we apply Bayes' rule to determine \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability of each field given the evidence.

For simplicity, let's use the following rough estimations:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science (AG)**
    - \( P(H_{AG}) \): Let's assume a moderate prior probability, say 0.1 (10%).
    - \( P(E|H_{AG}) \): Given Adam's interests and personality, it seems highly likely he would be in this field, let's assume 0.8.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{AG}) \): This is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in any field other than agricultural and veterinary science. Let's conservatively estimate it around 0.2.

2. **Computer science (CS)**
    - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Let's assume a moderate prior probability as well, say 0.1 (10%).
    - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Given Adam's personality and interests, it's less likely he would be in computer science, but it's still possible due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills, let's assume 0.3.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): This is again the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in any field other than computer science. Let’s conservatively estimate it around 0.7.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant, calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AG}) \cdot P(H_{AG}) + P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AG}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AG}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \]

For simplification, let’s only consider \( H_{AG} \) and \( H_{CS} \):

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{AG}) \cdot P(H_{AG}) + P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \]

Now let's calculate:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{AG}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AG}) \cdot P(H_{AG})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AG}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{(0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.1)} \]
\[ P(H_{AG}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.03} \]
\[ P(H_{AG}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.11} \]
\[ P(H_{AG}|E) \approx 0.727 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{(0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.1)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.08 + 0.03} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.11} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.273 \]

Thus, our results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.727,
  "computer science": 0.273
}
```

This calculation suggests Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science, given his personality sketch.
