To compute the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch (E) using Bayes' rule, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Define prior probabilities \( P(H) \)** - This is our initial assumption about the likelihood of Adam being in each field before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Assess likelihood \( P(E|H) \)** - This is the probability that the personality sketch matches the profile of someone in each field.
3. **Assess the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)** - This is the probability that the personality sketch matches the profile of someone not in each specified field.
4. **Compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \)** using Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
   - We calculate \( P(E) \) as: \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

Assuming simplicity, let's assign some estimated values:

**Computer Science**
1. Prior probability \( P(H) \): Let's assume a reasonable ratio for graduate student fields, say 0.2.
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality, curiosity about nature, empathy, and intelligence, the likelihood of him fitting into computer science is moderate, say 0.3.
3. Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch matching someone not in computer science might be higher since the sketch suggests non-technical interests, say 0.7.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
1. Prior probability \( P(H) \): Let's assume a lower ratio based on typical graduate enrollment fields, say 0.1.
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals, the likelihood of him fitting into agricultural and veterinary science is high, say 0.7.
3. Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch matching someone not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower, say 0.4.

Performing the calculations for \( P(H|E) \):

**Computer Science:**
1. \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
   - \( P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8 \)
   - \( P(E) = 0.06 + 0.56 = 0.62 \)

2. \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.62} \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \approx 0.097 \)

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
1. \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
   - \( P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 \)
   - \( P(E) = 0.07 + 0.36 = 0.43 \)

2. \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.43} \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.43} \approx 0.163 \)

Thus, the posterior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.097,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.163
}
```

These values are estimates to illustrate the methodology rather than precise values.
