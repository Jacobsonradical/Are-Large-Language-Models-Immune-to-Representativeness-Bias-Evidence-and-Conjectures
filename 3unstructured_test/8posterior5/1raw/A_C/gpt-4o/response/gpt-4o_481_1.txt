To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field of study given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For this particular problem, we need to estimate:
1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability of Adam being in a specific field (without knowing his personality).
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is in the specific field \(H\).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is not in the specific field \(H\).
4. \( P(E) \) - The overall probability of the personality sketch \(E\). This can be derived using the law of total probability.

Let's begin estimating these probabilities for each field.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H):** Let's assume that the likelihood of Adam being in this field before knowing his personality is somewhat low but not negligible. Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.05\) (5%).
  
- **P(E|H):** Given the personality sketch, it seems very likely that someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Science has such traits. Let's give this a high probability, say \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).

- **P(E|\neg H):** Without being in this field, the probability of having his personality traits might be lower but not rare. Let's estimate it around \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

### 2. Computer Science

- **P(H):** Computer Science is a very common graduate field, so let's assume a higher initial probability. Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.15\) (15%).

- **P(E|H):** Given the personality sketch, these traits are moderately common in Computer Science students, especially curiosity, intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work. Let's give this a moderate probability, say \(P(E|H) = 0.5\).

- **P(E|\neg H):** Without being in this field, the probability of exhibiting these traits is fairly consistent as these traits are general. Let's estimate it as \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.4\).

#### Bayes' Rule Calculation

To calculate \( P(H|E) \), we need \( P(E) \), which can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\(H_{AV}\)):

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325 \]

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \approx 0.123 \]

For Computer Science (\(H_{CS}\)):

\[ P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.15 + 0.4 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.075 + 0.34 = 0.415 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.15}{0.415} = \frac{0.075}{0.415} \approx 0.181 \]

Now, combining these values:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123,
  "computer science": 0.181
}

These values indicate the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of these fields given his personality traits. Remember, these probabilities are based on estimates and assumptions; actual values might differ with more precise data.
