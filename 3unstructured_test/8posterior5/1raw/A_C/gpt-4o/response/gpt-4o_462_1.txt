To apply Bayesian reasoning to determine how likely Adam is enrolled in a specific field based on his personality sketch, we need to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields and we're comparing the likelihoods, we can focus on the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \). We'll estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability that the personality sketch \(E\) matches if Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that the personality sketch \(E\) matches if Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.

Here are the steps for each field:

### Computer Science

1. \(P(H)\): Estimate the prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science. Let's say it's relatively common, so around 0.2.
2. \(P(E|H)\): Given the personality traits (curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills), it seems somewhat likely he is in computer science. Let's estimate 0.4.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): We need to consider how common these personality traits are in other fields. Given Adam's traits, they are quite broad and could fit well into many fields. Suppose around 0.3.

Using Bayes' formula without denominators for simplicity:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. \(P(H)\): Estimate the prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. It is less common, so around 0.05.
2. \(P(E|H)\): Given the personality traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals), it seems quite likely Adam could be in this field. Letâ€™s estimate 0.6.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): Considering how common these personality traits are in other fields, they align particularly well with this one. Suppose around 0.1.

Using Bayes' formula without denominators for simplicity:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.6 * 0.05 = 0.03 \]

Now, normalizing these numbers relative to each other (since \(P(E)\) is same for all):
For computer science:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.03} \approx 0.727 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.03}{0.08 + 0.03} \approx 0.273 \]

So, the values we get are:

{
  "computer science": 0.727,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.273
}
