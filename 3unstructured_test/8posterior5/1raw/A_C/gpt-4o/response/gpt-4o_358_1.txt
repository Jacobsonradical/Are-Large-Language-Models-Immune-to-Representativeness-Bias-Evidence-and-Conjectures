To compute the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science based on the personality sketch \( E \) provided, we will use Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the following:

1. \( P(H) \) — The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) — The likelihood of observing the personality traits given he is enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) — The likelihood of observing the personality traits given he is not enrolled in that particular field.

Since we don't have specific data, we will use reasonable estimates based on general knowledge and the information provided.

### Estimations:

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**

   - \( P(\text{computer science}) \): Let's assume that the probability of a graduate student being in computer science is fairly high, as it is a common field. We can estimate this as \( 0.2 \).
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): Let's assume this field is less common than computer science. We can estimate this as \( 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**

   - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \): While possible, it's less typical for a computer science student to have a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy as described. We can estimate this as \( 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): The described personality aligns well with this field, so we estimate this as \( 0.7 \).

3. **Other Likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \)**

   It's challenging to estimate \( P(E) \) directly, so we approximate \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:

   \[
   P(E) = P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\text{other fields}) \cdot P(\text{other fields})
   \]

   Given that there are many other possible fields Adam could be studying, let's rough-estimate \( P(E|\text{other fields}) \) as \( 0.2 \) and \( P(\text{other fields}) \) as \( 0.75 \).

   Now, let's calculate:

   - \( P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 = 0.02 + 0.035 + 0.15 = 0.205 \)

### Bayes' Rule Calculation:

1. **For computer science:**

   \[
   P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.205} \approx 0.0976
   \]

2. **For agricultural and veterinary science:**

   \[
   P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.205} \approx 0.1707
   \]

Thus, our results are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.0976,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1707
}
```
