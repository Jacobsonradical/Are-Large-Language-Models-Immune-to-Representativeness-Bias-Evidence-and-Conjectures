To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine prior probabilities \( P(H) \): The initial beliefs about Adam being enrolled in a particular field without considering the personality sketch.
2. Determine \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
3. Determine \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in a particular field.
4. Apply Bayes' theorem: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we will assume \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) across all fields) to be a normalization constant, making sure that our probabilities are in a reasonable range.

Here are the assumptions and computations for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
  Graduate students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science fields in the U.S. are relatively fewer than in some other fields, but not exceedingly rare. Assume \( P(H) \) = 0.10.
  
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
  Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals fits very well with agricultural and veterinary science. As he has a strong empathy and love for animals, this field seems extremely plausible. Assume \( P(E|H) \) = 0.9.
  
- **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
  Given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of having the same personality sketch might be lower but not exceedingly low since curiosity about nature and empathy can be present in other fields. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.3.
  
Using Bayes' theorem (ignoring the normalization constant for now),

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### Computer Science

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
  Computer science is a highly popular field among graduate students due to the demand and versatility of the discipline. Assume \( P(H) \) = 0.25.
  
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
  While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, his specific interests in nature and animals are less aligned with the typical focus of computer science. Assume \( P(E|H) \) = 0.2.
  
- **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
  Given that Adam is not in computer science, the probability of observing the same personality sketch could be higher due to other fields fitting better. This sketch would fit other non-computer science fields well. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.4.
  
Using Bayes' theorem (ignoring the normalization constant for now),

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.05 \]

Now compiling the final relative probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.05
}
```

These numbers reflect the relative likelihoods of Adam being enrolled in each of these fields based on the given personality sketch.
