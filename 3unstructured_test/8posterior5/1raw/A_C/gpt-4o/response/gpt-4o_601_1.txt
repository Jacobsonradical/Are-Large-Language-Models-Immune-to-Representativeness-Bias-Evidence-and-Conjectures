To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we assume \( P(E) \) to be a normalization factor that can be simplified out if we are only comparing the fields. Let's address each component:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - **P(H) for agricultural and veterinary science (AVS)**: This prior could be based on the distribution of how many graduate students generally enroll in this field.
   - **P(H) for computer science (CS)**: Similarly, this prior could be based on the commonality of this field among graduate students.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - **P(E|H) for AVS**: The personality sketch of Adam fits well with AVS. Empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for the hard work are strong indicators.
   - **P(E|H) for CS**: While Adam's intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align with CS, his love for nature and animals doesn't strongly indicate this field.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - Proportional to the overall likelihood of such a personality sketch among all graduate fields.

Using Bayes' rule in a proportional manner, we'll estimate these probabilities.

### Estimates:
Let's assume:
- \( P(H) \) for AVS = 0.2 (since fewer students typically enroll in this field).
- \( P(H) \) for CS = 0.3 (more common).

For likelihood \( P(E|H) \), let's assign:
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \) (since Adam's personality aligns well with AVS).
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.5 \) (some alignment but less strong).

The values for the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):
- Assuming moderate alignment for other fields not specified, let's take \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.6 \)
- And for \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.6 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{\sum P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{\sum P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Dividing directly for proportionality without normalizing (as we're comparing):
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.2 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.3 \]

Calculating these:
- \( P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.16 \)
- \( P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.15 \)

These provide a relative idea of the field likelihood.

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```

This means Adam is slightly more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science based on the given personality sketch.
