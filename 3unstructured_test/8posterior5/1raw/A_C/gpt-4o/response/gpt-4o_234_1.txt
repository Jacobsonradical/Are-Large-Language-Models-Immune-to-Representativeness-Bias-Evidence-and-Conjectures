To start the evaluation using Bayes' rule, we first need to understand the probabilities:

1. **P(H)** - The prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
2. **P(E|H)** - The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field.
3. **P(E|¬H)** - The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field.

**Bayes' Rule**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and considering only relative probabilities, we'll use the ratio of likelihoods for comparison.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Assumptions:
- **P(H)**: It’s reasonable to assume that the prior probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate among various fields.
  - Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

- **P(E|H)**: Adam's characteristics align very well with this field because of his genuine curiosity about nature and his love for animals.
  - Let’s assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).

- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of having such characteristics in fields that are not related to agricultural and veterinary science is considerably lower.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|¬H) \approx 0.2 \).

#### Calculation:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### Computer Science

#### Assumptions:
- **P(H)**: It's reasonable to assume the prior probability of being in computer science is also moderate in comparison to various fields.
  - Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

- **P(E|H)**: Adam's characteristics somewhat align with this field because of his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, but it is not a perfect fit compared to the agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Let’s assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \).

- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of having such characteristics in non-computer science fields is substantial but slightly lower.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|¬H) \approx 0.3 \).

#### Calculation:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04 \]

### Result

Based on the relative likelihoods, the results are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.04
}
