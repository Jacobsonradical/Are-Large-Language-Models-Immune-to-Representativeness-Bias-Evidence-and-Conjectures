To apply Bayes' rule to determine \( P(H|E) \) for Adam considering his personality sketch and the given fields of study, we need to judge the probabilities as follows:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field \( H \) without considering his personality sketch.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the field \( H \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

Assumptions:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and appreciation for hard work fit well with this field.
  
**Estimations:**
- \( P(H) \): The likelihood of any graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate.
- \( P(E|H) \): Considering his personality traits, it is quite high.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): It’s reasonably lower compared to \( P(E|H) \).

**Numeric Values:**
- \( P(H) = 0.10 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \)

### 2. Computer Science

Assumptions:
- Adam’s high intelligence and enjoyment in solving puzzles fit well with computer science, but his love for nature and animals does not align closely.

**Estimations:**
- \( P(H) \): The likelihood of any graduate student being in computer science is relatively high.
- \( P(E|H) \): While his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills fit well, the rest of his traits are not directly related, so it’s moderate.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): It remains fairly high because the personality sketch could fit other fields.

**Numeric Values:**
- \( P(H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.60 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \)

### Calculations

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[
P(E) = (0.70 \cdot 0.10) + (0.20 \cdot 0.90) = 0.07 + 0.18 = 0.25
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.10}{0.25} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28
\]

**Computer Science:**
\[
P(E) = (0.60 \cdot 0.20) + (0.30 \cdot 0.80) = 0.12 + 0.24 = 0.36
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.20}{0.36} = \frac{0.12}{0.36} = 0.33
\]

### Final Output

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "computer science": 0.33
}
