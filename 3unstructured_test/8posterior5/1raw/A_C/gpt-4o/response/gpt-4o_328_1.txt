To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we need to follow Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence, given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence, given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

Since the exact values of these probabilities are not provided, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the given information.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Computer Science is a common graduate field in the U.S., so let's assume a moderate prior probability.
   - Assume \( P(H) \approx 0.20 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - While Adam has high intelligence and likes solving puzzles (traits that fit computer science), his love for nature and animals doesn't directly align with typical interests in computer science.
   - Assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.30 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This is less straightforward, but since Adam's personality traits are somewhat uncommon among computer science students, we assume the probability of someone with such traits being in computer science is lower if they are not in that field.
   - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.10 \).

Now, applying Bayes' rule and using an approximation of \( P(E) \):

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.30 \times 0.20}{P(E)} \approx 0.06 / P(E) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science is less common but fits Adam's profile well.
   - Assume \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's personality traits (love for nature and animals, appreciation for hard work) strongly align with this field.
   - Assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.80 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Since these traits are not as common in other fields, we can assume a lower probability.
   - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.05 \).

Now applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.80 \times 0.10}{P(E)} \approx 0.08 / P(E) \]

### Combining results

The combined probability is influenced by the degree to which Adam's personality aligns with each field, scaled by their respective prevalence. Here's what we can estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06 / P(E),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08 / P(E)
}
```

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and applies to both, we can provide some indicative probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.075,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
```

These values are rounded estimates and suggest that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
