To compute the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in "computer science" and "agricultural and veterinary science," we use Bayes' theorem. Here's the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of Adam being in a particular field given his personality traits.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of having these personality traits given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of Adam having these personality traits.

We'll assume some reasonable values for these probabilities based on common sense and the information given in the sketch.

### For Computer Science:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in a computer science program. Let's assume that computer science is a popular field, so we'll set it to \( 0.20 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of having these traits given that Adam is in computer science. Some traits like high intelligence and enjoying puzzles fit well, but a deep love for nature and animals is not that typical. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be \( 0.30 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having these traits given that Adam is not in computer science. This is a bit subjective, but considering the uniqueness of the combination of his traits, we'll set this to be \( 0.10 \).

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, which is likely less popular than computer science. Let's set it to \( 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of having these traits given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. These traits strongly align with this field. So, we'll estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be \( 0.80 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having these traits given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Following the reasoning above, we'll set it to be \( 0.10 \).

### Calculations:

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

To find the normalized probabilities, we need \( P(E) \), which is the same for both, but isn't provided. For this purpose, we'll use the numerators directly to compare:

\[ P(E) \propto 0.06 + 0.04 \]
\[ P(E) \propto 0.10 \]

For normalization, the relevant comparison is to divide by the total \( P(E) \) which implies \( P(E) \) cancels out in the ratio:

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.06}{0.10} = 0.60 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.04}{0.10} = 0.40 \),
}

Final comparison percentages:
