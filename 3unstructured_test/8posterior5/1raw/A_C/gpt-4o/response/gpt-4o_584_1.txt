To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We assume that \( P(E) \) will be consistent for all calculations, hence we will focus on the numerators.

For each field, let's make reasonable assumptions to go through the calculations.

1. **agricultural and veterinary science:**

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this value to be around 0.1 or 10%, a reasonable figure in general terms.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his genuine curiosity about nature and his love for animals, this value should be high, say 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature are somewhat more common in this field than in the general population, let's assume a value of 0.2.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

2. **computer science:**

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science. This is a very popular field, so let's assume this value to be around 0.2 or 20%.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science. Adam's characteristics do not strongly point to computer science, so let's use a lower value, say 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in computer science. Letâ€™s assume this value to be roughly similar to the general population, so 0.7.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Now, without calculating the exact value of \( P(E) \), we can compare these values proportionally.

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

For **computer science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

The value \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, so we can compare the numerators directly.

Based on these calculations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.06
}
```

Please note these assumptions are based on provided data and generic prior probabilities; actual values may vary based on more detailed data or specific context.
