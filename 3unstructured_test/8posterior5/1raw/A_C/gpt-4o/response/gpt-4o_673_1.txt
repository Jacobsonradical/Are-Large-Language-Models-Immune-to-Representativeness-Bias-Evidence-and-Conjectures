To compute the probabilities we need, let's break down each step using Bayes' rule for the fields of computer science and agricultural and veterinary science.

### Bayes' Theorem
Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given the negation of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing evidence \( E \).

### For Computer Science:
1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior Probability):** Assuming equal likelihood among all fields, but noting the high popularity and enrollment in computer science among graduate students leads to the assumption that the probability is higher than average.
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.25 \) (This is an assumption based on typical enrollment statistics).

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood):** Examining Adam's personality traits:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants fits better with fields that involve them (like agricultural science).
   - Solving puzzles and high intelligence are good fits, but empathy and a warm heart are not necessarily characteristic traits for the majority in this field.
   - A plausible but not strong fit: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of evidence given not H):** Considering many graduate programs but noting that fields like agricultural and veterinary science better match his profile:
   - Greater likelihood in other fields, especially agricultural sciences.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \) .

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior Probability):** Assuming moderate enrollment, so slightly lower than more popular fields like computer science:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood):** Matches Adam's characteristics very well:
   - Strong fit for curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood of evidence given not H):** 
   - Considering Adam's traits, which are quite specific, the likelihood fits less well with other, non-related fields.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

### Applying Bayesâ€™ Rule:
#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H))} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.3 \cdot 0.25 + 0.7 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.075}{0.525} \approx 0.143 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H))} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25 \]

### Final Results:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.143,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25
}
