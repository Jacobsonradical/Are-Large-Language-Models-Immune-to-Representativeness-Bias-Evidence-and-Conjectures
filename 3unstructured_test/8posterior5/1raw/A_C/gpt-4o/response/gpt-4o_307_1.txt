Let's work through the problem using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given that we're considering two fields:
1. Computer Science
2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

Here's the evaluation:

1. **Computer Science (H = Adam was enrolled in Computer Science)**

### Bayesian Components:
- **P(H):** What is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science? 
  Graduate programs in Computer Science are quite common and have a high enrollment rate. For simplicity, let's assume a reasonable value: 
  \[
  P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2
  \]

- **P(E|H):** What is the probability of observing the given personality sketch if Adam is in Computer Science? 
  Considering Adam's quiet nature and high intelligence, as well as his skill in abstract concepts and solving puzzles, these traits match reasonably well with a Computer Science profile:
  \[
  P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.6
  \]

- **P(E|\neg H):** What is the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not in Computer Science? 
  Adam's appreciation for nature and empathy may not be strongly associated with typical Computer Science students, so:
  \[
  P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3
  \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H = Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**

### Bayesian Components:
- **P(H):** What is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science? 
  This field is less common than Computer Science but matches particularly well with Adam's interests:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.1
  \]

- **P(E|H):** What is the probability of observing the given personality sketch if Adam is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science? 
  The personality sketch strongly aligns with someone interested in Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[
  P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.8
  \]

- **P(E|\neg H):** What is the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science? 
  Given that there are numerous fields, and Adamâ€™s personality traits may match other fields as well:
  \[
  P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.3
  \]

### Bayesian Calculations:
Let's compute \(P(E)\) as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{CS}}) - P(H_{\text{AgVet}}))
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.2 - 0.1))
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.08 + 0.3 \cdot 0.7 = 0.12 + 0.08 + 0.21 = 0.41
\]

Now, compute \(P(H_{\text{CS}} | E)\):

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.41} \approx 0.29
\]

And \(P(H_{\text{AgVet}} | E)\):

\[
P(H_{\text{AgVet}} | E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.41} \approx 0.20
\]

Final Answer:
\[
{
  "computer science": 0.29,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.20
}
\]
