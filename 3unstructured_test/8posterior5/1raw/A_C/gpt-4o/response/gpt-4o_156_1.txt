To compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to apply Bayes' theorem: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we'll evaluate \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being in that field), \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is in that field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is not in that field). Since \( P(E) \) in each case is a normalization constant, we will focus on relative values.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: This depends on the general probability of someone in the graduate student population being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume an average value like 0.1 (10%).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, and strong empathy, it is quite likely he is in this field. Let's assume a higher likelihood like 0.8.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Since these characteristics are not exclusive to agricultural and veterinary sciences and can apply to other fields as well but less likely, let's assign a value of 0.3.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \propto P(E|H)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Computer Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: This depends on the general probability of someone in the graduate student population being enrolled in computer science. Let's assume an average value like 0.2 (20%).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's traits like high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and problem-solving abilities, it's plausible. However, fewer of his traits directly indicate a strong interest in nature (less related to computer science). Let's assume a moderate likelihood like 0.4.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Since the characteristics can fit other technical fields but less directly, let's assign a value of 0.5.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} \propto P(E|H)_{\text{computer science}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{computer science}} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} \propto 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Given these relative computations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
```

This indicates that, based on the given information and the assumptions made, the posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science are relatively equal.
