To apply Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. Estimate the prior probability \(P(H)\) for each hypothesis \(H\).
2. Estimate the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), which is the probability of observing the evidence \(E\) given that hypothesis \(H\) is true.
3. Estimate the likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\), which is the probability of observing the evidence \(E\) given that hypothesis \(H\) is not true.
4. Use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) for each hypothesis.

Let's denote \(H_{\text{CS}}\) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science and \(H_{\text{AVS}}\) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{\text{CS}})\):**
   - Let's assume a reasonable prior probability that any given graduate student might be in computer science. For simplicity, we'll assume \(P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.20\) (20%).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\):**
   - The evidence \(E\) includes traits like solving puzzles (highly relevant to computer science), intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. However, it also includes traits like a deep love for animals and curiosity about plants, which are less relevant to computer science.
   - Given those characteristics, let's assign a moderate likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.30\) (30%).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})\):**
   - The probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in computer science is tricky. There are many other fields he could be in.
   - Traits like empathy and love for animals might increase this likelihood. For simplicity, let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.70\) (70%).

4. **Posterior Probability \(P(H_{\text{CS}}|E)\):**
   - Applying Bayes' rule:
     \[
     P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}})}
     \]
     \[
     P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{0.30 \cdot 0.20 + 0.70 \cdot 0.80} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.56} = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \approx 0.097
     \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H_{\text{AVS}})\):**
   - Let's assume a reasonable prior probability that any given graduate student might be in agricultural and veterinary science. For simplicity, we'll assume \(P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.10\) (10%).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})\):**
   - The evidence \(E\) includes traits like a deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and appreciation for hard workâ€”all of which are highly relevant to agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given those characteristics, let's assign a high likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.85\) (85%).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}})\):**
   - The probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science might still be relatively high because some of these traits (e.g., empathy, intelligence) are broadly applicable. However, it would be lower than the likelihood for \(H_{\text{AVS}}\).
   - Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.40\) (40%).

4. **Posterior Probability \(P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E)\):**
   - Applying Bayes' rule:
     \[
     P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AVS}})}
     \]
     \[
     P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.85 \cdot 0.10}{0.85 \cdot 0.10 + 0.40 \cdot 0.90} = \frac{0.085}{0.085 + 0.36} = \frac{0.085}{0.445} \approx 0.191
     \]

### Summary

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.097,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.191
}
```

This suggests that based on the provided information, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science.
