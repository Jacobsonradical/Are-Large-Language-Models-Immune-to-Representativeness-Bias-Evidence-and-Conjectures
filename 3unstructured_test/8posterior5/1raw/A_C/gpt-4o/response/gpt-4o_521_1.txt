To apply Bayes' theorem and compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to evaluate the following terms:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in each field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given the personality sketch \( E \).

Let's make reasonable assumptions for each field:

### For Computer Science:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Let's assume 10% of graduate students are in computer science (broad estimation).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability that Adam has this personality sketch given he is in computer science might be lower, say 0.2, because his interests and traits do not strictly align with the typical computer science student profile.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Since \( E \) can apply to many other fields, this might be higher, say 0.3.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Suppose 5% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): The probability that Adam has this personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science is higher, say 0.7, given his interest in nature, plants, and animals.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Since \( E \) can apply to other fields, let's say 0.4 for this.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

However, we skip the exact normalization as we only need relative probabilities:

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

Normalizing these probabilities (while they do not necessarily add up to 1, it still illustrates the relative likelihood):

### Final Result:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.035
}
```

Thus, given the personality sketch \( E \), it is more likely that Adam is in the field of agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science.
