Let's start by evaluating the probabilities for each field of study based on the information provided and then apply Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and understanding of hard work, we can assume a moderate prior probability. Let's assume P(H) = 0.3.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - Adam's qualities align well with this field. Thus, it's reasonable to assign a high probability, say P(E|H) = 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing E given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - While some of Adam's traits are quite general (like high intelligence and empathy), the specific interest in nature and plants is more distinctive. So, we assign a moderate probability, say P(E|¬H) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.7 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) = 0.24 + 0.14 = 0.38 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.38} = \frac{0.24}{0.38} \approx 0.63 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
    - Computer science is a popular field, and his intelligence and problem-solving skills can fit well within it. Let's assume P(H) = 0.4.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is enrolled in computer science.
    - While some qualities like problem-solving are relevant, traits like deep love for animals and nature are less closely related. So, we assign a lower probability, say P(E|H) = 0.3.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing E given that he is not enrolled in computer science.
    - We can't consider E to be peculiar to computer science; hence, P(E|¬H) should be set based on general academic probabilities, say P(E|¬H) = 0.4.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.6 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.4) + (0.4 \cdot 0.6) = 0.12 + 0.24 = 0.36 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.4}{0.36} = \frac{0.12}{0.36} = 0.33 \]

Now let's present the final answer in the required format.
