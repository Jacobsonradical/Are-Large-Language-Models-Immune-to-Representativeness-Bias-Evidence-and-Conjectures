To find the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, I will use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given not H.
- \( P(E) \) is the total evidence probability.

Since we don't have exact numerical values, we will estimate the probabilities based on the given information.

Let's denote the probabilities as follows:
- \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) \) = Prior probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \) = Prior probability that Adam is in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \) = Likelihood that Adam has the given personality traits if he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \) = Likelihood that Adam has the given personality traits if he is in computer science.
- \( P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{agri}})P(H_{\text{agri}}) + P(E|H_{\text{cs}})P(H_{\text{cs}}) + ... \) = Total evidence probability, accounting for other fields.

Let's make some reasonable estimates:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Given there are many possible graduate fields, we might assume some general prior probabilities are roughly equal among many fields. Let’s assume very roughly:
   - \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.05 \)
   - \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.05 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Based on Adam's personality sketch:
   - He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, which fits well with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - He enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts, which are good traits for computer science but the listed traits above are more aligned with agricultural sciences.

   Therefore:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.3 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   Since \( \neg H \) includes all other fields combined, let’s assume reasonably:
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.2 \)

Now we can use Bayes' rule to estimate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \) is a mix of all likelihoods:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}}) + P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + \text{others} \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.05) + \text{others} = 0.055 + \text{others} \]

For simplicity, let's assume the sum of others is significant but secondary:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.2 \]

So we can now estimate as:

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.2} = \frac{0.04}{0.2} = 0.2 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.05}{0.2} = \frac{0.015}{0.2} = 0.075 \]

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.075
}
