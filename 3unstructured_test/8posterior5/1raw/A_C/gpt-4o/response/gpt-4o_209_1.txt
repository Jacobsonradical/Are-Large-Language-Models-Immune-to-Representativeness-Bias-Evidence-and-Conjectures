To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to start by estimating the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E| \neg H) \). Here, \( H \) represents the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field, and \( E \) represents the personality sketch provided.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a constant for all hypotheses, we can use the simplified form:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need to make reasonable assumptions for these probabilities to compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that a random graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it's relatively low, say 5%, or 0.05.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam fits the personality sketch given he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, animals, and empathy, this is relatively high, say 0.8.
3. **P(E| \neg H)**: The probability that Adam fits the personality sketch given he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science. This would be significantly lower, say 0.2, given the specific traits related to the field.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that a random graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume itâ€™s relatively high given the field's popularity, say 20%, or 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam fits the personality sketch given he is studying computer science. Given the focus on solving puzzles and high intelligence, but less so on nature and animals, this is moderate, say 0.4.
3. **P(E| \neg H)**: The probability that Adam fits the personality sketch given he is not studying computer science. This would be slightly less than for agricultural and veterinary science, say 0.3.

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ \text{For agricultural and veterinary science:} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

\[ \text{For computer science:} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]

### Normalizing:
To normalize these probabilities, we'll add them up to create a total probability and then divide each by this total.

\[ \text{Total} = 0.04 + 0.08 = 0.12 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.04}{0.12} \approx 0.333 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.08}{0.12} \approx 0.667 \]

Thus:
