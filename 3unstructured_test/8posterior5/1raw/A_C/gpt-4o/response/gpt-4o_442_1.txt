To apply Bayes' rule in this context, we'll use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam.

We'll individually assess for computer science and agricultural and veterinary science using the steps you mentioned.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H) (Prior probability of being enrolled in computer science):**
   Let’s assume the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science is moderately high due to the popularity of the field. We can roughly estimate it at 0.25.

2. **P(E|H) (Probability of E given H):**
   The traits of Adam (curiosity about nature, love for animals) are less typical for someone in computer science. However, his problem-solving skills and high intelligence are strong indicators for this field. Let's estimate it at 0.3.

3. **P(E|¬H) (Probability of E given not H):**
   If Adam is not in computer science, the probability of having traits such as empathy, animal love, etc., can be considered moderately high. Let's estimate it at 0.7.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E_{cs}) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E_{cs})} \]

To simplify, we use \( P(E_{cs}) \):

\[ P(E_{cs}) = P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|¬H_{cs}) \cdot P(¬H_{cs}) \]
\[ P(E_{cs}) = (0.3 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E_{cs}) = 0.075 + 0.525 \]
\[ P(E_{cs}) = 0.6 \]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.6} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.075}{0.6} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = 0.125 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H) (Prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science):**
   This field is less common than computer science. Let's estimate it at 0.05.

2. **P(E|H) (Probability of E given H):**
   Adam’s traits align very well with this field. Empathy, love for animals, and dedication are highly relevant. Let's estimate it at 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H) (Probability of E given not H):**
   If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of having these traits might be lower. Let's estimate it at 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E_{avs}) = \frac{P(E|H_{avs}) \cdot P(H_{avs})}{P(E_{avs})} \]

To simplify, we use \( P(E_{avs}) \):

\[ P(E_{avs}) = P(E|H_{avs}) \cdot P(H_{avs}) + P(E|¬H_{avs}) \cdot P(¬H_{avs}) \]
\[ P(E_{avs}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E_{avs}) = 0.04 + 0.285 \]
\[ P(E_{avs}) = 0.325 \]

Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H_{avs}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H_{avs}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \]
\[ P(H_{avs}|E) \approx 0.123 \]
