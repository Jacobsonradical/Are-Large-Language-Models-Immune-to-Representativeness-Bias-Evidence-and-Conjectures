To evaluate the probabilities, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify Prior Probabilities (P(H))**: This represents the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field without any other information.
2. **Conditional Probabilities (P(E|H) and P(E|¬H))**: This represents how likely the personality sketch (E) is given that Adam is enrolled or not enrolled in each field.
3. **Apply Bayes' Rule**: Compute the posterior probability P(H|E).

### Definitions:
- P(H): Prior probability of Adam being in a specific graduate field.
- P(E|H): Likelihood of E given H (i.e., the probability of the personality sketch given the field).
- P(E|¬H): Likelihood of E given ¬H (i.e., the probability of the personality sketch given he is not in that field).

### Prior Probabilities (Assumed Based on General Prevalence):
Since it's not specified, we can assume some rough approximations for the sake of calculation:
- P(H_agriculture): 0.1 (Assume 10% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science)
- P(H_computer_science): 0.2 (Assume 20% of graduate students are in computer science)

### Conditional Probabilities:
- P(E|H_agriculture): Based on Adam's strong connection with nature, animals, and plants, the likelihood that his personality fits someone in agricultural and veterinary science is high. Let's assume 0.8.
- P(E|¬H_agriculture): If not in agriculture, it's less likely but still possible, say 0.1.

- P(E|H_computer_science): Some aspects of Adam's personality (solving puzzles, high intelligence) align with computer science, but less so than agriculture. Let's assume 0.4.
- P(E|¬H_computer_science): If not in computer science, it's less likely but still possible, say 0.3.

### Applying Bayes' Rule:
To compute P(H|E), we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing fields, we can consider the relative likelihoods:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Calculations:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

- **Computer Science**:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Given the proportional values, both fields have equal posterior probabilities based on the given prior and conditional probabilities.

### Result:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
```

These equal values suggest that based on the given data and assumptions, Adam is equally likely to be enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science.
