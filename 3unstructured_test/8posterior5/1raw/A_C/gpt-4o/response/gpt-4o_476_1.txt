Sure! Here is my evaluation based on the personality sketch provided using Bayes' rule:

### For Computer Science (H1)
- **P(H1)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Let's assume a generic prior for computer science graduate students, say 0.15.
- **P(E|H1)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is a computer science student. Since Adam is described as having strong empathy and deep love for animals, qualities that might not be directly related to computer science, I'll estimate P(E|H1) as relatively low, say 0.05.
- **P(E|¬H1)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not a computer science student. Taking into account the broad range of other fields that might better correlate with Adam’s interests, I'll estimate this as 0.15.
- **Applying Bayes' Rule**:
  
  P(H1|E) = (P(E|H1) * P(H1)) / [(P(E|H1) * P(H1)) + (P(E|¬H1) * P(¬H1))]

  P(H1|E) = (0.05 * 0.15) / [(0.05 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85)]

  P(H1|E) = 0.0075 / (0.0075 + 0.1275)

  P(H1|E) ≈ 0.055

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)
- **P(H2)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this was less common as a specialization, say 0.10.
- **P(E|H2)**: Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, the probability of observing his personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science is very high. I'll estimate this as 0.7.
- **P(E|¬H2)**: Similar to above, taking into account the broad range of other fields that might correlate less well with Adam's interests, estimate this as 0.1.
- **Applying Bayes' Rule**:

  P(H2|E) = (P(E|H2) * P(H2)) / [(P(E|H2) * P(H2)) + (P(E|¬H2) * P(¬H2))]

  P(H2|E) = (0.7 * 0.10) / [(0.7 * 0.10) + (0.1 * 0.90)]

  P(H2|E) = 0.07 / (0.07 + 0.09)

  P(H2|E) ≈ 0.438

Therefore, the probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.055,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.438
}
