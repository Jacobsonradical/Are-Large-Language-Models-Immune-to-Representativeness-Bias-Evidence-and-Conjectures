To compute P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to judge the values for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H). Let's break this down for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H_AG):** This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume:
   - P(H_AG) could be reasonably estimated as a common but not overwhelmingly popular field among graduate students, say 0.05.

2. **P(E|H_AG):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch E given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science:
   - Given Adam's passion for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, P(E|H_AG) is likely to be very high, say 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H_AG):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch E given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science:
   - Since there are other fields where such a personality might apply, but perhaps not as strongly, we might estimate this to be moderate, say 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{AG}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AG}) \cdot P(H_{AG})}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AG}) \cdot P(H_{AG}) + P(E|¬H_{AG}) \cdot P(¬H_{AG}) \]

So,

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325 \]

Thus:

\[ P(H_{AG}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} \approx 0.123 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H_CS):** This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume:
   - P(H_CS) could be reasonably estimated as a popular field among graduate students, say 0.2.

2. **P(E|H_CS):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch E given that he is in computer science:
   - Given Adam’s interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, but less of an emphasis on nature and plants, P(E|H_CS) might be moderate, say 0.4.

3. **P(E|¬H_CS):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch E given that he is not in computer science:
   - Since there are other fields where such a personality might apply, we might estimate this to be perhaps a bit higher given the diverse interests Adam has, say 0.35.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|¬H_{CS}) \cdot P(¬H_{CS}) \]

So,

\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.35 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.28 = 0.36 \]

Thus:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.36} \approx 0.222 \]

Here is the output in the specified format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123,
  "computer science": 0.222
