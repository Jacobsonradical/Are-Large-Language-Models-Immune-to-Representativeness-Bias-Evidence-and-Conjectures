To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to estimate the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Following this, Bayes' theorem \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \) can be applied. 

For simplicity, we'll assume \( P(E) \) remains constant across different fields while computing relative probabilities. 

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- Prior probability \( P(H) \): Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, it seems likely that he might choose this area, so let's estimate this to be reasonably high. We'll consider \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Given this is highly aligned with his interests (nature, plants, animals), intelligence, and empathy, we can consider this probability very high. So, \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch fitting someone not in this field might be lower. (Since it is not particularly aligned to other random fields). Let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Let’s compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.18}{P(E)} \]

**Computer Science**:
- Prior probability \( P(H) \): Without more specific data, this prior may be more general. As we consider computer science to be a common field of study, we can set this to be moderate. We'll use \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which makes computer science a reasonable fit but not perfect for his complete profile, so let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam’s characteristics fitting those not in computer science might still be relatively high as his traits aren't uncommon in many other fields. Let's use \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Let’s compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.075}{P(E)} \]

Combining the data:
\[
\text{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{P(E)}",
  "computer science": "P(H|E) = \frac{0.075}{P(E)}"
}
\]
For actual values between 0 and 1, we need the denominator \( P(E) \), but as we're focused on relative probabilities:
\[
\text{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.18",
  "computer science": "0.075"
}
\]
Thus:
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18,
  "computer science": 0.075
}
