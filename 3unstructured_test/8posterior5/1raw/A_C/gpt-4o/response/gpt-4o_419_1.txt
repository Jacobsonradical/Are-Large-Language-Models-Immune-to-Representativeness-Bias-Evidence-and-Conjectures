We'll use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in each specific field given his personality sketch. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are comparing two specific fields, \( P(E) \) can be treated as a normalization constant and does not need to be explicitly calculated for comparison purposes.

Here are the steps:

1. **Assess \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field. Generally, this can be approximated based on the popularity of graduate fields. Let’s assume both fields are equally likely without further information:
   - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(H_{\text{computer}}) = 0.5 \)

2. **Assess \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in a specific field.
   - For **agricultural and veterinary science**, Adam’s curiosity about nature and various plants, empathy, and love for animals are strong indications. Hence, \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \) would be relatively high.
   - For **computer science**, while his intelligence and problem-solving skills fit well, his love for animals and plants is less relevant. Hence, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer}}) \) would be lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Assess \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the specified field. For practical purposes and without detailed data, we can assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is similar across unspecified fields but not greatly favored in any specific one.

Let’s estimate values:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.8 \) (highly likely given his interests and empathy)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.2 \) (less likely outside this field)

### Computer Science
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer}}) = 0.4 \) (moderately likely given his problem-solving skills but less relevance to animals and nature)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer}}) = 0.6 \) (personality sketch less fitting for hard sciences like computer science)

Using these estimates to apply Bayes’ Theorem conceptually:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{computer}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{computer}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer}}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.5 = 0.2 \]

Now, normalizing by the evidence (denominator constant) for comparison:

Without the full normalization process, the **relative probabilities** are:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
\]

Thus, based on the personality sketch given, Adam is relatively more likely to be enrolled in **agricultural and veterinary science** compared to **computer science**.
