First, let's analyze the information given:
1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals.
2. Adam is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
3. Adam appreciates hard work and dedication.
4. Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.

Now, we evaluate the hypotheses:

**Computer Science:**
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he's enrolled in computer science.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he's not enrolled in computer science.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he's enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he's not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

**For Computer Science:**

- **P(H)**: Since computer science is a popular field, let's assume P(H) = 0.25 (25%).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals), let's say P(E|H) = 0.1 (10%), as these traits are less specific to a computer science student.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam's traits would exist in a student in any field other than computer science. Let's estimate this to be P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 0.75 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.3 \cdot 0.75 = 0.025 + 0.225 = 0.25 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.25} = 0.1 \]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

- **P(H)**: Assuming this field is less common than computer science but more aligned with Adam's traits, let's say P(H) = 0.15 (15%).
- **P(E|H)**: Since Adamâ€™s traits align strongly with this field, let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.6 (60%).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam's traits exist in any field other than agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this to be P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 0.85 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.09 + 0.17 = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{0.26} \approx 0.346 \]

Putting it all together:

{
  "computer science": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.346"
}
