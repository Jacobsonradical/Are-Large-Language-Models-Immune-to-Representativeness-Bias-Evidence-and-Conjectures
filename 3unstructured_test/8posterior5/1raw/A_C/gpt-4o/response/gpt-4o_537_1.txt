To apply Bayes' Rule and compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch E, we need to start with prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the probabilities of E given not-H \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's define the prior probabilities:

- \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.25 \) (assuming a reasonable proportion of graduate students in this field)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.10 \) (assuming fewer students compared to computer science)

Next, we judge the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.3 \) (since curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving align but may not specifically include nature and animals)
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.8 \) (since this field closely aligns with Adam’s interest in nature, plants, and animals)

For \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood of E given any other field not H):

Assuming there are many other potential fields but they collectively may not align well with Adam’s traits, we can assume:

- \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.3 \)

Finally, applying Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed from:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

For computer science:
\[
P(E)_{\text{computer science}} = (0.3 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) = 0.075 + 0.075 = 0.15
\]
\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.25}{0.15} = \frac{0.075}{0.15} = 0.5
\]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[
P(E)_{\text{agri and vet science}} = (0.8 \times 0.10) + (0.3 \times 0.90) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35
\]
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.10}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229
\]

Thus, the Bayes' Rule application yields the following probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229
}
