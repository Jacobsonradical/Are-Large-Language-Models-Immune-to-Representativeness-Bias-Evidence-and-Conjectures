To apply Bayes' rule effectively, we'll first outline the given probabilities and make educated assumptions based on the personality sketch provided. Bayes' rule can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that specific field.
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the prior probability of Adam not being in that specific field.

**Assumptions:**
1. We're assuming that based on the personality sketch, Adam's traits such as love for nature, empathy, animals, and solving puzzles are more aligned with fields that involve biology or natural sciences rather than purely technical fields like computer science.
2. The priors \(P(H)\) and \(P(\neg H)\) are not explicitly given, so we will use general assumptions about student distributions in these fields in the U.S. graduate programs.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H):** Assuming that computer science is a common graduate field, let's set \(P(H)\) to 0.2 (20%).
2. **P(E|H):** Given Adam's personality traits, the probability of observing such a personality sketch in computer science might be lower. Let's set \(P(E|H)\) to 0.1.
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch in any field other than computer science should be relatively higher due to his nature-oriented and empathetic traits. Let's set \(P(E|\neg H)\) to 0.3.

Using these values:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H):** Assuming that agricultural and veterinary science might be a less common field but aligned with Adam's traits, let's set \(P(H)\) to 0.1 (10%).
2. **P(E|H):** Given Adam's love for nature and animals, the probability of this personality sketch fitting in agricultural and veterinary science is high. Let's set \(P(E|H)\) to 0.7.
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch in any field other than agricultural and veterinary science should be relatively lower. Let's set \(P(E|\neg H)\) to 0.2.

Using these values:
\[ P(H|E)_{Agri} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.7 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28 \]

So the computed probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28
}
