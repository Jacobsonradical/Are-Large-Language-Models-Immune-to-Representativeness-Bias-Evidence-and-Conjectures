To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to evaluate the following probabilities:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the evidence (personality sketch E) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the evidence (personality sketch E) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \(P(H|E)\): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given the evidence.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

For the purposes of calculating \(P(H|E)\), we will focus on comparing the relative likelihood of each hypothesis given the personality sketch:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Assuming all fields are equally likely, let's estimate \(P(H) = 0.1\). This is quite an arbitrary estimate considering the large number of fields, but it keeps the math simple. Agricultural and veterinary science is not the most common graduate field, but itâ€™s reasonably well-established.

2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy), these align very well with someone studying in the agricultural and veterinary science field. Let's estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science can be lower. Many fields would not directly align with these traits. Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

We can assume that \(P(E)\) remains constant while comparing different fields, hence we can simplify to:
\[P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08\]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Again, we'll assume \(P(H) = 0.1\) for simplicity.

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits like high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles are a good fit for computer science. However, other traits such as love for animals and nature curiosity are less indicative. Let's estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.4\).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of E given that Adam is not in computer science can be estimated similarly to above at \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04\]
