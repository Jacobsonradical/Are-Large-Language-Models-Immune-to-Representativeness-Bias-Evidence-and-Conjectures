To solve for the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's how we apply this to both computer science and agricultural and veterinary science fields:

### Computer Science

1. \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume prior likelihood based on common graduate fields.
   - Assume a general ballpark figure for students enrolled in computer science at graduate level: \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \).
   
2. \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in computer science.
   - Considering aspects of high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, this is relatively high, but nature and animals are less likely correlated.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability of the personality sketch given not being enrolled in computer science.
   - Broad range of other fields, especially ones like agricultural science, can typically match his personality more closely.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Assume fewer students compared to computer science, but more aligned with personality traits seen.
   - Assume: \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.1 \).

2. \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, plants, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, this is very high.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The probability of the personality sketch given not being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Less alignment with other less similar fields.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.3 \).

Now, we compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule:

### Computer Science
\[ 
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} 
\]
We don't know \( P(E) \), but for the sake of comparison, it can be examined as inverse proportional.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ 
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} 
\]

### Comparative estimation (Normalized):
1. For \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \):
\[ 
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 
\]

2. For \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \):
\[ 
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 
\]

Normalization:
\[ 
P(H|\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.08} = 0.43 
\]

\[ 
P(H|\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.06 + 0.08} = 0.57 
\]

So the resulting proportions that Adam, based on his personality and priors, may be enrolled in:

{
  "computer science": "0.43",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.57"
}
