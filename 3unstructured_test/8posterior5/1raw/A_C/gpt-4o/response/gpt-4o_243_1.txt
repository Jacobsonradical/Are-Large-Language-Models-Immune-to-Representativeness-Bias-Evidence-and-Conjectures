To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to evaluate and calculate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in each field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field given the personality sketch \( E \).

For the fields of "agricultural and veterinary science" and "computer science":

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H_{\text{ag\_vet}}) \)**
   - Let us consider that Adam's enrollment in this field is moderate, say around 10%. So, \( P(H_{\text{ag\_vet}}) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{\text{ag\_vet}}) \)**
   - Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, it is quite likely he would fit into this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{ag\_vet}}) = 0.8 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag\_vet}}) \)**
   - If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of observing \( E \) would still be moderate but less than if he were in the field. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag\_vet}}) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{ag\_vet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag\_vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag\_vet}})}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{ag\_vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag\_vet}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag\_vet}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{ag\_vet}}) \).

So, 
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

Now,
\[ P(H_{\text{ag\_vet}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \)**
   - Let us consider the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science to be moderate, say around 10% just for the sake of comparison. So, \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \)**
   - Given Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, it is fairly likely he fits into this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.6 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \)**
   - If Adam is not in computer science, the probability of observing \( E \) would be moderate. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \).

So,
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.06 + 0.27 = 0.33 \]

Now,
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.33} = \frac{0.06}{0.33} \approx 0.182 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "computer science": 0.182
}

These values reflect the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each respective field given his personality sketch.
