To evaluate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam is enrolled in each respective field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we need rough estimates of the probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field \( H \).

Let's proceed with our estimates.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that any random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This could be relatively low compared to some other fields.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \)
  
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that a student in agricultural and veterinary science would have the personality traits described. This seems high since his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work aligns well.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)
  
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood that a student not in agricultural and veterinary science would have the same traits. These traits are common but not overwhelmingly so in other disciplines.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{(0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95)} \approx \frac{0.035}{0.215} \approx 0.1628 \]

### Computer Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that any random graduate student is enrolled in computer science. This field is quite popular.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \)
  
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that a student in computer science would have the personality traits described. Some traits like problem-solving align well, but not all directly.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)
  
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood that a student not in computer science would have the same traits. We considered this above to be reflective of general but not specific fit.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{(0.3 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85)} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.215} \approx 0.2093 \]

Final computed probabilities given the personality sketch \( E \):
