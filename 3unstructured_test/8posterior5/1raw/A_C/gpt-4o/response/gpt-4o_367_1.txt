To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) given a personality sketch \( E \) of Adam for each field, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, I'll estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) first.

### Computer Science
- **\[ P(H) \]**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given that computer science is a relatively popular graduate field in the U.S., let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **\[ P(E|H) \]**: Probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, it's somewhat likely but not highly correlated with nature and animals. So, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- **\[ P(E|\neg H) \]**: Probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science. Given that the traits are very general and could apply to many other fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\[ P(H) \]**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field might be less popular compared to computer science, but Adam's interests align more closely with this field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- **\[ P(E|H) \]**: Probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This seems highly likely since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- **\[ P(E|\neg H) \]**: Probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the specificity of his traits towards nature, it's less likely but not impossible. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \) and \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \):

For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.45 = 0.48 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.48} = \frac{0.03}{0.48} \approx 0.0625 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.4 \cdot 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.38 = 0.425 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.425} = \frac{0.045}{0.425} \approx 0.1059 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.0625,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1059
}
