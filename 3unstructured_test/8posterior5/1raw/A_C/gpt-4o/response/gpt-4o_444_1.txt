To estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science in 2021, given his personality sketch \(E\), we need to apply Bayes’ rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here are the steps for each field:

### Computer Science
#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Given that computer science is quite a common field, let's assume the prior probability of a graduate student picking computer science is 20%. So \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Computer science students might have high intelligence and like solving puzzles, so there’s a moderate likelihood that someone with Adam's traits could be in computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature is less aligned. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

#### Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
Given how common graduate fields are, those traits are not exclusive to computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.01 \).

#### Applying Bayes' Rule for Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.1 * 0.2}{(0.1 * 0.2) + (0.01 * 0.8)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Let's assume the prior probability for a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science is lower, maybe 5%. So \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
The described characteristics strongly align with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).

#### Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
For traits not aligned with non-agricultural fields, let's assume this is quite low. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.01 \).

#### Applying Bayes' Rule for Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.6 * 0.05}{(0.6 * 0.05) + (0.01 * 0.95)} \]

Now calculate the results.

### Computer Science Calculation
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.1 * 0.2}{(0.1 * 0.2) + (0.01 * 0.8)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.008} = \frac{0.02}{0.028} \approx 0.714 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science Calculation
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.6 * 0.05}{(0.6 * 0.05) + (0.01 * 0.95)} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.0095} = \frac{0.03}{0.0395} \approx 0.759 \]

Therefore, the probability estimates are:

  "computer science": 0.714,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.759
