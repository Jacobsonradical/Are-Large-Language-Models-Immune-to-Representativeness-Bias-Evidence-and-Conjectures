Certainly! I'll evaluate the likelihoods as requested using Bayes' rule, based on the given information about Adam's personality and field of study.

### Definitions
- **E:** Personality sketch of Adam.
- **H (Computer Science):** Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
- **H (Agricultural and Veterinary Science):** Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)
- **P(H | Computer Science):** Given the prevalence of students in this field.
- **P(H | Agricultural and Veterinary Science):** Given the prevalence of students in this field.

Without specific prevalence data, I'll assume a rough equality in prior probability for simplicity:

\[
P(H_{CS}) = 0.5 \quad \text{(assuming)}
\]
\[
P(H_{AgVet}) = 0.5 \quad \text{(assuming)}
\]

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)
- **P(E | H for Computer Science):** Lower likelihood because computer science students may not generally have a high interest in nature and animals.
- **P(E | H for Agricultural and Veterinary Science):** High likelihood given the strong alignment with Adam's interest in plants, animals, empathy, and appreciation of hard work.

I will assign some arbitrary values to represent these likelihoods based on the personality sketch:

\[
P(E | H_{CS}) = 0.2
\]
\[
P(E | H_{AgVet}) = 0.8
\]

### Complement Likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \)
These are a bit trickier but necessary for the calculation:

- **P(E | \neg H for Computer Science):** Higher, as many fields can align with the given personality traits.
- **P(E | \neg H for Agricultural and Veterinary Science):** Lower because fewer fields strongly align with Adam's described personality.

I'll assign some rough estimates for these:

\[
P(E | \neg H_{CS}) = 0.6
\]
\[
P(E | \neg H_{AgVet}) = 0.4
\]

### Bayes' Rule
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{AgVet}) \cdot P(H_{AgVet}) \):

\[
P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.5) + (0.8 \cdot 0.5) = 0.5
\]

#### For Computer Science
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.2
\]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[
P(H_{AgVet}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AgVet}) \cdot P(H_{AgVet})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
\}
\]

These estimates reflect that Adam is significantly more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science given his personality sketch.
