To compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to judge the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and the complement likelihoods \(P(E|\neg H)\). Here's the process to compute for both computer science and agricultural and veterinary science.

### Computer Science

**P(H)**:
Let’s start with estimating the prior probability that a random graduate student is studying computer science. Let's denote this as \(P(H)\).
Given the popularity of computer science as a field, let’s assume:
\[P(H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.2\]

**P(E|H)**:
Next, we evaluate how well the personality traits fit a typical computer science student:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants: Medium relevance.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: High relevance.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals: Low to medium relevance.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: High relevance.

Let's assume:
\[P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.3\]

**P(E|\neg H)**:
This is the probability of observing these traits given that Adam is not in computer science. Since these traits could fit many other fields as well, let's assume:
\[P(E|\neg H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.1\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H)**:
Assume the prior probability that a random graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science:
\[P(H)_{\text{AgVet}} = 0.05\]

**P(E|H)**:
Evaluate how well the traits fit a typical agricultural and veterinary science student:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants: High relevance.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Medium relevance.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals: High relevance.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Medium to High relevance.

Let's assume:
\[P(E|H)_{\text{AgVet}} = 0.7\]

**P(E|\neg H)**:
This is the probability of observing these traits given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that these traits are less common in other fields, let's assume:
\[P(E|\neg H)_{\text{AgVet}} = 0.2\]

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule is:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where \(P(E)\) (the evidence) can be computed using:
\[P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)\]

For Computer Science:
\[P(E)_{\text{CS}} = 0.3 * 0.2 + 0.1 * 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14\]
\[P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.3 * 0.2}{0.14} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.4286\]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[P(E)_{\text{AgVet}} = 0.7 * 0.05 + 0.2 * 0.95 = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225\]
\[P(H|E)_{\text{AgVet}} = \frac{0.7 * 0.05}{0.225} = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \approx 0.1556\]

### Final Result

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4286,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1556
}
```
