To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to know a few things:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was not in that field.

And we use Bayes' rule, which tells us:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
However, since we do not need \( P(E) \) to compare the probabilities of \( P(H|E) \) for different fields, we can use the simplified form:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's evaluate these terms for each field:

### Computer Science:

- \( P(H) \): Assuming that computer science is a common field, \( P(H) \) might be moderate, let's assume \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality traits like high intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts, he could fit well in computer science. Let's assign a probability of \( 0.5 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of observing Adam's traits if he was not in computer science. Given that we're considering all other fields, and some might also value his traits, it could be moderate. Let's assign \( 0.4 \).

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.1 = 0.05 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- \( P(H) \): Assuming this field is less common than computer science, let's assume \( 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, he seems highly likely to fit well in this field. Let's assign a high probability of \( 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again considering other fields, and the fact that not all other fields might fit him as well, it might be lower. Let's assign \( 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

Now, normalizing these values to get them in the range of 0 to 1 for comparison:

\[ \text{Total} = 0.05 + 0.04 = 0.09 \]

Thus,

### Normalized Probabilities:
- Computer science: \( \frac{0.05}{0.09} \approx 0.56 \)
- Agricultural and veterinary science: \( \frac{0.04}{0.09} \approx 0.44 \)

So, the answer in the required format is:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.56,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.44
}
