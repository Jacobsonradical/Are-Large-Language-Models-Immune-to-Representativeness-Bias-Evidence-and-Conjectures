Let's begin by assigning some probabilities based on the personality sketch of Adam and the specified fields of study.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student in the U.S. We can assume there are many fields of study, so let's estimate this to be relatively low. 
      - P(H) ≈ 0.05
    - **P(E|H):** Given that Adam was studying in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of observing the personality sketch E (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, appreciation for hard work) is quite high.
      - P(E|H) ≈ 0.9
    - **P(E|\neg H):** Given that Adam was not studying agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of observing the personality sketch E is lower because the sketch matches well with the characteristics of someone in this field, but it is not impossible for other fields.
      - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.2

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.9 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times (1 - 0.05)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.19} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.191 \]

2. **Computer Science:**
    - **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student in the U.S. It's reasonable based on the popularity of the field.
      - P(H) ≈ 0.1
    - **P(E|H):** Given that Adam was studying computer science, the probability of observing the personality sketch E (intelligence, aptitude for puzzles and abstract concepts) is moderate to high. 
      - P(E|H) ≈ 0.7
    - **P(E|\neg H):** Given that Adam was not studying computer science, the probability of observing the personality sketch E is moderate because these traits could fit other fields but not as strongly as computer science and similar analytical fields.
      - P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.3

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.7 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times (1 - 0.1)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.27} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.34} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.206 \]

So, the probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.191,
  "computer science": 0.206
}
