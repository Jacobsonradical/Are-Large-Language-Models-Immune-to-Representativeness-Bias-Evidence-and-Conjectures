To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) (the field of study) given the evidence \( E \) (the personality sketch of Adam), we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are interested in the relative probabilities, we don't need the exact value of \( P(E) \) if we are only comparing the hypotheses (fields). We'll use the given evidence and make reasonable assumptions based on the descriptions provided.

Let's define:

- \( P(H) \): the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume a moderate prior of about 0.2. Agricultural and veterinary science is not exceedingly common but fits some of the given personality clues like a love for animals and nature.
- \( P(E|H) \): High, let's say 0.8. The personality sketch aligns well with interests in plants, animals, nature, and empathy, which are relevant to this field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, let's assume it to be around 0.3, as many graduate fields may not align as well with these traits.

Given these values:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): A relatively high prior probability, let's assume 0.3, considering the popularity of this field among graduate students.
- \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, let's say 0.5. While Adam's intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts fit computer science, the love for animals and nature does not align strongly.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume it to be higher than for agricultural science, around 0.6, as many other fields might fit these interests equally well.

Given these values:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.3 = 0.15 \]

### Summary
Now we can normalize these values if needed, but since we're just comparing the probabilities, we can provide the proportional values directly:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "computer science": 0.15
}

These values indicate that while both fields are plausible given Adam's profile, agricultural and veterinary science is slightly more likely based on the evidence provided.
