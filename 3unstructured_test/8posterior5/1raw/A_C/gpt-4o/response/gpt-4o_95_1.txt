To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Note: \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We'll assume some reasonable values for these probabilities based on the provided personality sketch and general knowledge about the fields. Note that these are approximations and not exact values.

### Hypotheses and Probability Estimations:

#### 1. Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a randomly chosen graduate student being in computer science.
  - Let's assume it is 0.25 (25%).

- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the personality traits described if he is a computer science student.
  - Given the quiet, puzzle-solving, and high intelligence traits, we might estimate this as relatively high, say 0.4 (40%).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having those traits if he is not a computer science student.
  - Given his interest in nature and animals, let's assume it is lower, say 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{0.4 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.4 \]

#### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a randomly chosen graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Let's assume it is 0.1 (10%).

- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the personality traits described if he is an agricultural and veterinary science student.
  - Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, we might estimate this as very high, say 0.7 (70%).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having those traits if he is not an agricultural and veterinary science student.
  - Since these traits are strongly aligned with this field, the probability should be lower, say 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.28 \]

### Final Probabilities:

Based on these estimations, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28
}
```

These calculations reflect the likelihood of Adam being in each field given his personality traits, with the highest posterior probability being for computer science.
