To apply Bayes' Theorem, we must first assess the probabilities as follows:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the field.

Using these, we can compute \(P(H|E)\), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.

### Prior Probabilities (P(H))
- \(P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})\): Since graduate students can be enrolled in many fields and agricultural and veterinary sciences are specific but not rare, we could give this a moderate prior probability. Let's assume \(0.1\).
- \(P(\text{computer science})\): Given the popularity and prevalence of computer science programs, let's assume \(0.2\).

### Likelihoods (P(E|H))
- \(P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science})\): Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his strong empathy, significantly increases the likelihood that he's in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \(0.9\).
- \(P(E|\text{computer science})\): While Adam is intelligent and enjoys solving puzzles, his empathy, and interest in nature are less directly associated with computer science. A lower probability seems reasonable here. Let's assume \(0.3\).

### Likelihoods (P(E|\neg H))
We need to assess the probability of Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science or computer science:

- \(P(E|\neg(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}))\): The combination of his traits (empathy, love for nature, etc.) is less common outside this field. Let's assume \(0.4\).
- \(P(E|\neg(\text{computer science}))\): Outside computer science, his traits could be present but might not align as strongly with specific fields. Let's assume \(0.6\).

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.9 \times 0.1 + 0.4 \times 0.9}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.36} = \frac{0.09}{0.45} \approx 0.2
\]

#### Computer Science
\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.6 \times 0.8}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.48} = \frac{0.06}{0.54} \approx 0.111
\]

Combining these results, we obtain:

\[
\{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.111
\}
\]

This analysis suggests that based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science.
