To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll follow these steps:

1. Estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field indicating the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in that particular field.
2. Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) which is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
3. Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) which is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.
4. Use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \).

Let’s start with each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Let's assume generally that the prior probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is not very high among all possible graduate fields. Let's approximate it at around 0.05.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align very well with this field. Let's assume this likelihood to be high, say 0.7.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - Considering the general population of graduate students not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, Adam's characteristics can still be met in other fields but likely less convincingly. We may assume this to be lower, say 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Here, calculating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.095 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.13 \]

And now for \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.27 \]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Let's assume that Computer Science has a moderate prior probability among all possible graduate fields, say around 0.2.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Adam’s intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the traits appreciated in Computer Science. However, his empathy and love for nature and animals might be less typical. Let’s estimate this likelihood at 0.5.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - Considering the general population of graduate students not in Computer Science, some of Adam’s characteristics could still be common. Let's assume this to be 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Here, calculating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.34 \]

And now for \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.29 \]

Therefore, our results for the posterior probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.27,
  "computer science": 0.29
}
