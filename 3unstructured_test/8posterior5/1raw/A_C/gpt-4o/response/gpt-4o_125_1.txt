To determine \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the complement's likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While \( P(E) \) can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, let’s assume we do not have precise numerical values and use some qualitative reasoning to estimate these probabilities in our context.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior \( P(H) \)**:
  Graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science are less common than some other fields, so we might estimate the general prior \( P(H) \) to be relatively lower, e.g., 0.05.
  
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
  Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his warm heart strongly support this field. This would be quite high, say 0.8.
  
- **Complement’s Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
  Adam's characteristics might still somewhat align with fields outside agricultural and veterinary sciences, but less so. Let's consider a moderate likelihood, such as 0.2.

### Computer Science

- **Prior \( P(H) \)**:
  Computer science is a popular field of study, thus the general prior \( P(H) \) might be around 0.20.
  
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
  Computer science typically involves problem-solving and high intellectual capability, which aligns with Adam's traits. However, there is less of a direct connection with his love for nature and animals. This likelihood could be moderate, say 0.3.
  
- **Complement’s Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
  Many fields other than computer science may still capture Adam’s characteristics to some extent, especially fields involving nature and animals, so let’s assign it a moderate value as well, such as 0.35.

We can now use these estimates to compute posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule.

### Calculations

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.1739 \]

#### Computer Science:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.35 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.28 = 0.34 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.34} \approx 0.1765 \]
