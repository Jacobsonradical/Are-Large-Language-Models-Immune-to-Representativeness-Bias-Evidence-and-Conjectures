Sure, let's calculate the probabilities for each field. To do this, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which is stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are only comparing two fields, we can express our calculations utilizing these direct comparisons. The probabilities P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H) are data that we need to estimate subjectively based on the given information.

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- **P(H)** (the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science): Given his interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, let's say there is a reasonable chance. We'll estimate this as 0.15.
  
- **P(E|H)** (the likelihood of E given H): Given that his personality sketch aligns well with someone in this field, we will estimate this as higher, say 0.8.

- **P(E|¬H)** (the likelihood of E given not H): Considering other fields where the personality might not align as much, let's estimate this at a lower value, around 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

But practically, P(E) consists of P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|¬H)(1-P(H)), we can directly compare:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.5 \cdot (1-0.15)} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.425} \approx 0.22 \]

**2. Computer Science**

- **P(H)** (the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science): Given his high intelligence and interest in puzzles, let's say there is a moderate chance. We'll estimate this as 0.2.
  
- **P(E|H)** (the likelihood of E given H): Since some aspects like solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align, we can set this at 0.5.
  
- **P(E|¬H)** (the likelihood of E given not H): We'll use the same value for not being in this field, say around 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot (1-0.2)} \approx \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.4} \approx 0.2 \]

So, based on these subjective estimates and calculations, the conditional probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.22",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}
