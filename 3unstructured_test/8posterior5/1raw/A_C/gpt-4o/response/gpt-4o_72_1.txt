Sure, let's break this down using Bayes' Theorem step-by-step for both fields: computer science and agricultural and veterinary science.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Let's denote this as P(CS). Since we don't have specific information, let's assume a relatively moderate prior for a popular field:
   - P(CS) ≈ 0.2

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is indeed in Computer Science. Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, these attributes align relatively well with typical characteristics of computer science students:
   - P(E|CS) ≈ 0.4

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the evidence given that he is not in Computer Science. Given the diversity of interests that people in non-CS fields can have, including fields that align well with his empathy and love for nature:
   - P(E|¬CS) ≈ 0.2

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) can be derived roughly as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|¬CS) \cdot P(¬CS) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8 = 0.08 + 0.16 = 0.24 \]

Thus, 
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.24} \approx 0.333 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's denote this as P(AgVetSci). Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, a moderate prior is reasonable:
   - P(AgVetSci) ≈ 0.15

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given that he is indeed in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. His interest in nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work align exceptionally well:
   - P(E|AgVetSci) ≈ 0.7

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the evidence given that he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Since there are many other fields where Adam's traits could be applicable, though perhaps not as strongly:
   - P(E|¬AgVetSci) ≈ 0.3

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(AgVetSci|E) = \frac{P(E|AgVetSci) \cdot P(AgVetSci)}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) again can be derived roughly as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|AgVetSci) \cdot P(AgVetSci) + P(E|¬AgVetSci) \cdot P(¬AgVetSci) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85 = 0.105 + 0.255 = 0.36 \]

Thus,
\[ P(AgVetSci|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{0.36} \approx 0.292 \]
