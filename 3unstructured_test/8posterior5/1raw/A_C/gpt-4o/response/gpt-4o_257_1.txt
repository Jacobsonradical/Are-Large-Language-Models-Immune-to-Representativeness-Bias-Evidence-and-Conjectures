First, let's analyze the probabilities for both fields based on Adam's personality sketch E.

### Preliminary Probabilities:

1. **Computer Science (CS) Hypothesis:**
   - **P(H<sub>CS</sub>)**: Prior probability that a random graduate student is in computer science. Typically, there are many students in computer science, so let's assume P(H<sub>CS</sub>) = 0.3.
   - **P(E|H<sub>CS</sub>)**: Likelihood of E (Adam's personality) given that he is in computer science. Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and love for solving puzzles fit well with a computer science profile, but his love for nature and animals doesn't directly align. So let's assume P(E|H<sub>CS</sub>) = 0.4.
   - **P(E|¬H<sub>CS</sub>)**: Likelihood of E given that he is not in computer science. Considering other fields, particularly those that value empathy and a love for animals, it seems relatively more likely. Let's assume P(E|¬H<sub>CS</sub>) = 0.6.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS) Hypothesis:**
   - **P(H<sub>AVS</sub>)**: Prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. There are fewer students in this specific area compared to computer science. So let's assume P(H<sub>AVS</sub>) = 0.1.
   - **P(E|H<sub>AVS</sub>)**: Likelihood of E given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals fits very well with this field. Let's assume P(E|H<sub>AVS</sub>) = 0.8.
   - **P(E|¬H<sub>AVS</sub>)**: Likelihood of E given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering other fields, this is less likely. Let's assume P(E|¬H<sub>AVS</sub>) = 0.3.

### Computing Posterior Probabilities via Bayes' Rule:

For **computer science**:
$$ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} $$

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|¬H_{CS}) \cdot P(¬H_{CS}) \), we can calculate it as:
$$P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.6 \cdot 0.7 = 0.12 + 0.42 = 0.54 $$

So,
$$ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.54} = \frac{0.12}{0.54} \approx 0.222 $$.

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
$$ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} $$

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|¬H_{AVS}) \cdot P(¬H_{AVS}) \), we can calculate it as:
$$P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 $$

So,
$$ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 $$.

### Final Answers:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.222,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229
}
```

These values reflect the posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in computer science and agricultural/veterinary science, respectively, given his personality sketch.
