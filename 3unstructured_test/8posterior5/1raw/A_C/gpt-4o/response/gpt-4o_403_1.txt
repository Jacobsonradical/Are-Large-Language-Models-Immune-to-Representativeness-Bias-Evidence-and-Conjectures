To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) (i.e., Adam being enrolled in a specific field), we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to:
1. Estimate \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch E given that he is in that field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch E given that he is not in that field.
4. Compute \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch E.

Since the information about the exact distributions isn't provided, I'll make reasonable estimates based on typical characteristics for the fields and the described personality sketch of Adam.

### Computer Science
**P(H)**
- The probability that any given graduate student is in computer science. Let's assume this is relatively common, so \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

**P(E|H)**
- The probability that a student in computer science has Adam's personality traits. Given he enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, this seems plausible but not highly specific. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

**P(E|\neg H)**
- The probability that a student not in computer science has Adam's personality traits. Given that the traits described don't strongly lean towards computer science, we avoid assuming significant bias against it. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H)**
- The probability that any given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This is less common than computer science, so \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

**P(E|H)**
- The probability that a student in agricultural and veterinary science has Adam's personality traits. Given his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature, this is highly consistent. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

**P(E|\neg H)**
- The probability that a student not in agricultural and veterinary science has Adam's personality traits. Given the strong affinity for nature and animals in the personality sketch, we assume it's lesser likely for students outside this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

### Calculations
We don't have the exact overall \( P(E) \), so we compute the relative probabilities:

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{avs} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

We compare the estimates directly:
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = 0.06 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{avs} = 0.04 \]

As we don't have the exact \( P(E) \), these values give the relative likelihoods.

### Conclusion
Given the calculated relative likelihoods, the probability estimates for Adam given his personality sketch would be:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
