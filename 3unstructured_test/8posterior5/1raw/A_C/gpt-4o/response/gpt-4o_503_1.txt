Let's evaluate the probabilities and use Bayes' theorem as outlined:

**Bayes' Theorem** states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this scenario:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field (either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
We start with a prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Assuming he could be in any graduate field, for simplicity, let's assign a neutral prior:

\[ P(H) = 0.05 \] (assuming there are many possible fields he could have chosen)

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
Adam's love for nature, plants, empathy, and animals makes it strongly likely that the personality sketch matches someone in this field.

\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):
Assuming 'not agricultural and veterinary science' includes all other fields where the personality might still match to some extent but not as strongly:

\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \]

Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Substituting values:
\[ P(E) = (0.7)(0.05) + (0.2)(0.95) = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225 \]

#### Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{(0.7)(0.05)}{0.225} \approx 0.156 \]

### Computer Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
Using the same approach for prior probability:

\[ P(H) = 0.05 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with computer science but his interest in nature and animals less so:

\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \]

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):
For 'not computer science', the personality sketch could still match other non-related fields, which might also align somewhat:

\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.22 \]

Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Substituting values:
\[ P(E) = (0.3)(0.05) + (0.22)(0.95) = 0.015 + 0.209 = 0.224 \]

#### Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{(0.3)(0.05)}{0.224} \approx 0.067 \]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.156,
  "computer science": 0.067
}
```

This calculation shows that based on the given personality sketch, it's more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
