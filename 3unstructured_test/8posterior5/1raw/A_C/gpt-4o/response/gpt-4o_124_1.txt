To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch E, we will apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to simplify the comparison between fields, we can ignore \( P(E) \) since it is constant for all hypotheses. Hence, we need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for both fields as a means to compare relative likelihoods.

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** There is a relatively high number of students enrolled in computer science programs. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's traits, particularly his strong intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, it is quite likely for him to be in computer science. Perhaps \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of having such a personality if Adam is **not** in computer science. Given the distribution of graduate students in other fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** There are significantly fewer students in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, it is quite probable for him to be in this field. Perhaps \( P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of having such a personality if Adam is **not** in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.6 \cdot 0.05 = 0.03 \]

Combining these, we get the relative likelihoods for the two fields given E:

\[
\{
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.03
\}
\]

Note that these values are proportional and do not add up to 1. For proper probabilities, one would need the normalization constant \( P(E) \), but as requested, this is not required here.
