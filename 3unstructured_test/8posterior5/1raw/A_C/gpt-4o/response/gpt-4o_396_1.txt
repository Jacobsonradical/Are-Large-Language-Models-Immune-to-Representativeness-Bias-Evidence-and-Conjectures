To evaluate the conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science (H_cs) or agricultural and veterinary science (H_av) given his personality sketch (E), we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For our problem, we need to start by estimating the following:
1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: The initial probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field without knowing his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Likelihood of Not Enrolled (P(E|\neg H))**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in a specific field.

### Computer Science (H_cs)
1. **Prior Probability (P(H_cs))**: Computer science is a popular field of study, often with a high enrollment rate. Let's assume:
   \[ P(H_cs) \approx 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H_cs))**: Given Adam's interest in puzzles and intelligence, he could be a fit for computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature seem less related to computer science:
   \[ P(E|H_cs) \approx 0.3 \]

3. **Likelihood of Not Enrolled (P(E|\neg H_cs))**: Considering these traits, there’s a higher chance that individuals with similar profiles might fit other fields better than computer science:
   \[ P(E|\neg H_cs) \approx 0.7 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H_av)
1. **Prior Probability (P(H_av))**: This field is less universally chosen compared to computer science, so we assume:
   \[ P(H_av) \approx 0.1 \]

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H_av))**: Given Adam’s interest in nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy, he seems well-matched for agricultural and veterinary science:
   \[ P(E|H_av) \approx 0.8 \]

3. **Likelihood of Not Enrolled (P(E|\neg H_av))**: People with Adam's profile may still fit well in other fields, though possibly less accurately:
   \[ P(E|\neg H_av) \approx 0.5 \]

### Using Bayes' Theorem
Finally, apply Bayes' theorem for each field.

For computer science:
\[ P(H_cs|E) = \frac{P(E|H_cs) \cdot P(H_cs)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.25}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.075}{P(E)} \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_av|E) = \frac{P(E|H_av) \cdot P(H_av)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) is a normalizing constant, we don’t need its exact value for the comparison:

Now we normalize these to ensure they reflect proportions:
\[ P(H_cs|E) \approx \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.08} = \frac{0.075}{0.155} \approx 0.484 \]
\[ P(H_av|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.075 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.155} \approx 0.516 \]

So, in the format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.484,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.516
}
