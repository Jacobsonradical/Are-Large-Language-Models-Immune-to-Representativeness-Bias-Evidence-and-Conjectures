Sure, let's break down the necessary components for applying Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in a specific field.
- We will then use Bayes' theorem to determine \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the evidence \( E \).

For simplicity and clarity, I'll use rough, qualitative estimates for the probabilities:

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability for this specific field is relatively low because there are numerous fields of graduate study. Let's say 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's evident interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, the probability that he exhibits these traits if he were in this field is high. Let's say 0.9.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam were in another field, it's less likely (but not impossible) he would have this exact combination of traits. Let's estimate this at 0.2.

### 2. Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Similarly, let's assume the prior probability for this field being chosen is 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): While Adam is described as intelligent and liking puzzles (which fits), his other traits (nature, animals, empathy) are less aligned with typical motivators for studying computer science. Let's estimate this at 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The general probability that someone not in computer science would exhibit those traits is estimated at 0.2.

We can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

where \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \).

### Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E)_{Agri} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{Agri} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.19} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{Agri} = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{Agri} \approx 0.1915 \]

### Calculation for Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.05}{0.3 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.19} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.015}{0.205} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \approx 0.0732 \]

Therefore, here are the probabilities for each field given Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1915,
  "computer science": 0.0732
}
```

This demonstrates that, given the personality sketch, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
