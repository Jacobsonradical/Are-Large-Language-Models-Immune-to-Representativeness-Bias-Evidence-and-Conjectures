To answer the question appropriately, let's follow the logical steps and apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, computed as:   
 \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Due to the nature of the question and the given data, we'll assume some reasonable but subjective probabilities:

1. **Prior Probabilities (\( P(H) \))**:
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \)
   
2. **Probability of Evidence Given the Hypotheses (\( P(E|H) \))**:
   - For **computer science**:
     - Curiosity about nature and abstract reasoning fits somewhat, but not perfectly.
     - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \)
   - For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
     - Curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart strongly align.
     - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.9 \)

3. **Probability of Evidence Given Not the Hypotheses (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**:
   - Since we have many other fields and our evidence is somewhat general, a fair average across remaining fields is needed.
   - Assume average of 0.2 (\( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)).

Now, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(E) = \sum_i P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + \sum_{\neg H} P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.3 - 0.1) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.09 + 0.2 \cdot 0.6 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.09 + 0.12 = 0.33 \]

- For **computer science**:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.33} \approx 0.364 \]

- For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.33} \approx 0.273 \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.364,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.273
}
