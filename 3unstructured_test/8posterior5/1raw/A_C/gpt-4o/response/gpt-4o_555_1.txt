To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and the characteristics needed for different fields. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Define P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field. Without specific data, we'll assume general enrollment statistics in graduate fields in the U.S.

2. **Define P(E|H):** This is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E if Adam is enrolled in the given field.

3. **Define P(E|\neg H):** This is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E if Adam is not enrolled in the given field.

4. **Compute P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule:** 
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor that is constant for both fields, it will not affect the comparative results, so we can consider the relative likelihoods instead of exact probabilities.

Now, let's evaluate:

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** Without specific data, we'll assume a moderate prior probability. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H):** Given Adam's personality:
   - High intelligence and abstract thinking: strong fit
   - Curiosity and puzzle-solving: relevant
   However, a less direct connection to empathy and animals.
   We'll assume moderately high: \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** This will represent the probability of the personality traits being observed in fields other than computer science. Since these traits are somewhat general:
   - Assume moderate: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H):** Assume prior probability reflecting enrollment statistics: \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H):** Given Adam's personality:
   - Strong empathy and love for animals: strong fit
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work: high relevance
   This field highly matches the sketch: \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Probability that these traits are observed in other fields:
   - Assume lower than for computer science, as the fit is quite specific: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Relative Comparison

- **Computer Science:** \( P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1 \)
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** \( P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \)

Finally, adjusting for proportionality where \( P(E) \) and the comparison value are normalized:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
```

Please note that the total is less than 1 because we've only accounted for two specific fields among many possible fields of study. The actual values indicate relative support rather than outright probabilities.
