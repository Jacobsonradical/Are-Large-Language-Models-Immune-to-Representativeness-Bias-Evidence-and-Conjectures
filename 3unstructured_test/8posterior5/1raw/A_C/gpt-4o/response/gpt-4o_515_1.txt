To compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) across all possible fields.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in the specified field.

For the purposes of this answer, let's use subjective approximations for the probabilities:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **\( P(H) \)**: Assuming computer science is a common field, let's take \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.2 \).
   - **\( P(E|H_{cs}) \)**: Given the personality sketch, Adam's traits seem less aligned with a typical computer science student who might not typically focus on nature and animals. Let's set \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.1 \).
   - **\( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \)**: Adam's personality traits are more aligned with fields related to nature and animals. Thus, we might assume \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.25 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **\( P(H) \)**: Assuming this field is less common but relevant to Adam's traits, let's take \( P(H_{ag\&vet}) = 0.05 \).
   - **\( P(E|H_{ag\&vet}) \)**: Adam's personality description fits very well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's set \( P(E|H_{ag\&vet}) = 0.6 \).
   - **\( P(E|\neg H_{ag\&vet}) \)**: Given that Adam's characteristics are more related to this field specifically, suppose \( P(E|\neg H_{ag\&vet}) = 0.2 \).

Now we can compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \cdot P(\neg H_{cs})}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.25 \cdot (1 - 0.2)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.25 \cdot 0.8}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.2}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.22} \approx 0.0909
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(H_{ag\&vet}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ag\&vet}) \cdot P(H_{ag\&vet})}{P(E|H_{ag\&vet}) \cdot P(H_{ag\&vet}) + P(E|\neg H_{ag\&vet}) \cdot P(\neg H_{ag\&vet})}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{ag\&vet}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.05}{0.6 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.05)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{ag\&vet}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{ag\&vet}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.19}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{ag\&vet}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.22} \approx 0.1364
   \]

Given the subjective approximations provided above:
