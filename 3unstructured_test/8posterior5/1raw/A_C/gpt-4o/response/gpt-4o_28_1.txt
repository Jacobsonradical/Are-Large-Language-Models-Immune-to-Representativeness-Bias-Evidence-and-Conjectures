Let's denote the probabilities and solve for \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field,
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is enrolled in the field,
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not enrolled in the field,
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):**
   - Given that Computer Science is a common field, let's assume Adam has a moderate chance of being enrolled in it. We can estimate \( P(computer \, science) \) at around 0.2.

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
   - The personality sketch mentions curiosity, intelligence, and solving puzzles. These traits align reasonably well with someone in Computer Science.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|computer \, science) \) at around 0.3.

3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - For other fields, these personality traits might also be present but perhaps not as strongly. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg computer \, science) \) around 0.15.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(computer \, science|E) = \frac{P(E|computer \, science) \cdot P(computer \, science)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{?} \]

(Note: Since we don't have the exact value for \( P(E) \), we will not normalize it here but rather understand the relative weighting.)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):**
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science is less common but related to the personality sketch details. We could estimate \( P(agricultural \, and \, veterinary \, science) \) at around 0.1.

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
   - The personality sketch features a strong love for animals and nature, aligning well with this field.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|agricultural \, and \, veterinary \, science) \) at a higher value, say 0.6.

3. **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - These personality traits might be less common in other fields excluding this specific one. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg agricultural \, and \, veterinary \, science) \) around 0.1.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(agricultural \, and \, veterinary \, science|E) = \frac{P(E|agricultural \, and \, veterinary \, science) \cdot P(agricultural \, and \, veterinary \, science)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{?} \]

### Answers

Given these rough estimates and understanding that the exact value of \( P(E) \) will normalize them, we can see the relative probability:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,  // 0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.06 // 0.6 * 0.1 = 0.06
}
```

Both fields end up with similar scores from this rough estimation. However, keep in mind these are simplified estimations and the exact interpretation could vary with more precise data. The strong alignment of personality traits with Agricultural and Veterinary Science might suggest a higher weight than shown here.
