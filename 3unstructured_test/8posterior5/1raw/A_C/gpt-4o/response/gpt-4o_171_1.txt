To estimate the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to assess the relevant probabilities for each field using Bayes' rule.

First, let's denote:
- \( H_{\text{CS}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{\text{AVS}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( E \) as the personality sketch of Adam.

We need to calculate:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E | \neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E | H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E | \neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the information in the personality sketch:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Graduate programs in computer science are relatively common, so let's assume a moderate prior probability, say \( 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \): While computer science students can be curious, intelligent, and good at solving puzzles, they typically do not focus as much on nature, plants, and animals. Thus, let’s say this likelihood is moderate at \( 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E | \neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Considering the broader population of graduate students (including many non-CS fields), Adam’s profile might fit better elsewhere. Let’s assume \( 0.8 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): These programs are less common than computer science but would definitely attract students with strong empathy, love for nature, plants, and animals. Let’s assign a prior probability of \( 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E | H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Adam’s profile matches perfectly with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. So, let’s assign a high likelihood, say \( 0.9 \).
   - \( P(E | \neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): For the broader population of graduate students, his profile would match somewhat but not as well as in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume \( 0.2 \).

Now we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) is the normalization factor:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_\text{CS}) \cdot P(H_\text{CS}) + P(E | H_\text{AVS}) \cdot P(H_\text{AVS}) + \ldots \]

For simplicity, let's focus on comparing the relative Bayesian updates rather than calculating the exact values, since the other fields’ probabilities will remain as constants in a simplified comparison.

1. **For Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) \propto P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

2. **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}} | E) \propto P(E | H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]

Comparative Values:
\[
\{
  "computer science": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045
\}
\]

Based on the relative comparison, Adam’s profile fits slightly better with agricultural and veterinary science despite the lower prior.

Therefore, the output is:
\[
\{
  "computer science": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045
\}
\]
