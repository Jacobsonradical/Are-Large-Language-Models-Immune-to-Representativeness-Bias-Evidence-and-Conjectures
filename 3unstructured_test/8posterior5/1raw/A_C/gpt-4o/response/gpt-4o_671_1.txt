To evaluate the probabilities as requested, we need to consider several factors:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field without knowing any specifics about his personality.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in a particular field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not enrolled in that particular field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, calculated using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Given this framework, let's make some reasonable assumptions to compute these probabilities. Note that exact values for these probabilities can vary without precise statistical data, so the values given are educated estimates.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of any given graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low compared to more common fields like computer science. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, the probability that his personality matches someone in this field is relatively high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.60 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of someone who is not in agricultural and veterinary science having a similar personality sketch is assumed to be lower. Let's assume it to be \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.10 \).

Using these estimates,

\[ P(E) = (0.60 \times 0.05) + (0.10 \times 0.95) = 0.03 + 0.095 = 0.125 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.60 \times 0.05}{0.125} = \frac{0.03}{0.125} = 0.24 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of any given graduate student being in computer science is relatively high, as it is a common field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of someone in computer science having a personality that fits Adam's profile is moderate, considering his intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles, but perhaps less fitting for his love for nature and animals. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.30 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of someone who is not in computer science having a personality sketch similar to Adam's is assumed to be \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.10 \).

Using these estimates,

\[ P(E) = (0.30 \times 0.15) + (0.10 \times 0.85) = 0.045 + 0.085 = 0.13 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \times 0.15}{0.13} = \frac{0.045}{0.13} \approx 0.346 \]

### Final Representation

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "computer science": 0.346
}
```

These values suggest that given Adam's personality sketch, it is somewhat more likely that he could be in computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary science, although this analysis recognizes a fair degree of uncertainty and sensitivity to the chosen prior probabilities.
