In order to compute \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the marginal probability \(P(E)\). Remember that Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, because the question does not provide explicit numerical values, I'll assume some typical priors and likelihoods based on the given personality sketch of Adam, and I'll make educated guesses to demonstrate how to compute those probabilities.

### For Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Given the variety of fields in graduate studies, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is a computer science student. Given Adam's quiet nature, intelligence, and problem-solving skills, this might be quite high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is not a computer science student. Since curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals might not be as typical for computer science students, we'll assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given that this is a less common field compared to general fields like computer science, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is an agricultural and veterinary science student. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this is likely very high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is not an agricultural and veterinary science student. Given that these traits are quite specific to this field, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Note that \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \), but since we are only interested in the relative magnitude, we can proceed without computing \( P(E) \) explicitly.

Calculations:

### For Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Relative probability:

- For Computer Science: 
\[ \text{Relative } P(H|E) = 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 
\[ \text{Relative } P(H|E) = 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \]

Now normalize (optional but to show proportions):

\[ \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.09} \approx 0.526 \]

\[ \frac{0.09}{0.1 + 0.09} \approx 0.473 \]

Thus, our final estimations are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.526,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.473
}
```
Note that these values might be further refined with exact numbers for the priors and likelihoods.
