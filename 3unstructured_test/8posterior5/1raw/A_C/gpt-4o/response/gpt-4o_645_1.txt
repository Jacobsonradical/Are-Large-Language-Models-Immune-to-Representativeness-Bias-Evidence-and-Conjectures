Sure, let's work through this step-by-step.

Firstly, we will make reasonable estimates for P(H) — the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field. This is a rough estimate considering the general popularity of these fields among graduate students:

- Computer Science is a very popular field for graduate studies: P(H_computer_science) ≈ 0.1
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science is less common but still significant: P(H_agricultural) ≈ 0.05

Next, let's estimate P(E|H), the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he is in each respective field.

- For Computer Science, let's reason that while people in this field often exhibit high intelligence and an interest in abstract concepts, the specific traits like love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles are less strongly associated: P(E|H_computer_science) ≈ 0.01
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science, his traits align much better (e.g., love for animals, nature): P(E|H_agricultural) ≈ 0.2

Now, P(E|\neg H), which is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he is not in the specified field.

- For not being in computer science (considering the vastness of other fields): P(E|\neg H_computer_science) ≈ 0.02
- For not being in agricultural and veterinary science: P(E|\neg H_agricultural) ≈ 0.005

We now use Bayes' Rule to calculate the posterior probability P(H|E):

**Bayes' Rule:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where,

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E)_\text{computer science} = \frac{ (0.01) \cdot (0.1)}{(0.01 \cdot 0.1) + (0.02 \cdot 0.9)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.001}{0.001 + 0.018} \]
\[ = \frac{0.001}{0.019} \]
\[ ≈ 0.0526 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H|E)_\text{agricultural} = \frac{(0.2) \cdot (0.05)}{(0.2 \cdot 0.05) + (0.005 \cdot 0.95)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.00475} \]
\[ = \frac{0.01}{0.01475} \]
\[ ≈ 0.678 \]

Finally, presenting the calculated probabilities:
