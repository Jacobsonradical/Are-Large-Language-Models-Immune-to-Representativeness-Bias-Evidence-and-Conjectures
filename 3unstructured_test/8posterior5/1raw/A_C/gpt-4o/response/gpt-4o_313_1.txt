To compute \( P(H|E) \) for both hypotheses using Bayes' theorem, we need the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the respective fields.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in the respective fields.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in the respective fields.

We then use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, instead of calculating \( P(E) \), we'll focus on comparing the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) for each field under consideration, under the assumption that the total probability distribution for all fields (including those not mentioned) is normalized.

Now let's make reasoned estimates for each probability:

### Computer Science

- **\( P(H) \)**:
  - Let's assume a moderate prior probability. Computer Science is a popular graduate field.
  - Assume \( P(H) = 0.25 \).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**:
  - While Computer Science graduates may have high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, it's less likely for the field to specifically attract someone with a deep love for animals and nature.
  - Estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
  - Given that Computer Science does not specifically cater to Adam's personality sketch, it seems consistent that those not in Computer Science might more likely fit Adam's description.
  - Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(H) \)**:
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science is a less common graduate field compared to Computer Science.
  - Estimate \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**:
  - This field closely aligns with Adam's love for nature, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work.
  - Estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
  - Given the personality sketch, it is less likely for those not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science domains to fit Adam's description.
  - Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Applying Bayes' Theorem

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

We can ignore \( P(E) \) for comparative purposes. Instead, we can directly compare the numerators since \( P(E) \) is common for both \( H \):

Relative weight for Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.025 \]

Relative weight for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

Converting to relative probabilities:
- The total relative weight is \( 0.025 + 0.04 = 0.065 \).

Thus, the normalized probabilities become:
- For Computer Science:
\[ \frac{0.025}{0.065} \approx 0.38 \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ \frac{0.04}{0.065} \approx 0.62 \]

These values represent the relative likelihood of Adam being enrolled in the respective field, given his personality sketch.
