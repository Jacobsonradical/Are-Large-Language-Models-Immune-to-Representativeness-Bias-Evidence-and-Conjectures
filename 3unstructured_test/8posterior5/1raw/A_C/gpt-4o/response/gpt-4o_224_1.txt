Sure, let's evaluate the probabilities for the hypotheses:

**Computer Science:**
- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, since it's one of the most common fields, might be around 0.2.
- P(E|H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science. Given his traits, curiosity about nature and abstract thinking could fit, but the strong empathy and love for animals are less common. I'll estimate this at 0.3.
- P(E|\neg H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in computer science. This is a bit trickier, but considering there are many other fields, I'll estimate this at 0.7. 

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower due to fewer students generally being in this field. Let's estimate this at 0.05.
- P(E|H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science should be high since his traits match well. I'll estimate this at 0.8.
- P(E|\neg H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science would be lower. Let's estimate this at 0.4.

Now, let's compute P(H|E) using Bayes' rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Since we do not have \(P(E)\) directly, we can compare relative posterior probabilities.

### For Computer Science:
\[P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.06 / P(E)\]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[P(H|E)_{AV} = \frac{P(E|H)_{AV} \cdot P(H)_{AV}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = 0.04 / P(E)\]

Now let's normalize them just for comparison:

### Normalized Relative Values:
\[P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.04} = \frac{0.06}{0.1} = 0.6\]
\[P(H|E)_{AV} = \frac{0.04}{0.06 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.1} = 0.4\]

Therefore, the normalized relative probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
