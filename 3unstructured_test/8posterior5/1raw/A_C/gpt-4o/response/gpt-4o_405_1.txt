To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's how we break it down:
  
1. **P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.**
2. **P(E|H): The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in that field.**
3. **P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not enrolled in that field.**
4. **Bayes' theorem:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (total probability of observing the personality sketch) is constant for comparison between fields, we can compare:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Assumptions for Calculation

- **P(H):** Assume a uniform prior for simplicity or based on common enrollment statistics (though not provided, we assume uniformity between fields).
- **P(E|H) and P(E|\neg H):** Assess how well the personality sketch matches typical students in each field.

### Estimates:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, empathy, and love for animals, this field seems highly plausible.
   - **P(H):** Moderate, let's assume a typical prior, say 0.1 (as not overly common but related fields).
   - **P(E|H):** High, given the sketch aligns closely with interests in this field. Let's say 0.8.
   - **P(E|\neg H):** Lower, as the personality sketch would be less common in unrelated fields. Let’s assume 0.2.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

2. **Computer science:**
   - While Adam's intelligence and love for solving puzzles fit well, his curiosity about nature, plants, and empathy towards animals may be less relevant here.
   - **P(H):** Moderate, assuming a typical prior, say 0.1.
   - **P(E|H):** Moderate, the curiosity and puzzle traits fit, less so with other traits. Let’s say 0.4.
   - **P(E|\neg H):** Similiar rationale as above. Let’s assume 0.2.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04 \] 

  

### Final Relative Probability:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.04
}
```

Though these probabilities might not sum to 1 or represent actual probabilities needing normalization, they give a relative sense of likelihood based on the given personality sketch.
