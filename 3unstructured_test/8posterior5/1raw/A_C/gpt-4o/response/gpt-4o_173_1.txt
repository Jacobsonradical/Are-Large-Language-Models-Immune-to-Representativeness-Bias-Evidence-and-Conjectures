Sure, let’s go through the Bayesian inference process for each hypothesis.

### Computer Science

#### P(H) – Prior Probability
The probability of being enrolled in Computer Science (CS) without any other information. Given it’s a very common field, let’s assign it a moderate probability: 
\[ P(\text{CS}) = 0.3 \]

#### P(E|H) – Likelihood
The probability of Adam’s personality sketch E given that he is in CS.
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: This is not highly typical for CS students but not impossible either.
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles: Fits well with a CS profile.
- Warm heart, empathy, love for animals and appreciates hard work: Not much differentiation here for CS students.

Since some aspects fit well and others do not, let’s assign it a moderate value: 
\[ P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.5 \]

#### P(E|¬H) – Likelihood of personality sketch given not in CS
We need to consider the likelihood of Adam’s characteristics for non-CS fields, which is quite broad. Likelihood might be slightly higher given the range of fields matches his profile more closely:

\[ P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.6 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### P(H) – Prior Probability
The probability of being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS) is presumably lower than CS due to fewer students typically enrolling. Let’s reasonably assume:
\[ P(\text{AVS}) = 0.1 \]

#### P(E|H) – Likelihood
The probability of Adam’s personality sketch given that he is in AVS:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Fits very well.
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles: Fairly neutral but possible.
- Warm heart, empathy, love for animals and appreciates hard work: Fits very well.

So, this likelihood is higher:
\[ P(E|\text{AVS}) = 0.8 \]

#### P(E|¬H) – Likelihood of personality sketch given not in AVS
Since being in AVS is specific and his profile fits quite well with it, the likelihood P(E|¬H_avs) might be slightly lower:

\[ P(E|\neg \text{AVS}) = 0.5 \]

### Applying Bayes Rule

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \cdot P(\neg \text{CS})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.6 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.42} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.57} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx 0.263 \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS})}{P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS}) + P(E|\neg \text{AVS}) \cdot P(\neg \text{AVS})} \]
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.45} \]
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.53} \]
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) \approx 0.151 \]
