To use Bayes' rule, we need to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, given the information in the personality sketch \( E \). The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we only have information about two potential fields, we need to estimate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the specified field (sum of probabilities for all other possible fields).

Let's break down the values for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Since there are numerous fields of study, we can assume a relatively small prior for each specific one.
   \[
   P(H_{\text{Ag. and Vet. Science}}) \approx 0.05
   \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given the personality sketch of Adam, he has a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and empathy, which fits well with agricultural and veterinary science.
   \[
   P(E|H_{\text{Ag. and Vet. Science}}) \approx 0.8
   \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Considering the personality traits of Adam, they could fit other fields such as biology, conservation science, etc. 
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{Ag. and Vet. Science}}) \approx 0.2
   \]

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Again, we assume a relatively small prior probability for each specific field.
   \[
   P(H_{\text{Computer Science}}) \approx 0.05
   \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam is intelligent and good at solving puzzles, which are relevant traits for computer science, but his strong focus on nature and animals doesn't align perfectly.
   \[
   P(E|H_{\text{Computer Science}}) \approx 0.3
   \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: His traits fit slightly less well with computer science compared to fields like agricultural and veterinary science.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{Computer Science}}) \approx 0.7
   \]

Now, let's apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[
P(H_{\text{Ag. and Vet. Science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{Ag. and Vet. Science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Ag. and Vet. Science}})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{Ag. and Vet. Science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174
\]

### Computer Science
\[
P(H_{\text{Computer Science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{Computer Science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Computer Science}})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{Computer Science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.05}{0.3 \cdot 0.05 + 0.7 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.665} = \frac{0.015}{0.680} \approx 0.022
\]

Finally, we represent the probabilities as requested:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
