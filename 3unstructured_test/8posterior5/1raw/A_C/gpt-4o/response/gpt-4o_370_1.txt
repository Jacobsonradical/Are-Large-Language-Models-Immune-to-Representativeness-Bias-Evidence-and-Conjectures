To solve this using Bayes' Theorem, we need to estimate the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the evidence against the hypothesis \(P(E|\neg H)\).

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expressed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, we can focus on the relative probabilities rather than computing the exact values of \( P(E) \), because we are comparing two fields. Let's denote:
- \( P(H_{AG}) \) as the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) as the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science.

Now let's define the estimations based on Adam's personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H_{AG})**:
We'll assume that Adam's interests and traits such as a love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work increase the prior probability of him being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. So let's assign a prior probability:
\[ P(H_{AG}) = 0.2 \]

**P(E|H_{AG})**:
Given that Adam is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, the probability of having those traits and interests is high:
\[ P(E|H_{AG}) = 0.9 \]

**P(E|\neg H_{AG})**:
Given that Adam is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, the probability of still having those traits would be lower but possible since itâ€™s not exclusive:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{AG}) = 0.4 \]

### Computer Science
**P(H_{CS})**:
Even though Adam has high intelligence and is good at abstract thinking, his love for nature and animals might slightly decrease the prior probability of him choosing Computer Science. Thus:
\[ P(H_{CS}) = 0.1 \]

**P(E|H_{CS})**:
Given that Adam is in Computer Science, the probability of having the traits and interests might be lower:
\[ P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.3 \]

**P(E|\neg H_{CS})**:
Given that Adam is not in Computer Science, the probability of having those traits might be slightly higher since his traits might attract him to other fields:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.6 \]

Using these values, we now compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AG}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AG}) \cdot P(H_{AG})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

We can ignore \(P(E)\) for comparison purposes:
\[ P(H_{AG}|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.2 = 0.18 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03 \]

Normalizing:
\[ P(H_{AG}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.03} = \frac{0.18}{0.21} \approx 0.857 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.18 + 0.03} = \frac{0.03}{0.21} \approx 0.143 \]

So, the updated probabilities are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.857,
  "computer science": 0.143
}
