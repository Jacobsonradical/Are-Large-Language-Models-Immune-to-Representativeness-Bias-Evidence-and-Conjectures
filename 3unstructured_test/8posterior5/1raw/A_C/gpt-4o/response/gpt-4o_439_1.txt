To solve this, we can apply Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, for this exercise, we'll calculate the relative probabilities independently for each hypothesis field of study: agricultural and veterinary science and computer science. Since we don't have exact values of probabilities, we'll use reasonable assumptions based on the information provided. 

We'll break down everything step by step:

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**
   - Let's assume that an average university might have a lower enrollment rate in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer-related fields. So, let's assume P(H) = 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.8 (80%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**
   - Considering all other fields, these traits might be less common. Let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 (20%).

Now applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**
   - Given the popularity of computer science, let's assume P(H) = 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H)**
   - Adam's traits like high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well. Empathy is not as strongly linked. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.5 (50%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**
   - These traits, while significant, are not necessarily exclusive to computer science. Let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 (30%).

Now applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1 \]

Summarizing, we get:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.1
}
```

These values are approximate and reflect relative likelihoods given the assumptions we made about Adam's prior probabilities and the likelihood of his personality traits fitting within each field. The actual likelihoods would depend on more specific contextual information.
