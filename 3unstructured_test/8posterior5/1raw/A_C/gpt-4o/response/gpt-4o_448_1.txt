To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to assess the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the complement likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then we can calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that these are simplified estimates for illustration purposes:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \) (Initial probability assuming enrollment in Computer Science): Let's assume it is 0.2 given it’s a popular field among graduate students.
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Probability of personality traits given Computer Science): Adam has traits like high intelligence and analytical skills, which are somewhat related to Computer Science, but other traits like love for nature and animals are less related. Let's approximate this to 0.2.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of personality traits given not in Computer Science): Assuming a reasonable level of overlap, let's estimate this at 0.05.

Using Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.05 \cdot 0.8} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.08} = 0.5 \]


2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \) (Initial probability assuming enrollment in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): Let’s assume it to be 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Probability of personality traits given Agricultural and Veterinary Science): Adam's traits are strongly aligned with this field (love for nature, animals, empathy, etc.). Let's approximate this to 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of personality traits given not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): Let's approximate this to be similar to the non-Computer Science estimate, say 0.05.

Using Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.05 \cdot 0.9} \approx \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.045} = \frac{0.07}{0.115} \approx 0.609 \]

Therefore, the results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.609
