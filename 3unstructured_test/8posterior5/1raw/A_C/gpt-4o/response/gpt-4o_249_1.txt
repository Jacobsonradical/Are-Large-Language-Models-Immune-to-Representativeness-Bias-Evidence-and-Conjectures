To evaluate the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in the specified fields based on the given personality sketch (E), we can use Bayes' rule, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

The probabilities involved are defined as follows:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch assuming Adam was enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch assuming Adam was not enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.

We will provide the values within a reasonable estimation range for each field based on the personality sketch and context.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student. Since this is a less common field compared to others but aligns well with Adam's interest in nature and animals, we'll assume it's moderately likely \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \).
  
- P(E|H): The likelihood of observing his personality traits given that he was in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy, this fits well \( P(E|H) \approx 0.80 \).
  
- P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he was in another field. Since empathy, interest in nature, and puzzles can be found across various fields, this is moderately likely \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.30 \).

### Computer Science

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. This is a common field and could be highly probable \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \).
  
- P(E|H): The likelihood of observing his personality traits given that he was in computer science. While his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills fit well, his interests in nature and animals are less directly related \( P(E|H) \approx 0.40 \).
  
- P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he was in another field. This remains general as before \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.30 \).

### Calculations for Posterior Probabilities

Using these values, we can compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

We don't need \( P(E) \) to compare the probabilities; we can just use the numerator.

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.10 = 0.08 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.40 \cdot 0.15 = 0.06 \]

Based on these numerators, the relative probabilities are normalized but compared directly:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \approx 0.08 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} \approx 0.06 \]
