To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) to compute this. While the exact probabilities cannot be determined without specific data, we can make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch and general knowledge.

The steps to compute \( P(H|E) \) for both fields are as follows:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Let \( H \) be the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
   - P(H): The general probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in Computer Science can be assumed to be moderate due to its popularity.
   - P(E|H): The likelihood that Adam has the described traits if he were in Computer Science. Given his intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, this is relatively high.
   - P(E|\neg H): The likelihood that Adam has these traits if he were not in Computer Science. This probability is also moderate as these traits are not exclusive to Computer Science.

   Approximate values:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) (assuming a moderately high enrollment in Computer Science among graduate students)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

   Using Bayes' rule:

   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.4 \times 0.3 + 0.2 \times (1 - 0.3)} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.14} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.26} \approx 0.46 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Let \( H \) be the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - P(H): The general probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science can be assumed to be lower than Computer Science.
   - P(E|H): Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, this is relatively high.
   - P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of Adam having these traits if he were not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is lower given that such traits align well with this field.

   Approximate values:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (assuming a lower enrollment in Agricultural and Veterinary Science among graduate students)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

   Using Bayes' rule:

   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{0.6 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times (1 - 0.1)} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.18} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.24} \approx 0.25 \]

Final values in the required format:

{
  "computer science": 0.46,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25
