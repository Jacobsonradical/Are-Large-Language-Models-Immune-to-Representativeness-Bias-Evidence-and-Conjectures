To determine \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

We'll estimate the probabilities for each field:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam was in that field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not in that field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Agricultural and veterinary science might be a less common graduate field compared to others, but let's assume it has a moderate prior probability for a nature-loving, animal-empathetic person. I'll estimate \( P(H) \) to be 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's deep love for nature and animals, the probability of his personality traits if he were in this field is quite high. I'll estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.9.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Since the personality traits do not necessarily exclude other fields but are still quite aligned with agriculture or veterinary sciences compared to the general graduate student population, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.2}{P(E)}
\]
where
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.9 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8 = 0.18 + 0.24 = 0.42
\]

Thus,
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.2}{0.42} \approx 0.429
\]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Computer science is a very common field for graduate students, so I'll estimate \( P(H) \) to be 0.3.
2. **P(E|H)**: While Adam's traits of solving puzzles and high intelligence align somewhat with computer science, the deep love for nature and empathy for animals are less directly relevant. I'll estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.4.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given the specific nature-related traits, the probability of these traits in other graduate fields might be lower. I'll estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{P(E)}
\]
where
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.4 \times 0.3 + 0.4 \times 0.7 = 0.12 + 0.28 = 0.40
\]

Thus,
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.40} = 0.3
\]
