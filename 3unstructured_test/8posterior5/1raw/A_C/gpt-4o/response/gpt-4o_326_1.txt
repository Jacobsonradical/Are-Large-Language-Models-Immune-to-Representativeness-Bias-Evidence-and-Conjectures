To apply Bayes' rule, we'll calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis H (the field Adam was enrolled in), given the personality sketch E. Here are the steps and initial assumptions for each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science. We'll assume a moderate level since computer science is a popular field.
   - **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he is a computer science student. While curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving align well, the strong empathy and love for animals are less typical.
   - **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he is not a computer science student. Since these traits can fit many other fields, we'll assume it's relatively high.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common, so we assume a lower prior probability.
   - **P(E|H):** Many aspects of Adam's personality, such as curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and empathy, fit well with this field.
   - **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he's not in this field. Since these traits particularly fit this field well, we'll assume it to be lower compared to computer science.

Let's assign some approximate values:

### Computer Science:
- **P(H_computer_science):** 0.3
- **P(E|H_computer_science):** 0.4
- **P(E|¬H_computer_science):** 0.6

By Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) \) as the denominator needing normalization, we compute the numerator for the relative probabilities:

\[ P(H_computer_science|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science):** 0.1
- **P(E|H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science):** 0.8
- **P(E|¬H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science):** 0.4

By Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Again, calculating the numerator for relative comparison:
\[ P(H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

Now, to compare these probabilities, we note that the actual values need \( P(E) \) for full normalization. But for the relative assessment:

- Computer Science: 0.12 normalized by P(E)
- Agricultural and Veterinary: 0.08 normalized by P(E)

Since these are on a similar scale and recognizing animal and nature-based empathy weighs more for agricultural and veterinary, which may slightly inflate its relative posterior.

In conclusion, provided rough estimates:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

These numbers are indicative and should prioritize the closer fit of Adam's empathetic and nature-oriented traits to agricultural and veterinary sciences.
