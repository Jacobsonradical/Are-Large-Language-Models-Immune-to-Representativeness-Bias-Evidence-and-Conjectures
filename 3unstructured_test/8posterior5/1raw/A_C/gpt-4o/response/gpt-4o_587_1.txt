To calculate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he is not enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality, which can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's consider each field:

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability is relatively high, say about \( 0.20 \), because computer science is a common field for graduate students in the U.S.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that computer science involves logical thinking and puzzle-solving, we might assign a moderate value, say \( 0.40 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the likelihood that Adam's personality appears if he is not in computer science. Given his traits are somewhat aligned yet not exclusive to computer science, let's assign it \( 0.10 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability could be lower than computer science, say \( 0.10 \), since it’s less common.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s love for nature, animals, and a high appreciation for hard work, we can assume a high likelihood, say \( 0.70 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the specificity of his traits, we might estimate this lower, around \( 0.05 \).

#### Normalization:
##### For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.40 \cdot 0.20) + (0.10 \cdot 0.80) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.08 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.16 \]

##### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.70 \cdot 0.10) + (0.05 \cdot 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.045 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.115 \]

#### Posterior Probabilities:
##### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.20}{0.16} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.50 \]

##### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.10}{0.115} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.115} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.609 \]

Putting these together, the probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.50,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.609
