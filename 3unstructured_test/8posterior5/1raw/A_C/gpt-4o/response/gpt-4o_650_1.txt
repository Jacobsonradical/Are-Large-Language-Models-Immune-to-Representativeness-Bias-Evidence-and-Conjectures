To solve this, we will apply Bayes' theorem, which can be expressed as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \).

Let's assume the following values for the priors and likelihoods based on Adam's personality sketch and assumptions about the distributions in these fields.

### For Computer Science:
- **P(H)**, the prior probability that a graduate student is in Computer Science, let's assume it to be 0.2. This is a reasonable prior given the popularity of the field.
- **P(E|H)**, the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in Computer Science, let's assume this is relatively low at 0.1. While intelligence and puzzle-solving fit, the high empathy, love for nature, and animals are less characteristic.
- **P(E|¬H)**, the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in Computer Science, let's assume this is also low at 0.2, but can be slightly higher as these traits don't directly conflict with not being in CS.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**, the prior probability that a graduate student is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, let's assume it to be 0.05. This is a less common field.
- **P(E|H)**, the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, let's assume this is high at 0.8, since the traits align well with this field.
- **P(E|¬H)**, the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, let's assume this is quite low at 0.15 due to the specific combination of traits.

Now, we need to combine these priors and likelihoods to find \( P(H|E) \).

We need to compute the total probability \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

For simplicity, let's compute \( P(E) \) intuitively for each field, to allow \( P(H|E) \) to be compared. We can normalize later if needed.

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.18} \approx 0.111\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.15 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.04}{0.1825} \approx 0.219 \]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.219
}
