To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to apply the formula for each field:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have explicit values, we will need to rely on qualitative assessments of the probabilities involved:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the particular field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in the particular field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in the particular field.
4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits (this can be considered a normalizing constant).

For each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Moderate to high. This field aligns well with interest in nature, plants, and animals.
- **P(E|H)**: High. Personality traits such as empathy, appreciation for hard work, and love for animals fit well with students in this field.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Moderate. Some traits might still be found generally in other fields.

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Moderate. Itâ€™s a common graduate field, but less directly aligned with his specific interests in nature and animals.
- **P(E|H)**: Moderate. High intelligence and problem-solving skills align, but other traits like empathy and animal love are less directly relevant.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: High. Given the broad nature of CS, many students might still exhibit high intelligence and problem-solving skills.

Now let's assign some rough but reasonable approximate values to these probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 
  {
    "P(H)": 0.15,
    "P(E|H)": 0.80,
    "P(E|\neg H)": 0.35
  },
  "computer science": 
  {
    "P(H)": 0.20,
    "P(E|H)": 0.55,
    "P(E|\neg H)": 0.45
  }
}

Using these values, let's calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]
Assuming \( P(E) \) normalizes to a constant, we simply compare relative terms:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.12 \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.55 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]
Assuming \( P(E) \) normalizes to a constant, we simply compare relative terms:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.11 \]

Based on these relative values, Adam is slightly more likely to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Computer Science given his personality traits:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.52, 
  "computer science": 0.48
}

These values are proportional and approximate, informing us that while Computer Science is possible, Agricultural and Veterinary Science is a slightly better fit for Adam's personality sketch.
