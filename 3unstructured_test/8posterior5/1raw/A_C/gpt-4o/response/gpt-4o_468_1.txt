Let's use Bayes' rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \) for both fields. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To apply this formula, we'll make some reasonable estimations for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). We'll denote the field as \( H \) being the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in that field:

### For Computer Science

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**: Knowing that computer science is a popular field, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood**: Computer science students can have a high intelligence and can be good at solving puzzles, but having a deep love for animals, a warm heart, and curiosity about nature is less typical. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood of Evidence if Not in Computer Science**: Given Adam's characteristics, they might be more common in fields closer to nature, like agricultural sciences. We'll assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

4. **P(E) - Evidence Probability**: 
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ = 0.02 + 0.24 \]
\[ = 0.26 \]

5. **P(H|E) - Posterior Probability**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**: This field is less common than computer science, but fits Adam’s characteristics closely. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood**: The personality traits match well with this field: love for animals, curiosity about nature, strong empathy, etc. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H) - Likelihood of Evidence if Not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given this field is a close match, it’s less likely these characteristics match other fields as well. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

4. **P(E) - Evidence Probability**:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.25 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ = 0.07 + 0.225 \]
\[ = 0.295 \]

5. **P(H|E) - Posterior Probability**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.295} = \frac{0.07}{0.295} \approx 0.237 \]

### Summary

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.237
}
```

These posterior probabilities indicate it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science given his personality and interests.
