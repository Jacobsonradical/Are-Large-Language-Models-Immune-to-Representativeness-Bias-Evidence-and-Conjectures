To evaluate the probability that Adam was enrolled in either "computer science" or "agricultural and veterinary science" based on his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where: 
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that Adam’s personality sketch fits given that he was enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

Let's denote:
- \( H_{\text{CS}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{\text{AgVet}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

First, let's estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) and \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \):
- Assuming there are many graduate fields and without specific data, we might equally apportion the prior probabilities. But, given the multitude of students in computer science fields, we might reasonably consider \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) to be slightly higher.

To simplify calculations, let's assume:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.1 \)

Now estimate \( P(E|H) \):
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Given Adam’s curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and solving puzzles, but also high intelligence and abstract thinking skills, this might be moderate.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \).

- \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Given Adam’s personality traits aligning closely with agricultural and veterinary science, this probability is high.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.8 \).

Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \):
- Because the description fits better with agricultural and veterinary science, we assume that the probability of the personality sketch in other fields might be lower.
  - In the absence of these specific fields, a general assumption might place \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \) around 0.2 and \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \) around 0.3.

Given these constraints, let's ignore the exact \( P(E) \) value since it influences both fields equally and simplifies Bayesian proportion comparisons.

Now use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{\sum_H (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + \sum_{\neg H} (P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H))} \]

But for a simpler proportionality approach:
- For computer science:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
  \]

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
  \]

Thus, proportionally:
- computer science
  \[
  P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = 0.08
  \]

- agricultural and veterinary science
  \[
  P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = 0.08
  \]

Given our assumptions and simplifications, these hypothetical values might intuitively approximate:
 
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
