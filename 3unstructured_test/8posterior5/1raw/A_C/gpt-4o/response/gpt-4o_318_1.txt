To compute the probabilities, we need to assess each component of Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For this purpose:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch E.

Given that Bayes' rule proportionally adjusts the likelihoods, we do not need the value for \( P(E) \) directly to compare the fields.

Let's assign the hypothetical values after discussing the reasoning for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
   - \( P(H1) \): Graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science are fewer compared to more common fields like computer science.
   - \( P(E|H1) \): The personality sketch fits very well with this field. Curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work all align.
   - \( P(E|\neg H1) \): There are many fields unrelated to agricultural and veterinary science where such a personality might be found, but let's assume moderately likely.

2. **Computer Science (H2)**
   - \( P(H2) \): Computer science is a very common field for graduate students.
   - \( P(E|H2) \): Some aspects (intelligence, solving puzzles) fit, but the strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature might not align as well specifically.
   - \( P(E|\neg H2) \): Many other fields would fit the given personality characteristics similarly well or better.

Now, we assign values in a consistent manner:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
   - \( P(H1) \approx 0.10 \) (10% prior probability that a random graduate student is in this field)
   - \( P(E|H1) \approx 0.60 \) (The personality sketch matches quite well)
   - \( P(E|\neg H1) \approx 0.30 \) (Moderately common personality traits across other fields)

2. **Computer Science (H2)**
   - \( P(H2) \approx 0.30 \) (30% prior probability that a random graduate student is in this field)
   - \( P(E|H2) \approx 0.20 \) (Some fit, but generally less alignment)
   - \( P(E|\neg H2) \approx 0.40 \) (Commonality of these traits in non-CS fields)

Using these hypothetical values:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1):**
  \[
  P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)}
  \]

- **Computer Science (H2):**
  \[
  P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.30}{P(E)}
  \]

We only need the ratio for comparison:

\[
\frac{P(H1|E)}{P(H2|E)} = \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.10}{0.20 \cdot 0.30} = \frac{0.06}{0.06} = 1
\]

Thus, based on this hypothetical scenario (with simplifications):

\[
P(H1|E) \approx \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.10}{0.18} \approx 0.333
\]
\[
P(H2|E) \approx \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.30}{0.18} \approx 0.333
\]

Both fields end up having similar posteriors due to our assumptions. The key is the relative values to express a coherent conclusion. Here is the resulting comparison:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.333,
  "computer science": 0.333
}
