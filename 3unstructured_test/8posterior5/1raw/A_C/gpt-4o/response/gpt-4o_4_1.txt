To evaluate \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of agricultural and veterinary science and computer science, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in a certain field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the evidence, which can be decomposed as:
  \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Assumptions:
- Let's assume a prior probability \( P(H) \) is similar for both fields for simplicity. Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for both fields since there are many possible graduate fields.
- For \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), we assess how well the personality sketch fits typically expected characteristics for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H):** 
   - Prior: \( P(\text{H}) = 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H):**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
   - These traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - We estimate \( P(E|H) \) high, say \( 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):**
   - The likelihood of having such traits but not being in agricultural and veterinary science is lower.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as \( 0.2 \).

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):**
   - Prior: \( P(\text{H}) = 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H):**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has a high intelligence, and good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - These traits can be found in computer science students.
   - We estimate \( P(E|H) \), say \( 0.5 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):**
   - The likelihood of having such traits associated with computer science but not being in that field is moderately high.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as \( 0.4 \).

### Calculate \( P(E) \)

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's simplify and calculate for each hypothesis.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.308 \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 + 0.36 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.41 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.41} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.41} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.122 \]

Therefore, our estimate is:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308,
  "computer science": 0.122
