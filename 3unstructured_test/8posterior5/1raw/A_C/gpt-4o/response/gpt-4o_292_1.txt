To determine P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H) for each hypothesis. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H)**
   - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field. Considering the general distribution of graduate fields, let's estimate this around 0.10 (assuming a realistic distribution among many fields).
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality characteristics given that he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, empathy for animals, and love for plants, this field is highly probable. Let's estimate this to be around 0.70.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality if he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Considering there are many fields where these traits could be beneficial but perhaps less strongly correlated, let’s estimate this to be around 0.20.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We are interested in the ratio rather than the absolute value, so let's calculate P(H|E) up to a proportional constant for comparison purposes.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science (H)**
   - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field. Given the popularity of computer science, let's estimate this around 0.20.
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing his personality characteristics given that he is in Computer Science. Given that computer science requires high intelligence and ability to solve puzzles which aligns with Adam's skills, but may not be as strongly connected to his love for nature and animals, let’s estimate this to be around 0.50.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality if he is not in Computer Science. Given our earlier assumptions, this might be around 0.30 given the broad scope of other fields. 

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We compare these estimates up to a proportional constant:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]

To simplify, we won’t need the exact value of P(E) since it affects both hypotheses equally. We'll only compare the numerators.

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.70 \cdot 0.10 = 0.07 \]

**For Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.50 \cdot 0.20 = 0.10 \]

Given these calculations, we can now normalize to ensure they are relative to each other. 

Here’s the relative probability for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.07",
  "computer science": "0.10"
}
Thus, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science than Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on the provided personality sketch.
