To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, for simplicity, since we won't be calculating the exact value of \(P(E)\), we will compare the relative values of \(P(H|E)\) for each field.

First, let's assign plausible values for \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) based on the personality sketch provided, for each field.

### Computer Science
1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
    - Since computer science is a popular graduate field, let's assign a moderate probability: **0.2**
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was in computer science.
    - The traits described (curious, enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understands abstract concepts) fit well with a computer science background: **0.7**
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not in computer science.
    - The traits are somewhat common but perhaps less so in other fields: **0.4**

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - It's a less common field compared to computer science. We'll assign a lower prior: **0.05**
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - The traits of being curious about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals are very fitting: **0.9**
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - These traits are less specific and could apply to various fields: **0.5**

Now by simplifying Bayes' rule (since \(P(E)\) is a constant for comparison):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We can now calculate the relative probabilities.

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.2 = 0.14 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.05 = 0.045 \]

Normalizing these values (considering that we might have other fields that sum up to \(1\) for simplicity):

Let's denote our answers in a JSON-like structure:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.14,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045
}
```

These probabilities suggest that while Adam's personality is more likely indicative of enrollment in computer science, the probability of him being in agricultural and veterinary science is also feasible but considerably lower.

*Note*: These values are illustrative and based on simple assumptions. Exact values would require more detailed prior probabilities and conditional probabilities derived from empirical data.
