To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are considering only two fields, let's assume \( P(E) \) is the same for both (as it is just a normalization factor that doesn't change the comparative values significantly).

Let's start with the hypotheses:

- \( H_{{\text{CS}}} \): Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
- \( H_{{\text{AgriVet}}} \): Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Denote the following probabilities:

- \( P(H_{{\text{CS}}}) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
- \( P(E|H_{{\text{CS}}}) \): Likelihood that the evidence (personality sketch) matches if Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
- \( P(H_{{\text{AgriVet}}}) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- \( P(E|H_{{\text{AgriVet}}}) \): Likelihood that the evidence matches if Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood that the evidence does not match the given field.

Initial Priors \(P(H)\):
Assume these are generic and independent of Adam:

- \(P(H_{{\text{CS}}})\): Let's assume a prior of 0.2 (20% chance) that Adam was a CS student based on the popularity of the field.
- \(P(H_{{\text{AgriVet}}})\): Assume a prior of 0.05 (5%) because it's less common but relevant given his interests.

Now, we assess the likelihoods:

- \(P(E|H_{{\text{CS}}})\): The personality sketch does not particularly match a typical CS student profile. Thus, we might give it a lower likelihood of 0.1.
- \(P(E|H_{{\text{AgriVet}}})\): The personality sketch highly matches this field. Thus, we might assign it a high likelihood of 0.8.

We can normalize these probabilities since they don't necessarily need to add up to 1 in isolation given they are conditional:

To avoid doing full Bayesian normalization for simplicity, let's use crude estimates to rank these fields by the given evidence.

Using Bayes' rule for each field:

\[ P(H_{{\text{CS}}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{{\text{CS}}}) \cdot P(H_{{\text{CS}}})}{P(E|H_{{\text{CS}}}) \cdot P(H_{{\text{CS}}}) + P(E|H_{{\text{AgriVet}}}) \cdot P(H_{{\text{AgriVet}}})} \]

\[ P(H_{{\text{AgriVet}}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{{\text{AgriVet}}}) \cdot P(H_{{\text{AgriVet}}})}{P(E|H_{{\text{CS}}}) \cdot P(H_{{\text{CS}}}) + P(E|H_{{\text{AgriVet}}}) \cdot P(H_{{\text{AgriVet}}})} \]

Calculate:

For CS:
\[ P(H_{{\text{CS}}}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.8 \times 0.05} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.04} = \frac{0.02}{0.06} = 0.333 \]

For AgriVet:
\[ P(H_{{\text{AgriVet}}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.8 \times 0.05} = \frac{0.04}{0.02 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.06} = 0.667 \]

Thus, our probability estimates based on this approach are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.333,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.667
}
