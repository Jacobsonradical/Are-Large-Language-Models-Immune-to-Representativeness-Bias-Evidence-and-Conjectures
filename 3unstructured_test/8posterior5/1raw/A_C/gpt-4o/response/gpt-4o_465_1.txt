Sure, to calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for both fields, we'll focus on the proportionality form:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**1. Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.1 \]
The reason is that fewer students generally enroll in agricultural and veterinary science compared to other fields. This is an approximate estimate.

**2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
\[ P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.9 \]
Adam's characteristics closely fit the profile of someone in the agricultural and veterinary science field, given his love for nature and animals, his empathy, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication.

**3. Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.3 \]
Since many fields don't align as well with Adam's personality sketch, the probability that such a specific description would fit someone not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower.

### Computer Science

**1. Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \]
A significant portion of graduate students are enrolled in computer science, making this a relatively common field.

**2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4 \]
Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence match a typical profile for a computer science student. However, other aspects such as empathy, love for animals, and an understanding of hard work may not align as strongly.

**3. Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4 \]
Given the broad nature of Adam's personality sketch, itâ€™s reasonably likely that this description could fit students in a variety of non-computer science fields.

### Computing Posterior Probabilities

Now we can compare the relative probabilities (since \( P(E) \) is constant and will cancel out when comparing \( P(H|E) \)):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

After comparing these relative values:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.12
}
```

This suggests that, given Adam's description, it is slightly more likely that he is in computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary science, although both are reasonable possibilities.
