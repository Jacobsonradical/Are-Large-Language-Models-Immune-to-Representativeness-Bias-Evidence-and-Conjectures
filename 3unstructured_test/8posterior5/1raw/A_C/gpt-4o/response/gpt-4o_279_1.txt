To estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

But since \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of the evidence) is common for both hypotheses under consideration, we can compare the two posterior probabilities without calculating \( P(E) \). Let's denote the hypotheses and calculate the necessary components:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( H = \text{Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science} \)
    - \( \neg H = \text{Adam was NOT enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science} \)

2. **Computer Science**:
    - \( H = \text{Adam was enrolled in computer science} \)
    - \( \neg H = \text{Adam was NOT enrolled in computer science} \)

For this task, we'll need to estimate the following probabilities based on the given personality sketch \( E \):
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given enrollment in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given non-enrollment in the field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) \): Let's assume the probability of students enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate compared to other fields; approximately 0.1 (itâ€™s a niche field).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, empathy, and love for animals, this probability should be high, around 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \): Among other fields, the traits outlined are less common than in agricultural sciences but still present, approximately 0.3.

### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): Higher enrollment probability due to the popularity and demand for computer science studies, around 0.2.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): Considering Adam's intelligence and knack for solving puzzles, this probability is moderate, around 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \): Given the general presence of these traits in other fields, especially analytical skills like solving puzzles, it could be around 0.5.

### Applying Bayes' Theorem

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{agri}})} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.27} = \frac{0.07}{0.34} \approx 0.206 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{cs}})} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.4} = \frac{0.08}{0.48} \approx 0.167 \]

Thus, our answers would be:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.206",
  "computer science": "0.167"
}
