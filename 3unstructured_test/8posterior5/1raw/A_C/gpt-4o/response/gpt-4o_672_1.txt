To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam has the given personality traits if he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam has the given personality traits if he is not enrolled in that field.

Bayesâ€™ Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses, we can work with the following proportionality for comparison:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Assumptions and Reasoning

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work, which aligns well with this field.
- **Computer Science:** Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which align well with this field.

We also need rough estimates for the priors. Let's assume, based on national statistics and common trends among graduate students, that:

- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.2 \)

And then estimating the likelihoods:

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) (highly likely given the traits)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) (less likely but the traits still have some commonality)

- For **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \) (somewhat likely given the problem-solving and intelligence)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

### Calculations

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

#### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]

To compare the probabilities relative to each other:

\[ \text{Total} = 0.08 + 0.1 = 0.18 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.08}{0.18} \approx 0.44 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.1}{0.18} \approx 0.56 \]

Since we're asked to provide values between 0 and 1 without worrying about normalization in relation to other fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.44,
  "computer science": 0.56
}
```

These values reflect the relative probabilities that Adam is enrolled in each field given his personality sketch.
