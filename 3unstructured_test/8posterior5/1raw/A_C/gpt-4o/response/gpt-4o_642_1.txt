To estimate the probabilities required for applying Bayes' rule, we need to make educated guesses based on Adam's personality sketch and the general characteristics of the graduate fields in question.

Given:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in the specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in the specific field.
- \( P(H|E) \): Posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specific field given his personality sketch.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)_AGRI**: Prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, this field seems plausible. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.2.

- **P(E|H)_AGRI**: The probability of Adam having his personality traits if he is in this field. Given the relevance of his interests in nature and animals, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.8.

- **P(E|\neg H)_AGRI**: The probability of Adam having his personality traits if he is not in this field. Since his interests can be fairly common but are particularly apt for this field, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

\[ P(H|E)_AGRI = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E)_AGRI = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E)_AGRI = \frac{0.16}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H|E)_AGRI = 0.4 \]

### 2. Computer Science

- **P(H)_CS**: Prior probability of Adam being in computer science. Given his intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, this field also seems plausible. Letâ€™s estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.2.

- **P(E|H)_CS**: The probability of Adam having his personality traits if he is in this field. His traits align moderately well with this field (especially intelligence and puzzle-solving), but perhaps less so than the agricultural field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.6.

- **P(E|\neg H)_CS**: The probability of Adam having his personality traits if he is not in this field, which remains 0.3 as the traits could still apply to other fields. Let's maintain \( P(E|\neg H) \) at 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E)_CS = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E)_CS = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E)_CS = \frac{0.12}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E)_CS = 0.333 \]

Here are the final values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.333
}
```

These values indicate that, based on the given personality sketch, Adam is slightly more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science, but both remain plausible fields of study for him.
