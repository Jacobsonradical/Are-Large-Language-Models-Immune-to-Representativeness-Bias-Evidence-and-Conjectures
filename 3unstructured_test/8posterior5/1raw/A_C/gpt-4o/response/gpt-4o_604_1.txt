To answer this question, let's start by making some estimations for each of the probabilities and then use Bayes' Rule to compute the desired values.

**Definitions of the probabilities:**

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field given his personality sketch, computed by Bayes' Rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \). However, because we don't have the absolute value of \( P(E) \), we will only compute the relative probabilities.

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

- \( P(H) \) (prior): Let's assume 0.05, considering it's not among the most common fields but quite relevant for someone with an interest in nature and animals.
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood): Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, this value should be high. Let's set it at 0.9.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (unlikely case): Given that nature and animals are a significant part of Adam's traits, this value should be lower compared to \( P(E|H) \). Let's set it at 0.3.

**2. Computer Science:**

- \( P(H) \) (prior): Let's assume 0.2, considering it's a very popular field among graduate students in the U.S.
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood): Given Adam's high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding abstract concepts, this value should be moderately high. We will set it at 0.6.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (unlikely case): Given the broad nature of traits, this value could still be considerable but not as high as for \( P(E|H) \). Let's set it at 0.4.

### Calculating \( P(H|E) \):

Using Bayes' Rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E)_{agric} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agric} \approx \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \]

**For Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} \approx \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]

Thus, given the larger numerator for computer science, we intuitively know \( P(H|E) \) is larger for CS compared to agricultural and veterinary science, even without knowing \( P(E) \).

### Relative Probabilities:

Now normalizing these values so they sum up to 1 in terms of relative likelihoods:

\[ P(H|E)_{total} = \frac{0.045}{P(E)} + \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]
\[ = 0.045 + 0.12 = 0.165 \]

Normalizing:

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E)_{agric} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.165} \approx 0.27 \]

**For Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.165} \approx 0.73 \]

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.27,
  "computer science": 0.73
}
```

These values are indicative probabilities based on our estimations of the priors, likelihoods, and the traits described in the personality sketch.
