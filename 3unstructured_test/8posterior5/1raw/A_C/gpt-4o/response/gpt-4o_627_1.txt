To evaluate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for Adam being enrolled in computer science and agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

This equation demonstrates how to update our beliefs about \( H \) (the hypothesis) after gathering evidence \( E \).

Let's denote the two hypotheses:
1. \( H_{CS} \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( H_{AVS} \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

### For Computer Science:

1. **P(H_{CS})**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is moderate, considering the high demand for this field and the high intelligence required is consistent with his description.
   - Let's assume \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).

2. **P(E|H_{CS})**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science:
   - Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and interest in puzzles align well with the skills needed in computer science, though his specific interest in nature is less directly connected.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H_{CS})**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is NOT in computer science:
   - Since his traits can be broadly distributed across many fields (including other STEM fields), let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.25 \).

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **P(H_{AVS})**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science:
   - Given his deep love for animals and curiosity about nature, this seems quite plausible for his interests.
   - Let's assume \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H_{AVS})**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science:
   - His traits closely align with the typical interests and skills for this field.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.7 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H_{AVS})**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is NOT in agricultural and veterinary science:
   - While his traits are less strongly predictive of fields other than agricultural and veterinary science or related natural sciences, they can still be found elsewhere.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.3 \).

### Using Bayes' Rule:

**For Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Given simplified form of \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.25 \cdot 0.7 = 0.12 + 0.175 = 0.295 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.295} = \frac{0.12}{0.295} \approx 0.407 \]


**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AVS}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38 \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.38} = \frac{0.14}{0.38} \approx 0.368 \]

### Final Probabilities:
