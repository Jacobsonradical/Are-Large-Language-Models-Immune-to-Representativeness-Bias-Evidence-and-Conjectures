To determine \( P(H \mid E) \) for each field of study given the personality sketch of Adam, we'll use Bayes' rule. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the fields "computer science" and "agricultural and veterinary science," we'll need to estimate:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E \mid H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in that field.
3. \( P(E \mid \neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in that field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Since \( P(E) \) should be the sum of the probabilities of \( E \) given every possible field Adam could be enrolled in, which we don't explicitly have, we'll focus on the ratios provided by Bayes' rule and assume it constitutes a proxy for recalculating the relevant posteriors across our given fields.

### Analysis for Each Field

#### Computer Science
- **\( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being a computer science graduate student is 0.2 (20%).
- **\( P(E \mid H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and solving puzzles:
  - Empathy and deep love for animals are somewhat less typical for computer science but high intelligence and appreciation for abstract concepts are fitting. Assign \( P(E \mid H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \) (30%).
- **\( P(E \mid \neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Let's assume the probability of observing the personality sketch given he's not in computer science (as a weighted average across other fields) is about \( 0.05 \) (5%).

Using Bayes:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} \mid E) \propto \frac{P(E \mid H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{\text{Normalization factor}} \approx 0.06 /\text{Normalization factor} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)**: Assume the prior probability is higher for someone with an apparent affinity for nature and animals, say 0.4 (40%).
- **\( P(E \mid H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)**: This field strongly aligns with Adam’s love for animals, nature, and empathy (which is expected in this field). Assign \( P(E \mid H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.7 \) (70%).
- **\( P(E \mid \neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)**: This would be a catch-all for fields not fitting his description, which may be lower, say 0.03 (3%).

Using Bayes:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}} \mid E) \propto \frac{P(E \mid H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.4}{\text{Normalization factor}} \approx 0.28 /\text{Normalization factor} \]

### Calculation
Since the normalization factor \( P(E) \) will be the same for both fields, we compute the proportional values and then normalize them proportionally for comparison.

Using these ratios, we get the two values:
- Computer Science: ≈ 0.06
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: ≈ 0.28

The normalized probabilities should offer a more comparable metric, so:

{
  "computer science": "0.18",  //(0.06 / (0.06 + 0.28))
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.82"   //(0.28 / (0.06 + 0.28))
}
