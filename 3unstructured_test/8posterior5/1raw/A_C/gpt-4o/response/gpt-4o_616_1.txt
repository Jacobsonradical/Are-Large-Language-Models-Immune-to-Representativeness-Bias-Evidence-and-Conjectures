Let's compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in each of the given fields using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the sake of simplicity, let's assume prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihood values \( P(E|H) \) based on the personality sketch provided:

1. **Computer Science**: 

   - **P(H)**: Not very high, as there's no specific indication of Adam having an interest in programming or computing technology.
   \[ P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.1 \]

   - **P(E|H)**: While it includes problem-solving, the personality sketch leans more towards nature, animals, and empathy, which aren't central to most computer science programs.
   \[ P(E|\text{H}_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \]

   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, animals, and plants, this needs to account for all other possible fields. Let's assume the complementary likelihood is moderate since his skills could fit various non-CS fields well.
   \[ P(E | \neg \text{H}_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.6 \]

   Plugging these values into Bayes' formula:
   \[ P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.6 \times 0.9} \]
   \[ P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.54} \]
   \[ P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.56} \approx 0.036 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

   - **P(H)**: Higher, given his deep love for animals and nature.
   \[ P(\text{H}_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.4 \]

   - **P(E|H)**: Very high, since his interests align perfectly with this field.
   \[ P(E|\text{H}_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.9 \]

   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Assuming the complementary likelihood to reflect all other fields that might not perfectly match his interests.
   \[ P(E | \neg \text{H}_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.3 \]

   Plugging these values into Bayes' formula:
   \[ P(\text{H}_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.4}{0.9 \times 0.4 + 0.3 \times 0.6} \]
   \[ P(\text{H}_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.36}{0.36 + 0.18} \]
   \[ P(\text{H}_{\text{AVS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.36}{0.54} \approx 0.667 \]

Thus, the result in the requested format is as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.036,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.667
}
