Let's go through the calculations step by step.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.**
   - Since we don't have specific prior information about Adam's choice, let's assume an arbitrary probability for the sake of calculation. Let's assume P(H) = 0.2.

2. **P(E|H): Probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was indeed studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science.**
   - Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, the evidence E fits well with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H): Probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was not studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science.**
   - The evidence could fit other fields as well, especially those related to nature, animals or complex problem-solving.
   - Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.4 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.**
   - Similarly, let's assume an arbitrary probability for the sake of calculation. Let's assume P(H) = 0.2.

2. **P(E|H): Probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was indeed studying Computer Science.**
   - While Adam's intelligence and love for solving puzzles fits Computer Science, his focus on nature and animals might not be as strong a fit.
   - Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.5.

3. **P(E|¬H): Probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was not studying Computer Science.**
   - Since the evidence fits science-related fields more than average, let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.4.

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{1}{4.2} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.24 \]
