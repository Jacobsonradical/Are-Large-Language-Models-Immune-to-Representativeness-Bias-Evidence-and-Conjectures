To calculate the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the likelihood for the complement \(P(E|\neg H)\). We can use the following formula for Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, let's assign some reasonable estimates to the probabilities:

**Computer Science:**

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):**
    - P(H): The probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
    - Let's assign a mid-range value based on general enrollment rates, say 0.3 (30%).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):**
    - Given Adam's personality fits some but not all personality traits of a typical computer science student (e.g., good at solving puzzles, high intelligence but a stronger emphasis on natural curiosity and empathy for animals than typically associated with computer science majors).
    - Let's assign a value of 0.2 (20%).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\):**
    - The probability of observing Adam's traits, given he wasn't enrolled in Computer Science.
    - Let's say 0.5 (50%) since these traits are generally quite broad and can fit many fields.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):**
    - P(H): The probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
    - Let's assign a lower but plausible probability based on general enrollment rates, say 0.1 (10%).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):**
    - Adam's interests and empathy closely align with this field, making these traits highly likely.
    - Let's assign a high probability, say 0.8 (80%).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\):**
    - The probability of observing Adam's traits if he wasn't enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
    - Again, let's say 0.5 (50%).

Now, let's calculate \(P(H|E)\) for both fields using these assumptions:

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{(0.2 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot 0.7)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.41} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.146 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{(0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.45} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.53} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.151 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for both fields are:

{
  "computer science": 0.146,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.151
}
