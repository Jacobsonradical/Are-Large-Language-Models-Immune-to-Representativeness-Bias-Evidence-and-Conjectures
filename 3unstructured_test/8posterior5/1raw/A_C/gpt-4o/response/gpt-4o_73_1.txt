Let's break down the probabilities for each field according to Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field (computer science or agricultural and veterinary science).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing E (Adam's personality sketch) given that he was enrolled in a given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing E given that he was not enrolled in the given field.
4. \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing E, which can be found using the Law of Total Probability.

Since we ultimately need to compare \( P(H|E) \) for both fields, we can ignore the exact value of \( P(E) \) because it will be the same for both fields and thus will cancel out when comparing them. Here's the estimation:

### For Computer Science

1. **P(H)**:
   - Given that computer science is a common graduate field, let's assume a prior probability of about 0.15.

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - Some characteristics (high intelligence, problem-solving skills) fit well with computer science. However, deep love for animals and appreciation for nature might be less common.
   - Let's estimate this at 0.2.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   - Since there are many fields outside computer science, which may align with Adam's personality, let's assume a higher value. 
   - Let's estimate this at 0.3.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = 0.03 / P(E) \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**:
   - This field is less common than computer science but more aligned with Adam's traits. Let's assume a prior of about 0.05.

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - Adam's personality traits (love for animals, nature, and appreciation for hard work) fit very well here.
   - Let's estimate this at 0.7.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   - Fewer fields outside this would align perfectly with Adam's personality. 
   - Let's estimate this at 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = 0.035 / P(E) \]

### Result

After calculating practical comparisons, we see that:

- Computer Science: \(\frac{0.03}{P(E)}\)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \(\frac{0.035}{P(E)}\)

Therefore, \( P(H|E) \) is higher for Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Computer Science. Normalizing the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.462,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.538
