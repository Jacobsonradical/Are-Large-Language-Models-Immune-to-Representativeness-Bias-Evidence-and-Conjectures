To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to set up the probabilities as follows:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given the personality sketch.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't need the total to add up to 1 and considering the complexities in the exact values for \( P(E) \), I'll focus on relative comparisons.

### Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
- Let's assume a reasonable distribution of fields among graduate students.
- Given no specific background data, we'll assume equal priors for simplicity: 

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}) = 0.1 \]

### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
- Adam's personality sketch fits well with agricultural and veterinary science due to his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals.
- For computer science, his traits of intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving are relevant, but the nature orientation is less fitting.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \]

### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):
This is harder to quantify without additional data, but we'll assume the general attribute fit based on other fields. We'll consider a base rate that these traits are moderately likely in graduate fields.

- For simplicity, assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is approximately the same because multiple other fields might share similar traits; let's say:
\[ P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.2 \]

### Calculation Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For simplicity in relative comparisons:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04 \]

### Normalization (if total needed in context):
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.04} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.08 + 0.04} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]

### Final Fireld specific Probabilities:
For context-wise approximate results considering other fields:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.04
}
```
The values indicate a relatively higher chance that Adam might be in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, given his personality sketch. Overall, the absolute values suggest higher assertions per context without normalized measures.
