To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science given the personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

We need to assess the following probabilities for both fields:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \):** The probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is not specifically known but let's assume a moderate prior since it is a specialized field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \):** Adam's characteristics align well with this fieldâ€”curiosity about nature, love for animals, appreciation for hard work. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) should be high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** The likelihood of Adam's characteristics if he is not in this field might be lower. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \):** The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science could be higher due to the general popularity of the field among graduate students. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \):** While Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills align with computer science, his strong empathy and love for animals do not particularly match. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) might be moderate. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** The probability of Adam's characteristics if he is not in computer science might be slightly higher given that a portion of these skills and traits are transferable but not specific to computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

### Calculating \( P(H|E) \)

The total probability \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[
P(H) = 0.1
\]
\[
P(\neg H) = 0.9
\]
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.34} = \frac{0.07}{0.34} \approx 0.206
\]

**For Computer Science:**

\[
P(H) = 0.3
\]
\[
P(\neg H) = 0.7
\]
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7 = 0.12 + 0.35 = 0.47
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.47} = \frac{0.12}{0.47} \approx 0.255
\]

Therefore, the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the specified fields given his personality sketch are as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.206,
  "computer science": 0.255
}
