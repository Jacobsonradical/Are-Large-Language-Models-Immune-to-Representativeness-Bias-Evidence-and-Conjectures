To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field of study given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's denote:
- \( H_{\text{AVS}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_{\text{CS}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Since we don't have the exact values for prior probabilities or likelihoods, we'll have to make reasonable assumptions based on the given data.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H_{\text{AVS}}):** Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, there's a relatively higher prior probability.
   Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}):** Adam's characteristics align very well with this field.
   Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}):** The probability of the sketch appearing if Adam was not in agricultural and veterinary science seems lower.
   Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.3 \).

### Computer Science

1. **P(H_{\text{CS}}):** Computer science is a very common graduate field, and Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills fit this field well.
   Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \).

2. **P(E|H_{\text{CS}}):** While Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving fit, his empathy and love for nature may be less common in this field.
   Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}):** The probability of the sketch appearing if Adam was in some other field also seems moderate.
   Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \).

We calculate \( P(H|E) \):

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.16 + 0.24 = 0.4 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = \frac{0.16}{0.4} = 0.4 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.15 + 0.28 = 0.43 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.43} = \frac{0.15}{0.43} \approx 0.35 \]

Final Answer:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
