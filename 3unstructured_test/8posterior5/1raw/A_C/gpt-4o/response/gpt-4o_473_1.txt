To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "computer science" given his personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the exact statistics, we'll make educated estimates based on the personality sketch and the typical characteristics and interests of students in these fields. 

Let’s denote:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

We'll estimate the following probabilities based on common sense:

1. **Base Rates \( P(H) \)**: These are rough estimates of the probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in a particular field.

   \[
   \begin{align*}
   P(H_1) &= 0.05 \quad \text{(5% of graduate students might be in agricultural and veterinary science)} \\
   P(H_2) &= 0.10 \quad \text{(10% of graduate students might be in computer science)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**: These represent how likely Adam's personality sketch aligns with someone in each field.

   - For \( H_1 \) (agricultural and veterinary science):
     \[
     P(E|H_1) = 0.7 \quad \text{(High likelihood given Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy)}
     \]

   - For \( H_2 \) (computer science):
     \[
     P(E|H_2) = 0.3 \quad \text{(Lower likelihood but possible due to Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills)}
     \]

3. **Complementary Likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: These represent the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch aligns with graduate students not in each field.

   \[
   \begin{align*}
   P(E|\neg H_1) &= 0.5 \quad \text{(Moderate likelihood given the general alignment of Adam's personality with other fields)} \\
   P(E|\neg H_2) &= 0.6 \quad \text{(Higher likelihood given the prevalence of abstract thinking and intelligence in other fields)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

To apply Bayes' rule, we need the overall probability \( P(E) \). Since this isn't provided, we’ll use the law of total probability for an estimate. However, for simplicity, we'll focus on calculating the relative values of \( P(H_1|E) \) and \( P(H_2|E) \) as it’s more insightful for comparison:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_1|E) &= \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1)} \\
P(H_2|E) &= \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_2) \cdot P(\neg H_2)} 
\end{align*}
\]

Calculating these:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_1|E) &= \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.475} = \frac{0.035}{0.51} \approx 0.0686 \\
P(H_2|E) &= \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.10}{0.3 \cdot 0.10 + 0.6 \cdot 0.90} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.54} = \frac{0.03}{0.57} \approx 0.0526
\end{align*}
\]

So, the comparative probabilities are:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_1|E) &\approx 0.0686 \\
P(H_2|E) &\approx 0.0526
\end{align*}
\]

This translates into the following answer:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.0686,
  "computer science": 0.0526
}
