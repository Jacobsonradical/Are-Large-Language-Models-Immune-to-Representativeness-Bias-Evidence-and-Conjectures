Sure, let's use Bayes' Rule to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch.

Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplification, we can express the rule in terms of the two fields provided.

Given:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) denotes the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H_{AV}) \) denotes the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) denotes the probability of the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{AV}) \) denotes the probability of the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \) denotes the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \) denotes the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's assume:
- \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.1 \) (10% chance to begin with that he is studying computer science, based on the general distribution of students in various fields)
- \( P(H_{AV}) = 0.05 \) (5% chance to begin with that he is studying agricultural and veterinary science, based on the general distribution of students in various fields)
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.2 \) (assuming the personality traits are moderately consistent with computer science students)
- \( P(E|H_{AV}) = 0.8 \) (assuming the personality traits are highly consistent with agricultural and veterinary science students)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AV}) = 0.2 \)

We'll use these to find the normalized probabilities \( P(H_{CS}|E) \) and \( P(H_{AV}|E) \):

1. Calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \\
P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.1 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.09 = 0.11 \\
\\
P(E) = P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) + P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AV}) \\
P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23
\]

2. Apply Bayes' rule to find \( P(H_{CS}|E) \):

\[ 
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.11} ≈ 0.1818 
\]

3. Apply Bayes' rule to find \( P(H_{AV}|E) \):

\[ 
P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} ≈ 0.1739 
\]

These probabilities show the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in each field, given his personality traits. So, we can present the final result as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1818,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1739
}
```
