Sure, we can estimate the probabilities as follows:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H) (prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science):**
This generally depends on the overall distribution of graduate fields. Since Agricultural and Veterinary Science is a specialized but not uncommon field, let's assign a reasonable prior probability.
- Estimation: 0.1 (10% chance)

**P(E|H) (likelihood of observing E given H):**
Adam’s characteristics align strongly with this field: curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
- Estimation: 0.7 (70%)

**P(E|¬H) (likelihood of observing E given not H):**
Since Adam's traits are more specifically aligned with this field than many others, the likelihood that these traits describe someone not in the fields of Agricultural and Veterinary Science would be lower.
- Estimation: 0.3 (30%)

### Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]
Where,
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H) 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.07 + 0.27 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.34 
\]
Thus,
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.34} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) ≈ 0.206 (approximately) 
\]

### Computer Science

**P(H) (prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science):**
This field is very popular, and a good portion of graduate students might be enrolled in Computer Science.
- Estimation: 0.2 (20% chance)

**P(E|H) (likelihood of observing E given H):**
Some of Adam's traits, such as high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles, could be relevant to Computer Science. However, traits like love for animals and nature do not particularly fit.
- Estimation: 0.4 (40%)

**P(E|¬H) (likelihood of observing E given not H):**
Since traits like love for animals and nature are not aligned with Computer Science specifically, many graduate students not in Computer Science might still display similar traits.
- Estimation: 0.4 (40%)

### Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]
Where,
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H) 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.8) 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.08 + 0.32 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.4 
\]
Thus,
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.4} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) = 0.2 
\]

### Summary of posterior probabilities:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.206,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These values represent the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, given the provided personality sketch. The probabilities are based on reasoned estimates and should be adjusted if more accurate priors or likelihoods become available.
