To apply Bayesian inference and compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll need to make educated guesses about the probabilities involved. Referencing Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant that ensures the probabilities sum to 1 over all hypotheses. Though it can be calculated, we can focus on relative values to express our answers.

Given Adam's profile:

1. **P(H)**: The initial probability of Adam being in a specific field without additional information from \( E \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam is in a specific field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given Adam is not in the specific field.

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The general probability of a graduate student being in computer science might be fairly high, let's say 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Given the personality sketch emphasizing abstract thinking and puzzle-solving, these traits align well with computer science. Let’s assign a relatively high value, perhaps 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in computer science, the probability of still exhibiting these traits but being in a different field might be, say, 0.4.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The general probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower than computer science, let's say 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, these traits strongly align with this field. Let’s assign a high value, perhaps 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of still exhibiting these traits but being in a different field might be lower, say 0.2.

Applying Bayes' rule without normalization:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

- For **Computer Science**:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

So, without normalizing and focusing on the relative comparison:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.14,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
```

This way, the values give us a sense of the relative likelihood that Adam is in each field based on his personality sketch.
