Sure, let's analyze the probabilities step by step.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H): Probability Adam is enrolled in this field**  
   Since Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, and given his empathy and love for animals, it's reasonable to assume that he has a higher likelihood of being in agricultural and veterinary science than an average graduate student.  
   **Let's estimate P(H) = 0.3.**

2. **P(E|H): Probability of observing the personality sketch E, given that Adam is in this field**  
   Given Adam's traits – curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, empathy, and love for animals – it is highly probable that someone in this field would exhibit these characteristics.  
   **Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.8.**

3. **P(E|¬H): Probability of observing the personality sketch E, given that Adam is NOT in this field**  
   These traits could also be found in people from other fields, but perhaps less frequently or less directly relevant.  
   **Let's estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.3.**

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1-P(H))} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot (1-0.3)} = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.21} = \frac{0.24}{0.45} = 0.533 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H): Probability Adam is enrolled in this field**  
   Computer Science is a highly popular field, and Adam's high intelligence and abstract concept understanding match well with the traits valued in this field.  
   **Let's estimate P(H) = 0.25.**

2. **P(E|H): Probability of observing the personality sketch E, given that Adam is in this field**  
   Though it's possible to find computer scientists who appreciate nature, love animals, and have a warm heart, these traits are not as strongly associated with computer science.  
   **Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.2.**

3. **P(E|¬H): Probability of observing the personality sketch E, given that Adam is NOT in this field**  
   These characteristics are somewhat likely to be found in people outside the field of Computer Science.  
   **Let's estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.4.**

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1-P(H))} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.4 \cdot (1-0.25)} = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.3} = \frac{0.05}{0.35} = 0.143 \]

### Summary

Based on the calculated probabilities, here is the result:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.533,
