Let's assign some reasonable values to the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch (E) and the fields of study (H).

From Adam's personality sketch:

- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1):**

- P(H1): The prior probability that any given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it's 0.1 (10%).
- P(E|H1): The likelihood of Adam's personality given he is in this field. Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, this seems high. Let's assume it's 0.9 (90%).
- P(E|\neg H1): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in this field. This includes all other possible fields. Let's assume it's 0.4 (40%).

**Computer Science (H2):**

- P(H2): The prior probability that any given graduate student is in computer science. Let's assume it's 0.2 (20%).
- P(E|H2): The likelihood of Adam's personality given he is in this field. Given his high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, but lesser connection to nature and animals, let's assume it's 0.3 (30%).
- P(E|\neg H2): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in this field. This includes all other possible fields. Let's assume it's 0.7 (70%).

Using Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality, which can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E| \neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1) \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1):

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.4 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.36 = 0.45 \]

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.45} = \frac{0.09}{0.45} = 0.2 \]

For Computer Science (H2):

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.7 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.56 = 0.62 \]

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.62} = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \approx 0.097 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.097
}
