To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's consider the fields:

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\( P(H) \)** (prior probability): Let's assume the probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in this field is around 10%.
  
- **\( P(E|H) \)** (likelihood): Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, his enrollment in this field would explain his characteristics well. Let's say there is an 80% chance that Adam fits the sketch if he is in this field.

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)** (marginal likelihood of E given not H): If Adam is not in this field, the chance that he still fits this personality sketch but in another field could be reasonably assumed to be around 20%.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(Agricultural \& Veterinary Science|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### 2. Computer Science
- **\( P(H) \)** (prior probability): Given the increasing popularity of computer science, assume it at around 15%.

- **\( P(E|H) \)** (likelihood): Considering Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, he could fit well into computer science, but the strong affinity for nature and animals is less common in this field. Let's say there's a 30% chance he fits the sketch if he is in this field.

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)** (marginal likelihood of E given not H): If Adam isn't in computer science, there's still the same estimated 20% chance he fits the sketch because it applies to various other fields as well.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(Computer Science|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.3 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.17} = \frac{0.045}{0.215} \approx 0.2093 \]

So the probability estimates are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "computer science": 0.2093
}
```
