Let's break down the reasoning for each field:

### 1. **Computer Science**

**P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given that computer science is a common field for graduate students, let's assume a modest estimate: 

P(H) ≈ 0.10.

**P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is in computer science. Adam's curiosity about nature and animals seems less aligned with a computer science background, but his high intelligence and problem-solving skills are a good fit. 

P(E|H) ≈ 0.30.

**P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given Adam is NOT in computer science. Considering that many other fields could align better with his personality traits (like agricultural and veterinary science), this probability might be higher:

P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.50.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \times 0.10}{0.30 \times 0.10 + 0.50 \times 0.90} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.45} \approx 0.0625
\]

### 2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

**P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common than computer science but fits Adam's interests well. 

P(H) ≈ 0.05.

**P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this field is a strong fit:

P(E|H) ≈ 0.80.

**P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch E given Adam is NOT in agricultural and veterinary science. Since his traits align well with this field, it is less likely for someone with his traits to be found in other fields:

P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.30.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.05}{0.80 \times 0.05 + 0.30 \times 0.95} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.285} \approx 0.123
\]

Thus, the calculated posterior probabilities are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.0625,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123
}
```
