To determine \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

Given that exact values for these probabilities are not provided, I will make reasonable estimates based on Adamâ€™s personality traits and the likelihood of such traits being present in individuals within these fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: 
   Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science students is moderate among all graduate students (say 10%).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: 
   The likelihood of his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly suggests a fit. Let's assign a high value (say 0.8).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   Considering the general graduate population, such traits might be less common. Let's assign a lower value (say 0.3).

4. **\( P(E) \)**:
   This is the overall probability of the personality traits, but since we're not given other values, we'll use a normalizing constant in comparison to other fields.

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: 
   The prior probability \( P(H) \) for computer science students is perhaps higher given its popularity among graduate fields (say 20%).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: 
   High intelligence and enjoying solving puzzles fit well, but the deep love for animals and nature appreciation might be less aligned. Let's assign a moderate value (say 0.4).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   As with the prior trait analysis, we assign a lower value (say 0.3).

Let's compute the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assume \( P(E) \) is the same across different calculations for relative comparison.

Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

Normalized comparison yields:

\[ \frac{P(H|E)_{\text{agri}}}{P(H|E)_{\text{agri}} + P(H|E)_{\text{CS}}} = \frac{0.08 / P(E)}{0.08 / P(E) + 0.08 / P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{0.16} = 0.5 \]

\[ \frac{P(H|E)_{\text{CS}}}{P(H|E)_{\text{agri}} + P(H|E)_{\text{CS}}} = \frac{0.08 / P(E)}{0.08 / P(E) + 0.08 / P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{0.16} = 0.5 \]

Thus, given the assumptions and values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Due to assumptions in the absence of specific statistical data, these normalized probabilities could match. To refine this further, one would ideally need actual prior distributions and more precise information.
