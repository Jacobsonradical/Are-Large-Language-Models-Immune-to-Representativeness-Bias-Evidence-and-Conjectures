To estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, I will first make subjective assessments of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) can be represented as a weighted sum of probabilities across all hypotheses, I'll ignore the exact calculation of \( P(E) \) for the purposes of comparison. The proportional relationship will suffice since we are comparing probabilities for different fields. This is equivalent to normalizing at the end, so we can directly compare the unnormalized probabilities.

### Step-by-Step Estimation

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H):** Since computer science is a common field, let's assume a moderately high probability that any given graduate student is in this field. Let's approximate this as \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
   - **P(E|H):** Given Adam's traits like solving puzzles and high intelligence, there is a moderate likelihood he fits the profile. However, his deep love for nature and animals makes it less likely. So let's approximate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H):** For fields other than computer science, especially those related to nature and animals, let's approximate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

   Therefore, applying Bayes' rule without normalization:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E | H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H):** This is a less common field compared to computer science, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - **P(E|H):** Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, empathy, and love for animals, there is a high likelihood he fits the profile. So let's approximate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H):** For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, let's approximate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

   Therefore, applying Bayes' rule without normalization:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E | H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
   \]

### Normalization To Compare

To normalize and provide a comparison:

- For computer science: \( P(H|E) \propto 0.06 \)
- For agricultural and veterinary science: \( P(H|E) \propto 0.08 \)

Thus, based on the above calculations, here are the normalized probabilities:

\[
\text{Sum for normalization} = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14
\]

\[
P(H|E_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.429, \quad P(H|E_{\text{AgriVet}}) = \frac{0.08}{0.14} \approx 0.571
\]

So, the final values:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.429,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.571
}
\]

{
  "computer science": 0.429,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.571
}
