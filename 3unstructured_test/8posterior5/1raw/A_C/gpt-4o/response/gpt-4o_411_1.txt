To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and the same for both hypotheses, we'll only focus on the comparison:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, let's assess each term separately for the hypotheses:

### Hypothesis 1: Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability of any graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's set this at around 0.05 for simplicity.
  
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's personality fits well with agricultural and veterinary science given his love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work. Thus, we could assume \( P(E|H) \) to be relatively high. Let’s estimate it around 0.8.
  
- **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E| \neg H) \)**: The probability of the personality sketch fitting someone not in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering other fields, we might set this somewhat lower. Let's estimate around 0.2.

### Hypothesis 2: Adam was enrolled in Computer Science

- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability of any graduate student being in computer science. This number is usually higher. Let’s set this at around 0.20.
  
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam’s intelligence, love of puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, it is reasonable, but less fitting compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this around 0.5.
  
- **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of the personality sketch fitting someone not in computer science. Considering other fields, this might be equally reasonable among non-CS fields. Let's consider it around 0.3.

Now we will plug these into Bayes' rule:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]

We’ll calculate a proportional value (dropping \( P(E) \) for comparison purposes):

\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} \propto 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

#### Computer Science

Similarly:

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Proportional value:

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \propto 0.5 \times 0.20 = 0.10 \]

To sum up the final values as asked:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.10
