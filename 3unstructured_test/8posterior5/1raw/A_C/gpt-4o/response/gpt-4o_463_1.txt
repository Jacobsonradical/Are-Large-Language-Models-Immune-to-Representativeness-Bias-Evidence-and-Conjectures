To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to use the available probabilities. Bayes' rule can be stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses (computer science and agricultural and veterinary science), we can focus on the numerator of Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Computer Science

- **\( P(H) \):** This represents the prior probability that Adam could be in the field of computer science. Assuming graduate student distribution and popularity of fields, this might be moderate.
- **\( P(E|H) \):** This is the probability that the personality sketch \( E \) would exhibit given Adam is in computer science. The personality sketch suggests he enjoys nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles. While high intelligence and solving puzzles fit, the love for nature and animals fits less well.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** This represents the probability that the personality sketch would be observed in someone not in computer science.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(H) \):** This represents the prior probability that Adam could be in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
- **\( P(E|H) \):** The personality sketch fits well with agricultural and veterinary science, given his love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy.**
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** This represents the probability that the personality sketch would be observed in someone not in agricultural and veterinary science.

Now let's assign approximate values and calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis. 

### Approximate Values:
- **Computer Science:**
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) (assuming moderate popularity)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \) (somewhat fits, due to intelligence and puzzles)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.05 \) (less likely to have this nature-oriented personality outside this field)

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (assuming less popular)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) (very good fit)
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \) (some overlap with other fields involving nature)

### Calculations:
#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.3 = 0.09 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Normalizing the probabilities so they sum to 1:

Total = 0.09 (Computer Science) + 0.08 (Agricultural and Veterinary Science) = 0.17

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | E) = \frac{0.09}{0.17} \approx 0.53 \]
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) = \frac{0.08}{0.17} \approx 0.47 \]

Suspense:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.53,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.47
}
```

This estimation reflects the mixture of fitting traits in the personality sketch for both fields, with a slight inclination towards computer science considering intelligence and puzzle-solving interest, while strong empathy and nature interest boost the probability for agricultural and veterinary science.
