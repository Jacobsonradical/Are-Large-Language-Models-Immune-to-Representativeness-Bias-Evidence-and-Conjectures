To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a given field \( H \) given the evidence \( E \) (the personality sketch), we will use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood for the negation \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that any random graduate student is studying computer science. This can be estimated based on the popularities of graduate fields. Let's assume it's relatively popular, so \( P(\text{H}) = 0.2 \).
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of having the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is in computer science. While computer science students can be intelligent and good at solving puzzles, the deep love for nature, plants, and animals is less common. So let's assign this a moderate likelihood, \( P(E|\text{H}) = 0.3 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is not in computer science. This includes various other fields, many of which might align better with his traits. Thus, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that any random graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science. This field might be less common than computer science. Let's assume \( P(\text{H}) = 0.05 \).
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of having the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. This field aligns very well with his traits. Let's assign a high likelihood, \( P(E|\text{H}) = 0.9 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of having the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This is the complementary case, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Now, let's calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' Rule.

For **computer science**:
\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) = \frac{P(E | \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]

Let \( P(E) \) be the normalized constant:
\[ P(E) = P(E | \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E | \neg \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{computer science}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.48 = 0.54 \]

Then, 
\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.54} = \frac{0.06}{0.54} = 0.111 \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) = \frac{P(E | \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]

Let \( P(E) \) be the normalized constant:
\[ P(E) = P(E | \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E | \neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.4 \cdot 0.95) = 0.045 + 0.38 = 0.425 \]

Then,
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.425} = \frac{0.045}{0.425} = 0.106 \]

Hence, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.106
}
```

Keep in mind that the total does not add up to 1 because these are only two fields among many possible fields of study.
