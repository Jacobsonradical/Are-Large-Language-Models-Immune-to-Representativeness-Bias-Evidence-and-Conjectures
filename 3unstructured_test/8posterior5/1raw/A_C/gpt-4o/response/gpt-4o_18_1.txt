Sure, let's break this down systematically using Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches if he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches if he is not in that field.

Since we are considering two fields, our analysis will be relative and heuristic rather than absolute. Let's evaluate each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))
- Let's assume that a reasonable prior for someone being in agricultural and veterinary science is \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

#### Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, which aligns very well with this field.
- Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).

#### Likelihood of Evidence Given Not in the Field (\( P(E|\neg H) \))
- Assuming this describes a fairly specific set of interests, fewer graduate fields will satisfy \( E \) to the same extent.
- Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

### Computer Science

#### Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))
- Given the popularity of computer science, let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).

#### Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, which aligns well with traits often beneficial in computer science.
- Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \).

#### Likelihood of Evidence Given Not in the Field (\( P(E|\neg H) \))
- While traits like high intelligence and enjoyment in solving puzzles are somewhat common across fields, they do match well with computer science.
- Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

### Calculations using Bayes' Rule

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.1)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.07}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.28 \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.29 \]

So, the posterior probabilities that Adam is enrolled in each field given the personality sketch \( E \) are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "computer science": 0.29
}
