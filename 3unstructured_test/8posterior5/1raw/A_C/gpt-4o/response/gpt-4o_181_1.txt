To estimate the probabilities, we need to evaluate the likelihood of the given personality sketch \( E \) if Adam were enrolled in each of the proposed fields, as well as the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in those fields. The relevant equations are:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to simplify, we can focus on comparing \( P(H|E) \) without needing the exact value of \( P(E) \) since it acts as a normalizing constant across different fields. The priors \( P(H) \) should be informed by overall enrollment distributions in those fields.

### Steps:
1. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) in general, across all fields other than \( H \).
3. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.

### Assumptions:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AG-Vet)**:
  - Likes nature and plants: High
  - Solving puzzles: Moderate
  - Empathy and love for animals: Very High
  - Intelligence and abstract concepts: Moderate
  - Understanding and appreciation for hard work: High
  - Assumed \( P(E|H) \) is high due to many personality traits matching well with this field.
  - Assumed \( P(H) \) is relatively low as fewer students choose this field compared to others like computer science.

- **Computer Science (CS)**:
  - Likes nature and plants: Low
  - Solving puzzles: Very High
  - Empathy and love for animals: Low
  - Intelligence and abstract concepts: Very High
  - Understanding and appreciation for hard work: Moderate to High
  - Assumed \( P(E|H) \) is moderate due to mixed relevance of personality traits.
  - Assumed \( P(H) \) is high due to large enrollment numbers in CS.

Here's a simplified probability breakdown:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science":
    {
      "P(H)": 0.05,
      "P(E|H)": 0.35,
      "P(E|\neg H)": 0.2,
      "P(H|E)": \(\frac{0.35 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}\), which we simplify to \( \approx 0.0875 \)
    },
  "computer science":
    {
      "P(H)": 0.2,
      "P(E|H)": 0.15,
      "P(E|\neg H)": 0.2,
      "P(H|E)": \(\frac{0.15 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}\), which we simplify to \( \approx 0.15 \)
    }
}

While precise values of \( P(E) \) are unknown, we can observe that \( P(H|E) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is likely lower than computer science due to the larger enrollment and match in CS. Therefore, realistic values are as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.0875,
  "computer science": 0.15
}

Please note while these numbers give us directional guidance, precise values may differ with more exact data on overall distributions and personality trait matches.
