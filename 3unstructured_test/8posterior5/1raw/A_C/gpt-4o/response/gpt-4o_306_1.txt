To solve this problem, we'll utilize Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for Adam being enrolled in computer science and agricultural and veterinary science. We won't focus on calculating \( P(E) \) directly since it will be the same denominator for both fields and will cancel out for the relative comparison.

### Computer Science
#### Estimations
- **P(H)**: Let's assume that the prior probability of Adam being a computer science graduate student is moderate since computer science is a common field. \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).
  
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the traits given he is in computer science might be lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science due to the nature-focused aspects of his personality. While computer science students can be empathetic, curious about nature, and intelligent, it's less typical for them to have a profound love for nature and animals.  \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability Adam has the traits given he is not in computer science. Given there are many other fields where his interests fit better (like biological sciences, environmental sciences, etc.), this is high. \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.8 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### Estimations
- **P(H)**: Let's assume that the prior probability of Adam being an agricultural and veterinary science student is lower than computer science because it's a less common field. \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.05 \).

- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having these traits given he is in agricultural and veterinary science is high due to his curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with empathy and a warm heart. \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.9 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability Adam has the traits given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science, which we have already discussed as high. \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.7 \).

Now let's compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS})}
\]

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.64} = \frac{0.04}{0.68} = \frac{1}{17}
\]

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.059
\]

\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AVS})}
\]

\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.7 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.665} = \frac{0.045}{0.71} = \frac{45}{7100}
\]

\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx 0.0063
\]

Combining these and adjusting for interpretation:

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.059
\]

\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx 0.0063
\]

So, the answers are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.059,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.0063
}
```
