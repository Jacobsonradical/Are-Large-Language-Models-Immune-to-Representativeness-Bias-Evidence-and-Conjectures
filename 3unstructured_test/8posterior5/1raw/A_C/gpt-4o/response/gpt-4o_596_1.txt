To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are interested in comparing the probabilities for different fields and we are not given the exact \( P(E) \), we will use proportionality:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We are to compare the fields of agricultural and veterinary science and computer science. Let's break down our estimates step by step:

1. **Base Rate Probability \( P(H) \) for each field:**
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, the base rate probability might be relatively low as it's a more niche field.
   - For computer science, the base rate probability might be higher because it's a more common field of study.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) based on the given personality sketch:**
   - Agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with the personality traits mentioned (genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy).
   - Computer science aligns well with some traits (solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts), but not as well with others (love for animals, curiosity about nature).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field:**
   - This represents how likely the personality is to appear if Adam is not in that field. This value is a bit more challenging to estimate, but we can use general alignment as an indicator.

Given these estimates, we can proceed as follows:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Base Rate \( P(H) \):** Let's assume \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \) as it's less common.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** The personality traits strongly align, so we might set \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \).
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** Assuming the traits are less common outside this field, let's set \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.3 \).

### Computer Science
1. **Base Rate \( P(H) \):** Let's assume \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \) as it's more common.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** The personality traits align moderately well, so we might set \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.5 \).
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** Assuming the traits are common outside this field, let's set \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.4 \).

Using these estimates in Bayes' rule, we get:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  \[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

- **Computer Science:**
  \[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.3 = 0.15 \]

Now we normalize these to get the final probabilities:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.15} = \frac{0.08}{0.23} \approx 0.35 \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.08 + 0.15} = \frac{0.15}{0.23} \approx 0.65 \]

So, our resultant probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35,
  "computer science": 0.65
}
```
