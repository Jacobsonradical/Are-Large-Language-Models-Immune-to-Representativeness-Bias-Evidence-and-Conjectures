To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study given Adam's personality sketch, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's break it down for each field, using reasonable assumptions based on Adamâ€™s personality sketch and general knowledge.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's interest in nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work, it's reasonable to assume there's a higher initial probability that Adam could be in this field.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's characteristics fit well with this field, suggesting a high probability he would match the personality sketch if he were in this field.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H)= 0.9 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - There are many other graduate fields that might not align as well with Adam's personality sketch. Therefore, the probability of him having this personality sketch in other fields might be lower.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### For Computer Science:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - While Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, computer science might not align perfectly with his strong empathy, warmth, and love for nature.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence might fit reasonably well within the computer science field, but the empathy and love for nature might not align as strongly.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Again, the likelihood is more spread out over various other fields having similar fit as this one.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Now, let's compute the posterior probabilities. 

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

The total probability \( P(E) \) for this field is:

\[ P(E) = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.3)) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.27 + 0.14 = 0.41 \]

The posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.41} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.27}{0.41} \approx 0.659 \]

### For Computer Science:

The total probability \( P(E) \) for this field is:

\[ P(E) = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.2)) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.32 = 0.4 \]

The posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.4} = 0.2 \]

So the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.659,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
