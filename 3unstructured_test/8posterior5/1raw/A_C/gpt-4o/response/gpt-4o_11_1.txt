To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to understand the following terms:

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing the evidence given Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing the evidence given Adam is not in that field.

Bayes' Rule formula: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the evidence \( E \) and the hypotheses \( H \) for the two fields, let's estimate the probabilities:

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): The likelihood of a random graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this to be 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s strong empathy, curiosity about nature and plants, and love for animals, it's highly likely he fits the profile. Let's estimate this as 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that there are many other fields where his love for animals and nature might be relevant, let's estimate this as 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, let's denote \( k = P(E) \):

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{k} = \frac{0.04}{k} \]

### 2. Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): The likelihood of a random graduate student being in computer science. Let's assume this to be 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, but with lower relevance to animals and nature, let's estimate this as 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he is not in computer science. This includes all other fields, so let's estimate this as 0.4 (since there are several fields without his specific personality traits).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Using the same normalizing constant \( k = P(E) \):

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{k} = \frac{0.04}{k} \]

To summarize the values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.04/k",
  "computer science": "0.04/k"
}
```

Given that \( k \) is the same for all comparisons within the same context, we can focus on computing the relative probabilities, which are equally likely given the assumptions:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.04
}
```
