To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we will leverage Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence, which can be derived but is not needed for the relative comparison between fields.

For simplicity, let's assume the base prior probabilities for \( P(H) \) are roughly equal, which we'll adjust based on the nature of the fields. 

Letâ€™s analyze each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and curiosity about nature, a moderate to high probability would be reasonable.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** High, as Adam's traits align well with those required in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** Moderate, as these traits can be somewhat relevant to other fields but not as strongly.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** Given Adam's high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, a moderate probability is reasonable.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Moderate, as some aspects of his personality align with computer science fields.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** High, as problem-solving and intelligence are applicable to many other fields.

Let's assign estimated values:
- \( P(H_{1}) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.3
- \( P(H_{2}) \) for Computer Science: 0.2

- \( P(E|H_{1}) \): 0.8
- \( P(E|H_{2}) \): 0.5

- \( P(E|\neg H_{1}) \): 0.3
- \( P(E|\neg H_{2}) \): 0.6

We calculate \( P(H|E) \) but interpret relatively since \( P(E) \) is consistent across hypotheses.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{(0.8 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.3))}\approx 0.52\),
  "computer science": \(\frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{(0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot (1 - 0.2))}\approx 0.18\)
}

Thus the values are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.52,
  "computer science": 0.18
}
