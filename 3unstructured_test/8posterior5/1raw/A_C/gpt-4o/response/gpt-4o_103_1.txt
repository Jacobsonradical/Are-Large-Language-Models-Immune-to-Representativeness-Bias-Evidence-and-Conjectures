To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in specific fields of graduate study given his personality sketch (E), we can use Bayes' rule. Here’s the step-by-step approach to translate Adam’s traits into probabilities for each field:

1. **Define the hypotheses:**
   - \( H_{\text{agric}} \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( H_{\text{comp}} \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

2. **Assign prior probabilities \( P(H) \):**
   - \( P(H_{\text{agric}}) \): The probability that a randomly selected graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(H_{\text{comp}}) \): The probability that a randomly selected graduate student is in computer science.

   Let’s assume, based on arbitrary but reasonable assumptions:
   - \( P(H_{\text{agric}}) = 0.1 \): 10% of graduate students might be in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(H_{\text{comp}}) = 0.2 \): 20% of graduate students might be in computer science.

3. **Calculate \( P(E|H) \):**
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agric}}) \): The probability of Adam's traits given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science would be high, as his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field.

     Let’s assume \( P(E|H_{\text{agric}}) = 0.8 \).

   - \( P(E|H_{\text{comp}}) \): The probability of Adam’s traits given that he is in computer science might be lower since the E description fits less closely, though his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills can still be relevant.

     Let’s assume \( P(E|H_{\text{comp}}) = 0.4 \).

4. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agric}}) \): The probability of Adam's traits given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.

     Assuming the remaining fields not strongly aligned with the specifics of E,
     Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agric}}) = 0.3 \).

   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{comp}}) \): The probability of Adam's traits given that he is not in computer science.

     Again, assuming the remaining fields do not strongly align with the specifics of E,
     Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{comp}}) = 0.5 \).

5. **Apply Bayes’ Rule:**

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) can be approximated through the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)
\]

   - For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{agric}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.35} \approx 0.2286
\]

   - For computer science:

\[
P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times 0.8) = 0.08 + 0.4 = 0.48
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{comp}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.48} \approx 0.1667
\]

Given these calculations, the confidence in the hypotheses based on Adam's traits are approximately:
