To answer this question, we'll use Bayes' theorem:  
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]  

However, since we don't have all the exact values for \(P(E)\), we'll just reason about the relative values of \(\frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}\). Considering \(P(E)\) as a normalizing factor, we'll estimate the likelihood ratios.

Let’s evaluate for both fields.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior belief that Adam was enrolled in CS. Given the popularity of CS in the U.S., it can be estimated as moderate (e.g., 0.2).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality (E) given that he is in CS. Given his curiosity and intelligence fit well, but empathy and love for nature don’t strongly indicate CS. Let’s estimate it as moderate (e.g., 0.2).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing his personality given he is not in CS. This is also moderate since several other fields could fit. (e.g., 0.2).

So,

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior belief that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This might be lower than CS in popularity (e.g., 0.1).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he is in Agri/Vet. Science. Given his strong empathy, love for animals, interest in plants, and appreciation for hard work, it fits very well. Let’s estimate it as high (e.g., 0.8).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given his personality and he is not in this field, could be relatively lower because of how well it fits (e.g., 0.4).

So,

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Agri/Vet}} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Therefore, normalizing proportionally,

\[ \text{Normalization constant} = 0.04 + 0.08 = 0.12 \]

Finally the probabilities,

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.04}{0.12} \approx 0.33 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.08}{0.12} \approx 0.67 \)
}

{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67
}
