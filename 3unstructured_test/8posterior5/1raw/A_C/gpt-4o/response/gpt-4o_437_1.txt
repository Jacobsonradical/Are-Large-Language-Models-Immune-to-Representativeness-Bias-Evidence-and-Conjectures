Let's start by assigning probabilities for each component required in Bayes' Rule for the given fields.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** Prior probability of Adam being in Computer Science. Assuming Computer Science is a common graduate field, especially in the U.S., we might assign a moderate prior. Let's approximate:
   - P(H) = 0.2

2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is in Computer Science. Adam's profile suggests a strong interest in nature, empathy, and animals — which are less characteristic of computer science.
   - P(E|H) = 0.05

3. **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of observing Adam's profile if he is not in Computer Science. Given Adam's characteristics, it's more likely if he were in a field more aligned with his nature interests and empathy.
   - P(E|¬H) = 0.2

4. **P(E):** The overall probability of observing Adam's profile given any field. This is a weighted sum of the likelihoods across all possible fields. It can be approximated, but for this comparison, we just need a consistent denominator derived from the given fields:
   - P(E) = [(P(E|H) * P(H)) + (P(E|¬H) * P(¬H))]
   - Assuming the probability distribution among other fields, P(¬H) = 0.8:
   - P(E) = (0.05 * 0.2) + (0.2 * 0.8) = 0.01 + 0.16 = 0.17

Using Bayes' Rule:
   - P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = (0.05 * 0.2) / 0.17 ≈ 0.059

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H):** Prior probability of Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is a less common field than Computer Science but highly relevant to his interests and characteristics.
   - P(H) = 0.05

2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Adam perfectly fits the profile of someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - P(E|H) = 0.8

3. **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of observing Adam's profile if he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science could be lower than the non-specific likelihood because this field highly correlates to his traits:
   - P(E|¬H) = 0.15

4. **P(E):** The overall probability of Adam's profile, given this is the same configuration:
   - P(E) = [(P(E|H) * P(H)) + (P(E|¬H) * P(¬H))]
   - Assuming the probability distribution among other fields, P(¬H) = 0.95:
   - P(E) = (0.8 * 0.05) + (0.15 * 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.1425 = 0.1825

Using Bayes' Rule:
   - P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.05) / 0.1825 ≈ 0.219

### Conclusion:

Here are the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.059,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.219
}
