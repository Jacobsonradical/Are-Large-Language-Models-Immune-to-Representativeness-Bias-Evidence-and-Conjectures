To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch, \(P(H|E)\), we use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, because we are comparing the probabilities for two fields, the actual value of \(P(E)\) isn't crucial since it will be the same for both fields and hence cancels out when comparing them. We need to estimate \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was in this field. Given his interest in nature, plants, and animals, we assume a relatively high prior. Let's take \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
    - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was indeed in this field. Given his characteristics, this is very likely, so let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
    - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was not in this field. Given his traits could also fit other fields, let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

2. **Computer Science**
    - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was in this field. Many students are interested in computer science, but it doesn't fit perfectly with his described traits. Let’s take \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
    - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was indeed in this field. It's plausible but not a perfect match, so let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
    - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was not in this field, which might be relatively high because many different fields could account for his traits. Let’s assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{agricultural} | E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural})}{P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural}) + P(E|\neg H_{agricultural}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{agricultural}))} \]

\[
P(H_{agricultural} | E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} \approx \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.32} = \frac{0.18}{0.50} = 0.36
\]

\[ P(H_{cs} | E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{cs}))} \]

\[
P(H_{cs} | E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.45} = \frac{0.03}{0.48} = 0.0625
\]

Summarizing the results:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.36",
  "computer science": "0.0625"
