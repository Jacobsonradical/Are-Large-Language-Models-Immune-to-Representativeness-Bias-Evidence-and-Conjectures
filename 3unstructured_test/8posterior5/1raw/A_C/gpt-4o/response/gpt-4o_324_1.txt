Let's analyze the given information and estimate the probabilities:

Given:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a quiet demeanor, enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart, strong empathy, a deep love for animals, is highly intelligent, and understands abstract concepts.
- Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.

We need to judge the probabilities for each field:

1. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Probability that Adam was enrolled in CS.
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Probability of personality traits \( E \) given Adam was enrolled in CS.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Probability of personality traits \( E \) given Adam was not enrolled in CS.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Probability that Adam was enrolled in AVS.
   - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Probability of personality traits \( E \) given Adam was enrolled in AVS.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): Probability of personality traits \( E \) given Adam was not enrolled in AVS.

### Probabilities Estimation:

For **CS**:
- Generally, CS students are often highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which fits the description of Adam.
- Curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals might not be strongly associated with CS students.
  
Thus:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) could be moderate to high because CS is a common field.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) might be low to moderate because only part of his personality traits match typical CS traits.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \) could be moderate because non-CS students cover a wide range of other disciplines.

For **AVS**:
- Students in AVS are likely to have a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals.
- Empathy, a warm heart, and strong appreciation for hard work would fit well in AVS.
  
Thus:
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \) may be moderate because it's less common than CS but still relevant.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) would likely be high because Adam's traits strongly match those in AVS.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \) could be moderate because non-AVS students include other fields where some traits might match.

### Bayesian Calculations:

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Final Calculation (Values are assumed for a qualitative judgment):

#### Computer Science:
- \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.25 \) (Computer Science is a popular field)
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.3 \) (Some traits match but not all)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.6 \) (Many other fields match)

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.15 \) (Less common but relevant)
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \) (Most traits align well)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.5 \)

### Calculation Example (Normalized for Likelihoods):
Given arbitrary normalization:
\( P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + ...\)

For simplicity, let's normalize our focus on CS and AVS only:

\[ P(E) \approx (0.3 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.15) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.075 + 0.12 = 0.195 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.195} \approx 0.385 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.195} \approx 0.615 \]

### Result in Required Format:
Based on these qualitative estimates:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.385,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.615
}
