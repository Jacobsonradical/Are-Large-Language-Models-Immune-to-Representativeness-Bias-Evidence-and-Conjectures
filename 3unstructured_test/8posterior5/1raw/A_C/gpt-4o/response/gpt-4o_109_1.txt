To apply Bayes' rule, we need to break down the problem by estimating the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the complement likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \). Let's start with these estimations based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Assume that the base rate for any given student being in any specific field, like computer science (CS), is relatively moderate. Let's roughly estimate this at \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Given the sketch, Adam's attributes related to curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work do not align strongly with the typical traits we might associate with a CS student. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do. Thus, let's estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Most students not in CS would have the diverse array of fields with various attributes. Many may still be curious, empathetic, and hardworking, so let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.6 \).

Using Bayes’ rule:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

Given we're considering two hypotheses at the moment, we'll take:

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) 
\]

\[ 
P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 = 0.08 + 0.48 = 0.56 
\]

Thus,

\[ 
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.56} \approx 0.143 
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Assume that the base rate for a student being in agricultural and veterinary science (Ag/Vet) is relatively lower compared to more popular fields like CS. Let's estimate \( P(H_{Ag/Vet}) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's interest in nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work aligns very well with agricultural and veterinary science, so let's estimate \( P(E|H_{Ag/Vet}) = 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: For students not in Ag/Vet science, the likelihood of having Adam's set of traits would be somewhat less aligned, but still present to some extent, so let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{Ag/Vet}) = 0.5 \).

Using the same Bayes’ rule calculation:

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_{Ag/Vet}) \cdot P(H_{Ag/Vet}) + P(E|\neg H_{Ag/Vet}) \cdot P(\neg H_{Ag/Vet}) 
\]

\[ 
P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.45 = 0.53 
\]

Thus,

\[ 
P(H_{Ag/Vet}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.53} \approx 0.151 
\]
