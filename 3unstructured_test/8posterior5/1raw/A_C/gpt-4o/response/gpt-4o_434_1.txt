Sure, let's analyze the probabilities and use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

### Computer Science

1. \( P(H) \) (prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science):
   - Given that computer science is a popular graduate field, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \) (probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in computer science):
   - Adam has a love for solving puzzles and high intelligence, which are characteristics that could be associated with a computer science student. However, the focus on nature and animals is less relevant. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) (probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in computer science):
   - Since Adam's interests might be associated more with fields other than computer science, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
To find \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8 = 0.08 + 0.56 = 0.64 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.64} \approx 0.125 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. \( P(H) \) (prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science):
   - Given that this field is less common than computer science but still significant, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \) (probability of Adam’s personality sketch given he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science):
   - Adam's characteristics strongly align with this field, given his love for nature, animals, and appreciation for dedication in these fields. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) (probability of Adam’s personality sketch given he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science):
   - Given that these traits are less central to other fields, we maintain the previous \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
To find \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9 = 0.09 + 0.63 = 0.72 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.72} \approx 0.125 \]

### Final Results

Both computations yield approximately the same posterior probability, which given the realistic assumptions is coincidental but not improbable.
