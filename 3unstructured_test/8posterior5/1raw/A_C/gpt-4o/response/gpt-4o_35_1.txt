To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam's field of study, we need to apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

This requires us to evaluate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field.

Since \( P(H) \) and \( P(\neg H) \) are assumed to be independent of each other for all other fields, \( P(E) \) is a constant factor that can be ignored when comparing relative probabilities between fields.


### **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- **Prior** \( P(H) \):
  Estimating the relative popularity of different graduate fields, let's assume a prior:
  \( P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.1 \) (10% of graduate students).

- **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \):
  Adam has a strong appreciation for nature and animals, making this field quite likely:
  \( P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood).

- **Complement Likelihood** \( P(E|\neg H) \):
  Given the entire graduate student population outside this field, let's assume:
  \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.2 \) (lower relative likelihood).

### **Computer Science**

- **Prior** \( P(H) \):
  Given its popularity, let's assume a higher prior:
  \( P(H_{\text{computer}}) = 0.2 \) (20% of graduate students).

- **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \):
  While Adam enjoys solving puzzles, other traits might not fit as well within typical Computer Science interests:
  \( P(E|H_{\text{computer}}) = 0.3 \) (moderate likelihood).

- **Complement Likelihood** \( P(E|\neg H) \):
  Given the traits and other fields, an estimated likelihood is:
  \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer}}) = 0.3 \) (similar likelihood in non-computer science fields).


### Calculation via Bayes' Rule
For simplicity, we still need to calculate relative values ignoring \( P(E) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{computer}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{computer}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer}}) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06
   \]

Let's normalize these values:
\[
P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.06} = \frac{0.08}{0.14} \approx 0.57
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{computer}}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.08 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.43
\]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57,
  "computer science": 0.43
}
```
These values display the relative likelihoods given Adam's personality sketch.
