To apply Bayes' rule, we need to assess the probabilities as follows:

1. **P(H)** — The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specified field.
2. **P(E|H)** — The probability of the observed characteristics (personality sketch) given that Adam is enrolled in the specified field.
3. **P(E|¬H)** — The probability of the observed characteristics given that Adam is not enrolled in the specified field.

Given these probabilities, Bayes' rule can be used to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor and can be considered constant when comparing two fields. Thus, we can focus on the relative values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a student is enrolled in computer science. Considering many graduate students are enrolled in computer science-related fields, let's take this to be moderate, say \(\approx 0.3\).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that a computer science student has the personality traits described. While many computer science students might enjoy solving puzzles and have high intelligence, the strong empathy and love for animals might be less common. Assume this is relatively low, say \(\approx 0.2\).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone with Adam's personality sketch is *not* in computer science. Given the characteristics align more with other fields, assume this to be higher, say \(\approx 0.8\).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given fewer students compared to fields like computer science, let's take this to be lower, say \(\approx 0.1\).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability that an agricultural and veterinary science student has Adam's personality traits. Given the traits align well with the field (curiosity about nature, animals, empathy), assume this to be high, say \(\approx 0.8\).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: This would be lower, considering the alignment of traits with this field. Say \(\approx 0.3\).

Using Bayes' rule without normalizing,

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Thus, relative probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
```

These estimates suggest that, based on Adam's personality traits, he is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, although both probabilities are relatively low and should be considered in context with other possible fields.
