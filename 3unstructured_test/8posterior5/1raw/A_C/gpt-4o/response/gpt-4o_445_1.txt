Let's denote the fields as follows:
- \( H_{CS} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{AVS} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, computing \( P(E) \) directly can be complicated without additional information, so we will give the relative likelihood of the hypotheses instead.

Let's assign prior probabilities and evaluate the likelihoods.

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H_{CS}) \))**:
   - There are many graduate students in computer science, so let's suppose a general prior probability \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H_{CS}) \))**:
   - While computer science students can be intelligent and enjoy solving puzzles, the personality sketch doesn’t especially align with a strong appreciation of nature, animals, or empathy, which are typically not the central themes in computer science curricula. Therefore, let’s set a lower likelihood, perhaps \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.1 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \))**:
   - Assuming relatively equally likely other fields, let's conservatively estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H_{AVS}) \))**:
   - This field is less common than computer science but aligns much more closely with Adam’s described characteristics. Let's suppose a general prior probability \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H_{AVS}) \))**:
   - The personality sketch almost perfectly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science, given the love for nature, animals, and empathy. Therefore, we’ll set a high likelihood, maybe \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \))**:
   - For the complement likelihood when Adam is not in this field, it would blend into the prior odds given all remaining fields. But since this is a less likely field if not matched to the characteristics, let’s assign \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.2 \).

### Applying Bayes' Rule
For **computer science**:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) cancels in relative measure:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) = 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS})P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) cancels in relative measure:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS})P(H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Final Relative Probabilities
Normalizing the above relative measures to compare:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = 0.03 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = 0.08 \]

Thus, the likelihoods from Bayes’ rule normalized for context would look like:

{
  "computer science": 0.27,  \[ \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.08} = 0.27 \]
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.73 \[ \frac{0.08}{0.03 + 0.08} = 0.73 \]
}

So, the final response is:
{
  "computer science": 0.27,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.73
}
