To solve this using Bayes' rule, let's break down the essential probabilities for each field of study. We'll firstly estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis does not hold \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Estimations:

#### Computer Science:
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Let's consider this as the general popularity of the field among graduate students in the U.S. Computer Science is a common field, so we can estimate it moderately.
  - Estimate: \( P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \)

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s characteristics such as high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts fit well with a Computer Science student, but his clearly expressed love for nature, plants, and animals and empathy might not be strong indicators of this field.
  - Estimate: \( P(E|\text{H}_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1 \)

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: To establish this, we need to consider how common Adam’s profile is among all other fields.
  - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg \text{H}_{\text{CS}}) = 0.02 \) (since his unique profile might be less likely outside of fields like agricultural and veterinary science)

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: This field might be less popular than Computer Science, so we’ll estimate it lower.
  - Estimate: \( P(\text{H}_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.05 \)

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s characteristics are highly fitting for this field due to his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his strong empathy and love for animals.
  - Estimate: \( P(E|\text{H}_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.8 \)

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This would be the likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch among all other fields except agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg \text{H}_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.02 \) (similar reasoning as above, considering Adam’s profile)

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

**For Computer Science:**
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{H}_{\text{CS}})P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.02 \times 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.016 = 0.036 \]

\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.036} \approx 0.556 \]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{H}_{\text{AgVet}})P(\text{H}_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.02 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.019 = 0.059 \)

\[ P(\text{H}_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.059} \approx 0.678 \]

Therefore, the computed probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.556,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.678
}
```
