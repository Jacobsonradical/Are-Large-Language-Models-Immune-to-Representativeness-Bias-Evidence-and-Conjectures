To determine the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study using Bayes' Theorem, we first need estimates for the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the complement of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated using:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's make reasonable estimations based on the common characteristics and likelihoods observed among graduate fields.

### Computer Science

**Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):**
Let's assume that the prior probability \( P(H) \) that Adam is enrolled in computer science is \( 0.2 \), as it's a very common graduate field in the U.S.

**Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, his personality sketch is less indicative of a computer science student. He does have high intelligence and an aptitude for puzzles and abstract concepts, which are beneficial in computer science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as \( 0.3 \).

**Likelihood of Evidence Given Complement, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
Considering Adam's attributes are more aligned with fields like biology or environmental science, the probability of his personality sketch \( E \) matching students not in computer science could be higher. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as \( 0.7 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):**
Let's assume that the prior probability \( P(H) \) that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is \( 0.1 \), as this field is less common but still significant.

**Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
Adam's personality sketch closely aligns with attributes beneficial for agricultural and veterinary science: curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) should be high. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as \( 0.8 \).

**Likelihood of Evidence Given Complement, \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
Given that students who do not study in agricultural and veterinary science might not exhibit such a strong alignment with Adam's characteristics, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as \( 0.4 \).

Using these estimates, we can compute \( P(H|E) \) for both fields:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.56 = 0.62 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.62} = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \approx 0.097 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.36 = 0.44 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.44} = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \approx 0.182 \]

So the estimated posterior probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.097,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182
}
