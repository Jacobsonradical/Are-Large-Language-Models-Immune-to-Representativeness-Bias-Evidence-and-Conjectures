To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we first need to estimate some probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality traits given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality traits given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields when comparing their relative probabilities, we can use a simplified form:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Computer Science

- **P(H)** (Prior for computer science): Assuming computer science is a common field but not exceedingly so, let's estimate it as 0.1 (10%).
- **P(E|H)** (Likelihood of Adam's traits given computer science): Given Adam's empathy, love for nature and animals, this might be less common among typical computer science students, but possible. Let's estimate it as 0.2.
- **P(E|¬H)** (Likelihood of Adam's traits given not computer science): Considering a broader population of graduate students, these traits could be more common in other fields. Let’s estimate it as 0.3.

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \propto P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1= 0.02 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)** (Prior for agricultural and veterinary science): Assuming this is less common than computer science, but still significant, let's estimate it as 0.05 (5%).
- **P(E|H)** (Likelihood of Adam's traits given agricultural and veterinary science): Given Adam’s traits, this seems highly likely. Let's estimate it as 0.7.
- **P(E|¬H)** (Likelihood of Adam's traits given not agricultural and veterinary science): Considering a broader population, these traits could be less common. Let’s estimate it as 0.2.

\[ P(\text{AgVet}|E) \propto P(E|\text{AgVet}) \cdot P(\text{AgVet}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

### Normalize for comparison

Since we are only comparing these two fields and our answers are proportional, we normalize corresponding probabilities to sum to 1 for ease of understanding:

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.035} \approx 0.36 \]
\[ P(\text{AgVet}|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.02 + 0.035} \approx 0.64 \]

Our final answer, rounding slightly for simplicity, would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.36,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64
}
