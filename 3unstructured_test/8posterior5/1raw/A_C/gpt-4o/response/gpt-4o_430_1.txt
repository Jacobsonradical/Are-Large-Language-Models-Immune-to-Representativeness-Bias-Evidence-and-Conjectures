Let's denote:
- \(P(H_{\text{CS}})\) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\) as the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})\) as the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science.

Similarly,
- \(P(H_{\text{AgriVet}})\) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}})\) as the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgriVet}})\) as the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch).

Let's estimate the values:

### Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\)
- Computer Science (CS): Let's assume a moderate prior probability, considering that CS is a popular graduate field. \(P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3\)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AgriVet): Since it is less common but still relevant based on Adam's profile, let's assume a slightly lower probability. \(P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}) = 0.2\)

### Likelihoods \(P(E|H)\)
- \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\): Adam’s traits such as curiosity, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with CS, but his deep love for animals and nature is less typical for this field. Estimate \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3\).
- \(P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}})\): Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align well with AgriVet. Estimate \(P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}}) = 0.8\).

### Likelihoods \(P(E|\neg H)\)
For not being in a particular field, we assume other fields where the personality sketch might fit less well:

- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})\): Estimate that Adam's personality sketch is somewhat likely outside of CS. Let's set \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7\).
- \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgriVet}})\): Less likely for other fields considering his specific traits. Let's set \(P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgriVet}}) = 0.4\).

### Calculate Posterior Probabilities \(P(H|E)\)

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgriVet}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is common in the denominator, it cancels out for relative comparison:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.7 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.49 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.58 \]

Recomputing for relative comparison:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.58} = \frac{0.09}{0.58} \approx 0.155 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.58} = \frac{0.16}{0.58} \approx 0.276 \]

So, in conclusion:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.155,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.276
}
```
