Sure, let's break this down step-by-step using Bayesian inference. 

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without any additional information. Let's assume the probability of enrolling in this field among all graduate students is 5%, so P(H) = 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the personality traits described (E) given that he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given his traits (warm heart, empathy, love for nature, animals, and deep understanding of hard work), this likelihood is high, say 0.7.
- **P(E**|**¬H)**: The probability of Adam having the personality traits (E) given that he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science. While these traits can exist in other fields, they might not be as common; let's assume this to be 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.095 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.13 \]

Now calculating \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.269 \]

### 2. Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given its popularity, let's assume a higher enrollment probability, say 10%, so P(H) = 0.10.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the personality traits (E) given that he is studying computer science. Some of his traits might fit, such as high intelligence and puzzle-solving, but others like love for nature and animals might be less typical; let’s assume this likelihood is moderate, at 0.3.
- **P(E**|**¬H)**: The probability of Adam having the personality traits (E) given that he is not studying computer science. Assuming the traits as before, let’s keep this as 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule again:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.10) + (0.1 \times 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.09 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 \]

Now calculating \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.10}{0.12} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.12} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.25 \]

So, the final probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.269,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```
