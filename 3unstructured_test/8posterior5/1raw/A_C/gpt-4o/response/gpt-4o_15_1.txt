Let's evaluate the problem using Bayes Rule. First, we define:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in field \( H \).
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in field \( H \) given the personality sketch \( E \).

According to Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

for our purposes, we can ignore \( P(E) \) since it is constant for different fields. Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Let's assign the values:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given the popularity of computer science as a graduate field, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given computer science. Adam's love for solving puzzles and intelligence may indeed fit a computer science student, but his interest in nature and animals is less typical of this field. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given he was not in computer science. Given that personality traits such as empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature are more common in other fields, the value could be higher compared to fields excluding computer science. Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

   Then, the unnormalized probability \( P(H|E) \):
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the more specialized nature of this field, let’s assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given agricultural and veterinary science. Traits such as a love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy are quite consistent with this field. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given he was not in agricultural and veterinary science. Other fields might not exhibit such tightly coupled traits. Let’s assign \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

   Then, the unnormalized probability \( P(H|E) \):
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

To normalize and provide the final probabilities, we compare the values:

\[ 
"computer science": \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.04} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 
\]
\[ 
"agricultural and veterinary science": \frac{0.04}{0.03 + 0.04} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 
\]

Thus, the results would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4286,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5714
}
```
