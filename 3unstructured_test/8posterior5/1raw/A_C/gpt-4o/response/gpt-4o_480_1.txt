To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we will use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H. 
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of E given H.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of E.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of E given not H.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, let's assign some reasonable values and make estimations based on contextual understanding.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in computer science. Let’s assume this is moderately likely among graduate students in the U.S., so perhaps around 0.2 or 20%.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of having Adam's detailed personality (E) if he were in computer science. Although computer science students can have diverse personalities, Adam's deep love for nature and animals might be less common here, so let’s say 0.1 or 10%.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of having Adam's personality if he were not in computer science. Given that many other fields might match Adam's personality better, let’s assume a higher likelihood, around 0.3 or 30%.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume this is less common compared to computer science, so perhaps around 0.05 or 5%.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of having Adam's personality if he were in agricultural and veterinary science. This matches very well since his deep love for animals and nature fit this field, so let’s say 0.6 or 60%.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of having Adam's personality if he were not in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume a much lower value, around 0.25 or 25%.

To compare the exact values, we need the overall \( P(E) \), but we can reason that the ratio of the values for the two different fields can give us a good estimate. Bayes' rule ultimately evaluates these in conjunction, typically simplifying to comparative likelihoods.

Now, let's use these approximations to estimate \( P(H|E) \):

For **computer science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

To find the relative ratio:

For **computer science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.05 = 0.03 \]

Normalizing these probabilities to sum to 1 for simplicity in this context:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.03} \approx 0.4 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}} = \frac{0.03}{0.02 + 0.03} \approx 0.6 \]

Therefore, our estimates are as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
