To compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' Rule, which is given by:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field, \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field, \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field, and \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, which we don't need to compute directly since it is constant across different fields.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science can be considered moderate due to the popularity of the field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits (interest in nature and animals, warm-hearted, solving puzzles) given he is in computer science might be lower because these traits are not strongly associated with computer science students. 
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing these traits if he is not a computer science student would be higher, given that there are many other fields that align better with his traits.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower due to the field being less common than computer science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits given he is in agricultural and veterinary science would be high. The traits described fit well with this field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing these traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science would be lower because few fields align closely with all described traits.

Combining this information, we can provide subjective estimates for each.

### Estimates:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) = 0.4 \)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \)
   - Based on \( P(E) \), we derive a relatively lower posterior.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (lower prior due to less common field among graduates)
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
   - Given the match in traits, we derive a higher posterior.

Using Bayes' rule and estimating subjective values:

- For Computer Science, due to low \( P(E|H) \):
  \[
  P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.08}{P(E)}
  \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science, due to high \( P(E|H) \):
  \[
  P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.08}{P(E)}
  \]

Given that both outcomes provide equal numerators (by our subjective choices), the key difference is likely in the uncommonness of other fields fitting the traits. Thus, the Agricultural and Veterinary Science should still rank higher given appropriateness to Adam's traits.

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

Note: The values are estimates based on subjective interpretation and are intended for illustrative purposes. Adjustments can be made with more precise data or different subjective assessments.
