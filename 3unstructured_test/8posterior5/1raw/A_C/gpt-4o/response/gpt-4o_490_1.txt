To compute the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in computer science or agricultural and veterinary science based on the provided personality sketch \( E \), we'll use Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) is true given that he is enrolled in the specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) is true given that he is not enrolled in the specific field.

Given that we do not have exact numerical values, we will make reasonable estimations based on common knowledge and inference from the personality sketch provided.

### Computer Science
1. **\( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) (Prior Probability)**: This is the general probability that any graduate student is studying computer science. It's a popular field, so let's assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \).

2. **\( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) (Likelihood)**: Adam’s traits of high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit this field well. However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals are less characteristic of the typical computer science student. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \) (Likelihood of the Evidence if Not in CS)**: This is the probability that Adam has these traits if he is not a computer science student. Given that his traits could fit many other fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **\( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \) (Prior Probability)**: This field is less common than computer science overall. Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.05 \).

2. **\( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \) (Likelihood)**: Adam’s curiosity about nature, warm heart, empathy, and love for animals fit very well with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.8 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \) (Likelihood of the Evidence if Not in AgVet)**: Like the previous calculation, this is the probability of Adam’s traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.1 \).

### Computation Using Bayes' Rule

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) can be approximated by combining \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) and \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \).

Given that \( \neg H_{\text{CS}} \) includes all other fields, let's normalize:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{CS}})) \]
\[ = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14 \]

Then:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.14} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.4286 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E)} \]

Using the same \( P(E) \) as before:

\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.14} = \frac{0.04}{0.14} \approx 0.2857 \]

### Final Probabilities

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4286,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2857
}
```

These probabilities give us an approximation of Adam's likely field of study based on his personality traits.
