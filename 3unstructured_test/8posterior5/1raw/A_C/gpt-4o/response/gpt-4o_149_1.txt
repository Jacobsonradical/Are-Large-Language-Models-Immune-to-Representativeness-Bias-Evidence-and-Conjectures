To calculate the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need the following terms:

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of evidence \( E \) given the negation of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H|E) \): Posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's break it down for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the number of graduate fields, let's assume this prior probability to be moderate, for example, 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's interest in nature, animals, and plants, this seems quite high, let’s say 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science. This could still be reasonable because abstract concepts and empathy could fit other fields, let’s assume 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule, we calculate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) = 0.16 + 0.32 = 0.48 \]

Thus:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.48} = \frac{0.16}{0.48} \approx 0.33 \]

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in computer science. Given the popularity of this field, let’s assume it as relatively high, for example, 0.3.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is studying computer science. While intelligence and puzzle-solving can be related to computer science, his love for animals and nature might be less related, let’s assume 0.5.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not studying computer science. This would be similar to before, let’s say 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.3) + (0.4 \cdot 0.7) = 0.15 + 0.28 = 0.43 \]

Thus:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.43} = \frac{0.15}{0.43} \approx 0.35 \]

### Summary

The posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.33,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

Note that these are estimates based on assumed prior probabilities; actual values might differ with more precise data.
