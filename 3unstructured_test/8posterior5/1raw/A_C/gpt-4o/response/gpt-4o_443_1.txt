Sure, I can help calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' Rule. Let's denote the hypotheses as follows:

- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Now, let's assign some reasonable values to the prior probabilities and the likelihoods based on the information given:

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - For \( H_1 \) (agricultural and veterinary science), let's denote the prior \( P(H_1) = 0.1 \).
   - For \( H_2 \) (computer science), let's denote the prior \( P(H_2) = 0.3 \).

   These values are arbitrary and should ideally be based on enrollment data for each field, but we'll use these as placeholders for this calculation.

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): Given Adam’s interest in nature, plants, and animals, and his empathy, the probability that these traits align with agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high. Let’s assume \( P(E|H_1) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): The likelihood that Adam’s traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, puzzles) align with computer science, which often requires abstract thinking and problem-solving, is lower but not zero. Let’s assume \( P(E|H_2) = 0.2 \).

3. **Complement Likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - When considering fields other than agricultural and veterinary science:
     \[
     P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.3 \quad \text{(Adam's traits may somewhat align with other fields, but less so)}
     \]
   - When considering fields other than computer science:
     \[
     P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.6 \quad \text{(A higher probability, as many fields value empathy and nature)}
     \]

Now, we use Bayes' Rule to find the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)}
\]

The probability \( P(E) \) can be computed as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1)
\]

For simplicity, considering only \( H_1 \) and \( H_2 \):

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
\]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.3) = 0.08 + 0.06 = 0.14
\]

Now, calculate \( P(H_1|E) \) and \( P(H_2|E) \):

\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.14} \approx 0.571
\]

\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.14} \approx 0.429
\]

Thus, the posterior probabilities can be summarized as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.571,
  "computer science": 0.429
}
```

This indicates that given the personality sketch E of Adam, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science, according to our initial assumptions and calculations.
