To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to consider the prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)), the likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)), and the evidence (\( P(E) \)).

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, for the purpose of this problem, we can compute the unnormalized probabilities since we are not required to ensure that they sum to 1. We only need to calculate the numerator of Bayes' rule, which is \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \). 

We'll assume the following reasonable estimates for priors and likelihoods based on Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Prior probability (\( P(H) \)) of being enrolled in Computer Science: Let's assume a prior of \( 0.15 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Since Adam has a high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, we can give a relatively high probability, say \( 0.6 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):  Given that the description also fits other fields, let's assume this is \( 0.4 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Prior probability (\( P(H) \)) of being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Let's assume this is \( 0.05 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals makes this field very fitting, so let's assume \( 0.9 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):  Given that he could also fit into other fields due to his other traits, we assume this is \( 0.3 \).

Using these values, we can compute:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.6 \cdot 0.15 = 0.09 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]

Normalizing within the context of these two fields (not required, but illustrative):
Total = \( 0.09 + 0.045 = 0.135 \).

Posterior for Computer Science given E:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.135} = 0.6667 \]

Posterior for Agricultural and Veterinary Science given E:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.135} = 0.3333 \]

So, simplifying without normalization:

{
  "computer science": 0.09,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045
}

These values indicate that, based on the given personality sketch, it's more likely (among the two fields) that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science, though Agricultural and Veterinary Science is also a plausible option.
