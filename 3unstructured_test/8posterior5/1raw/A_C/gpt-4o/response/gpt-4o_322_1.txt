To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need the following pieces of information:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that we would observe the personality sketch \(E\) if Adam were enrolled in the particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that we would observe the personality sketch \(E\) if Adam were not enrolled in the particular field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields in comparison, so we can compute relative probabilities and normalize them to see which field is more likely.

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability that Adam was a computer science graduate student is around 0.2, considering the popularity of the field.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Since Adam's traits like high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with studying computer science, let's estimate this as 0.5.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This reflects the likelihood of observing such traits if Adam wasn't a computer science student. Given that many fields value intelligence and abstract thinking, let's estimate this as 0.3.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability that Adam was an agricultural and veterinary science student is around 0.1, considering the field is less popular.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals aligns strongly with this field. Hence, let's estimate this probability to be high, around 0.8.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given the specific interests in nature and animals, let's estimate this as 0.2, since these traits are relatively more specialized.

### Calculations

Letâ€™s first compute the unnormalized probabilities for each field:

- **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E)_{CS} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1
  \]
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E)_{Agri} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
  \]

Next, we normalize these probabilities:

- Total: \( 0.1 + 0.08 = 0.18 \)
- Normalized \( P(H|E) \) for Computer Science: 
  \[
  \frac{0.1}{0.18} \approx 0.56
  \]
- Normalized \( P(H|E) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 
  \[
  \frac{0.08}{0.18} \approx 0.44
  \]

Thus, the output is:

{
  "computer science": 0.56,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.44
}
