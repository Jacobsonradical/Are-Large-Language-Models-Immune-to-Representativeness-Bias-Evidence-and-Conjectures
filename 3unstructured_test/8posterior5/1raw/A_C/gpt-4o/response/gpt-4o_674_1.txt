To apply Bayes' rule and compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to determine the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Let's assign some reasonable values based on the personality traits and background provided for Adam:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior probability)**: 
   - Assuming that the total graduate student population is evenly distributed among various fields, and agricultural and veterinary science is a moderately common field.
   - Estimate: \( P(H) = 0.05 \)

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood)**:
   - The likelihood that his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work align with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - High alignment: Estimate: \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
   
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood if not in this field)**:
   - Probability that Adam’s traits are seen in students not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Medium likelihood due to common traits of empathy and love for nature, but not as strongly associated: Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior probability)**: 
   - Assume an even distribution again, with computer science being a very common graduate field.
   - Estimate: \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
   
2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood)**:
   - The likelihood that his problem-solving skills and high intelligence make him a fit, but less alignment with his love for nature and animals.
   - Medium alignment: Estimate: \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \)
   
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood if not in this field)**:
   - Probability that Adam’s traits are seen in students not in computer science.
   - Relatively high likelihood due to diverse fields with similar problem-solving requirements: Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \)

Now applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.3 \times 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.285} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \approx 0.123 \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.5 \times 0.2 + 0.7 \times 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.66} \approx 0.152 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123,
  "computer science": 0.152
}
```
