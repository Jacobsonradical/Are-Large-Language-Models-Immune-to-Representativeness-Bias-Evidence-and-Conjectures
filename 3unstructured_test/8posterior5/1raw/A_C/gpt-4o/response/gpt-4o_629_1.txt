To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field (given the personality sketch E), we need to use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given the lack of specific statistical data, I will make some reasoned assumptions:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in a specific field of study.
   - I'll assume that the probability of a graduate student being in computer science is relatively high due to the popularity of the field. Let's say \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, I'll assume a lower prior probability because it is a less common graduate field. Let's say \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.05 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence (the personality traits) given Adam is in a specific field.
   - For computer science, while having high intelligence and solving puzzles align well, an interest in nature, plants, and animals is less common. So I'll estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.1 \).
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, Adam's interest aligns well with the field. I'll estimate \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given Adam is not in the specific field.
   - This is tricky without specific data, but let's assume the average probability of such a personality sketch in fields outside computer science and agricultural and veterinary science is moderately low. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2 \) and \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.1 \).

4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the evidence. This can be calculated as the weighted sum of all possible scenarios, but for simplicity, I'll assume \( P(E) \) is a constant.

Now we can proceed with these estimates:

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.02 / P(E) \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = 0.04 / P(E) \)
}

Since the denominators are the same \( P(E) \), I will normalize these posterior probabilities:

\[
{
  "computer science": \frac{0.02 / P(E)}{0.02 / P(E) + 0.04 / P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.04} = \frac{0.02}{0.06} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \frac{0.04 / P(E)}{0.02 / P(E) + 0.04 / P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{0.02 + 0.04} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67
}
\]

So, the final result is:

{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67
}
