To calculate the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

Let's evaluate these probabilities for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior probability \(P(H)\)**: The likelihood of a random graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science (denote it as relatively low compared to more populated fields like computer science, say 0.05).
- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his warm heart and empathy, the likelihood is relatively high. Suppose we estimate this as 0.8.
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The probability of observing these traits in students not in this field. Given that these traits are uncommon (particularly the specific combination), it might be relatively low, say 0.1.

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Assuming \(P(\neg H) = 0.95\):

\[
P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135
\]

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.135} = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.296
\]

### Computer Science
- **Prior probability \(P(H)\)**: Likelihood of being in computer science (a popular field, say 0.2).
- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Given Adam's interest in puzzles and intelligence, we can assume this could be moderate, say 0.4.
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: As before, assume 0.1.

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Assuming \(P(\neg H) = 0.8\):

\[
P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \cdot 0.8 = 0.08 + 0.08 = 0.16
\]

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.16} = \frac{0.08}{0.16} = 0.5
\]

### Results

Thus, the probabilities are:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
\]
