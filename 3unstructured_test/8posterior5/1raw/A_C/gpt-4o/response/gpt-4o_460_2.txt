To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or computer science, we need to evaluate the following probabilities: \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Following this, we'll use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

Let's break down the fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) \): The prior probability that any random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming a balanced distribution across various fields, let's use a middle-range value: 

   \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.1 \)

2. \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \): The likelihood that Adam exhibits the given personality sketch if he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly aligns with this field:

   \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.8 \)

3. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) \): The likelihood that Adam exhibits the given personality sketch if he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that his personality sketch is somewhat unique to this field, it would be relatively lower:

   \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}})}{P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{ag}})} \]
\[
= \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{(0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9)}
= \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27}
= \frac{0.08}{0.35}
\approx 0.228
\]

### Computer Science

1. \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): The prior probability that any random graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Given the popularity of the field, we may assign a slightly higher prior probability:

   \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.2 \)

2. \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): The likelihood that Adam exhibits the given personality sketch if he is enrolled in computer science. While Adamâ€™s intelligence and proficiency with abstract concepts align with computer science, his deep love for nature and animals does not:

   \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.3 \)

3. \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \): The likelihood that Adam exhibits the given personality sketch if he is not enrolled in computer science. Since his personality sketch doesn't typically align with computer science broadly, this value may be slightly higher:

   \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.5 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{cs}})} \]
\[
= \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{(0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8)}
= \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.4}
= \frac{0.06}{0.46}
\approx 0.130
\]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.228,
  "computer science": 0.130
}
```
