Given the personality sketch of Adam and using Bayes' theorem, we need to calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science. First, we'll assess the necessary probabilities:

1. **P(H) - Prior probability of being in each field**: This would need actual statistical data about all graduate students, but let's make some reasonable assumptions:
   - Computer science is a common graduate field, so we'll assume P(H) = 0.2 (20%).
   - Agricultural and veterinary science is less common than computer science, so we'll assume P(H) = 0.05 (5%).

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood of observing E given H**:
   - For computer science: Adam's love for puzzles and high intelligence fit well, but his appreciation for nature, plants, and animals does not. Hence, this likelihood is moderate. We'll set it to P(E|H) = 0.3.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and understanding of hard work strongly fit this field. Hence this likelihood is high. We'll set it to P(E|H) = 0.8.

3. **P(E|¬H) - Likelihood of observing E given not H**:
   - For computer science: Without actual fields, any other fields could equally fit or fail to fit the description. Assume P(E|¬H) = 0.2.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science: Other fields may still involve empathy or love for nature, but not as strongly. Assume P(E|¬H) = 0.1.

Let's start with the analysis for computer science:
Using Bayes' Theorem: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.2 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.16 = 0.22 \]

Now,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.22} = \frac{0.06}{0.22} \approx 0.2727 \]


Now, let's analyze for agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135 \]

Now,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.135} = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.2963 \]

So, based on these assumptions and calculations, the results are:
{
  "computer science": 0.2727,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2963
}

Please note that these values are based on our rough assumptions of priors and likelihoods, and real data would provide more precise results.
