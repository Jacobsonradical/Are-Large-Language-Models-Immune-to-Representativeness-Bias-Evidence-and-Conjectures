Let's evaluate each field separately using Bayes' rule.

Bayesâ€™ theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we can use a simplified version provided we focus on proportional values:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume there's a reasonable about 10% chance that a random graduate student might be in computer science.
   \[ P(H_{CS}) = 0.1 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's personality sketch, there might be a moderate fit because computer science often requires high intelligence and an aptitude for solving puzzles.
   \[ P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For non-computer science fields, the fit might be lower overall.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(H_{CS}) \cdot P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.4 = 0.04 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume a smaller chance (say, 5%) that a random graduate student is in this field.
   \[ P(H_{AVS}) = 0.05 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, the fit seems quite high.
   \[ P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - For non-agricultural and veterinary science fields, the fit is lower.
   \[ P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.2 \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(H_{AVS}) \cdot P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.05 \cdot 0.8 = 0.04 \]

Since these two measures are equally proportionate, in real analysis we'd need additional information or normalization. However, from the given information, we conclude the proportional posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
}
