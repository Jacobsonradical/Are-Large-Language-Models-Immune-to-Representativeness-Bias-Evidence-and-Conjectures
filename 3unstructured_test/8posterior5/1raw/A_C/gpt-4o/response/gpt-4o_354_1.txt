To apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), we need some initial values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). These probabilities are inherently subjective without specific data, so I will make reasoned assumptions based on the information provided.

Let's start by defining our terms to use in Bayes' rule:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given he is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given he is not enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field given the evidence of his personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume that among all graduate fields, the probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.05 (as an arbitrary small number based on overall distribution of fields).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals suggests a higher likelihood if he were in this field. I'll estimate this as 0.8.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of coming across someone with this personality might be lower. I'll estimate this as 0.1.

By Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Where \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \).

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.095 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.135 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.296 \]

### Computer Science
1. **\( P(H) \)**: Letâ€™s assume the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is higher due to general trends in graduate studies. I'll estimate it as 0.2.

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: While Adam is good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, his deep love for animals and nature is less typical for a computer science student. I'll estimate this as 0.4.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of meeting someone with Adam's characteristics in a field other than computer science could be similarly estimated to a broader distribution. I'll estimate this as 0.1.

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.08 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.16 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.16} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.16} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.5 \]

### Final Results
\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
\]

These probabilities reflect the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in these fields given his personality sketch.
