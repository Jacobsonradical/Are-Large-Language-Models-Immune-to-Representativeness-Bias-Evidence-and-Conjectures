Sure, let's go through the steps to compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule for both fields, computer science and agricultural and veterinary science.

Given:
- E: Personality sketch of Adam.
- H: Hypothesis that Adam is enrolled in the specified field.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H): Prior Probability**
   - Let’s assume a relatively moderate prior for Adam being in computer science, considering its popularity and high enrollment in graduate studies.
   - P(H) ≈ 0.3

2. **P(E|H): Likelihood of Evidence Given Hypothesis**
   - Adam's love for nature and animals doesn't particularly align with computer science. However, his high intelligence and capability to understand abstract concepts may make it plausible. The empathy and warm heart are not field-specific traits.
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.2

3. **P(E|¬H): Likelihood of Evidence Given Not Hypothesis**
   - The probability of a student in a different field (such as agricultural and veterinary science) having these traits is relatively higher, especially because of the strong link to nature and animals.
   - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.5

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.3) + (0.5 \times 0.7) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.35 = 0.41 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{0.41} = \frac{0.06}{0.41} \approx 0.15 \]

So for computer science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.15 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H): Prior Probability**
   - Agricultural and veterinary science is less common than computer science, but it still should be decently probable given Adam's interests.
   - P(H) ≈ 0.2

2. **P(E|H): Likelihood of Evidence Given Hypothesis**
   - Adam's characteristics strongly align with traits of students in agricultural and veterinary science, given his love for nature and animals.
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.8

3. **P(E|¬H): Likelihood of Evidence Given Not Hypothesis**
   - For students not in this field, it would probably be lower, as the specific traits aligning to this field are unique.
   - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.25

Using Bayes' rule:

Since \( P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.2) + (0.25 \times 0.8) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.16) + (0.2) = 0.36 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{0.36} = \frac{0.16}{0.36} \approx 0.44 \]

So for agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.44 \]

### Summary

Given these calculations, here's the final probability of Adam being in each field of study, given his personality sketch:

  "computer science": 0.15,
