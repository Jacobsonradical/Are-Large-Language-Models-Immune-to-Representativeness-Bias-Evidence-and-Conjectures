To compute the probabilities, we will use Bayes’ Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H (Adam's enrollment in a particular field).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of E given H (i.e., how likely Adam's personality sketch fits with his enrollment in that field).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of E given \( \neg H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of E, which can be calculated as:
 
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given the data, we should make reasonable estimates for these probabilities based on typical characteristics of students in these fields.

### Computer Science
**P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being in computer science. Computer science is a common graduate field, so we may assume a moderate prior.
- \( P(H)_{\text{cs}} = 0.2 \)

**P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits if he is in computer science.
- Adam’s love for nature and strong empathy do not strongly align with typical computer science curricula, although his high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles do. Let’s assume: 
- \( P(E|H)_{\text{cs}} = 0.2 \)

**P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of having those personality traits if not in computer science. Since there are many other fields where his traits might be more common, we can reasonably say:
- \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{cs}} = 0.4 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science. This is less common than computer science, so we might assign it a lower prior.
- \( P(H)_{\text{avs}} = 0.1 \)

**P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits if he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for plants, animals, and nature, this matches well.
- \( P(E|H)_{\text{avs}} = 0.8 \)

**P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of those personality traits if not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that these traits seem well-suited to this particular field:
- \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{avs}} = 0.3 \)

We now compute the overall probability \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) = 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{(0.2 \cdot 0.2)}{0.36} = \frac{0.04}{0.36} \approx 0.111 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35  \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{avs}} = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.1)}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

Based on these calculations, we have:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229
}
