Sure, let's break down the problem step-by-step using Bayes' Rule:

Bayes' Rule formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \(H\) given the evidence \(E\).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \(E\) given the hypothesis \(H\).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \(H\).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence's total probability, which can be expanded as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's determine these values for each field.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Computer science is a common field, so let's approximate the prior probability as 0.2 (20%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Although Adam is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, which aligns with computer science, the other aspects of his personality (curiosity about nature, love for animals) are less relevant. Assume \( P(E|H) \) is 0.1.

3. **Evidence Probability \( P(E) \)**
   - Since \(E\) must cover all possible fields, and given Adam's interests, let's assume \( P(E) \) is based on the sum of the likelihoods across all fields. For simplicity, we'll estimate it later.

4. **Complement likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - Given Adam's specific personality, assuming \( P(E|\neg H) \) varies depending on the field, let's initially say it's 0.5 (as a rough average for those incompatible with his spectrum).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - This is a less common field than computer science but still relevant for a nature and animal lover. Let's say the prior probability is 0.1 (10%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field. Assume \( P(E|H) \) is 0.7.

3. **Complement likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - For fields other than this one, the likelihood would generally be higher on average since they counterbalance against a very specialized fit. Let's consider \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.5.

For simplicity in calculating \( P(E) \), note that it's effectively a normalizing factor for the entire probability distribution. Since the resulting values would be proportional, we'll simplify calculations to reflect relative differences:

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1\cdot0.2 + 0.5\cdot(1-0.2)} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.4} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7\cdot0.1 + 0.5\cdot(1-0.1)} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.45} \approx \frac{0.07}{0.52} \approx 0.135 \]

Here are the results:
