Sure, let’s evaluate the probabilities for each given graduate field of specialization based on the information provided.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is not particularly high or low based on general student populations, say around 0.1.

- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s qualities — his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work — it is quite likely that he would fit well in this field. So, this could be a high probability, something like 0.8.

- **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of getting Adam's personality sketch if he were not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given that there are many fields where his personality might still fit (such as biology, environmental science, etc.), this might be around 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

Let's compute it:

\[ P(H|E)_{agri} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.4 \times 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{agri} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.36} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{agri} = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{agri} \approx 0.182 \]

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science, considering how common this field is among graduate students, might be higher, say around 0.2.

- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s qualities, especially his enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, it is somewhat likely he could be in Computer Science. However, his strong focus on nature and animals may slightly mitigate this. Let's assume a moderate probability, such as 0.5.

- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of getting Adam's personality sketch if he were not enrolled in Computer Science. Given his strong inclinations towards nature and animals, this could be around 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)} \]

Let's compute it:

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.5 \times 0.2 + 0.6 \times 0.8} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.48} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.1}{0.58} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} \approx 0.172 \]
