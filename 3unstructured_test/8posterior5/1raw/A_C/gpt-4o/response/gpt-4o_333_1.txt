To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) remains constant for both hypotheses, we can focus on the numerator:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Here's the breakdown for each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   
   - **\( P(H) \):** Let's assume the base rate (prior probability) \( P(H) \) that any given graduate student is enrolled in computer science is relatively high given the popularity of the field, say \( 0.3 \).
   
   - **\( P(E|H) \):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in computer science. Traits like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles fit well, but his strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature might not be closely related. Let's assign a medium likelihood, say \( 0.3 \).
   
   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in computer science (considering other fields). His traits might fit better in other fields, reducing this likelihood. Let's say \( 0.6 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

   - **\( P(H) \):** Let's assume the base rate \( P(H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is lower than computer science, say \( 0.1 \).

   - **\( P(E|H) \):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. His love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as a warm heart and strong empathy, highly suggest a good fit. Let's assign a high likelihood, say \( 0.8 \).

   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. His traits might be less common in other fields. Let's say \( 0.4 \).

Now we compute the posterior probabilities:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.3 = 0.09 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Normalizing these to sum up to 1:

Let \( P(E) = 0.09 + 0.08 = 0.17 \):

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.17} \approx 0.53 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.17} \approx 0.47 \]

The rough probabilities are as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.53,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.47
}

Please note that these values assume our initial priors and likelihoods which can be adjusted based on specific datasets or additional information.
