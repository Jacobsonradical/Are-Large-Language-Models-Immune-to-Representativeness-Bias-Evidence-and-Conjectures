To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to assess the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the respective field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the respective field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was *not* enrolled in the respective field.

Note: \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Considering the information given about Adam and standard assumptions, we can estimate the probabilities, though these values are hypothetical and based on subjective reasoning:

### Computer Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: There are many graduate programs, so let's assume a modest prior probability: \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: While computer science students can have empathy and enjoy puzzles, the specific focus on nature and animals is less common: assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not in Computer Science might be higher due to the fit with other possible fields: assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is a more specialized field, so a lower baseline prior probability is assumed: \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch fits well (love for nature, animals, empathy, appreciation for hard work): assume \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The personality sketch fits less with many other fields: assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \).

### Calculate Posterior Probabilities

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{0.6 \times 0.1 + 0.15 \times 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.195} \approx 0.308 \]

So, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308
}
```
