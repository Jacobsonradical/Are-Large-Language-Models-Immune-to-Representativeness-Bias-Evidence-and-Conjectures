To determine \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in any other field.

Bayes' rule is defined as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We are assuming that the fields are somewhat simplified for this thought experiment.

Let's evaluate \(\text{computer science}\) first:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science (approximating from general graduate enrollment data, and let's assume it to be 0.2).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches a typical computer science student. Given his abstract thinking but noting other aspects might not align as strongly (let's estimate 0.3).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches any other non-computer science field student. Let's put this at an average probability (around 0.7).

Now for \(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}\):
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The prior probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science (approximating from general graduate enrollment data, and let's assume it to be 0.05).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits a student in this field: high curiosity in nature/plants, love for animals (estimated to be quite high, let's say 0.8).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits a student from any other field (estimate around 0.6).

Let's assume \( P(E) \) is mostly coming from the presence of these hypotheses (normalized):

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}} )+ \text{other terms} \]

Given the probabilities to calculate:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + \text{other terms} \approx 0.06 + 0.04 + \text{other terms} \]

Now, we use Bayes' rule to find:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 + \text{other terms}} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.1 + \text{other terms}} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.1 + \text{other terms}} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.1 + \text{other terms}} \]

Assuming other terms diminish influence comparably:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.1 + \text{diminishing factors}} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.1} \approx 0.6 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.1 + \text{diminishing factors}} \approx 0.4 \]

Thus, providing results:
