To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in a field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch E given he is enrolled in the field H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch E given he is not enrolled in the field H.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam having the personality sketch E.

For simplicity, let's use some reasonable assumptions based on the information provided:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) \)
The prior probability can be assumed based on general enrollment statistics. Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.05 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \)
Given Adam's personality sketch, his characteristics seem highly aligning with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.9 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \)
The characteristics provided can fit other fields, but they are not as perfectly aligned. Thus, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

### Computer Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \)
The prior probability of being enrolled in Computer Science could also be assumed from general enrollment statistics. Letâ€™s assume \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.2 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \)
Given Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, this trait might match well, but not perfectly, with Computer Science. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.5 \).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \)
If Adam were not in Computer Science, the likelihood of the characteristics occurring might be fairly high as they are general and can fit other fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.4 \).

### Calculate Normalizing Constant \( P(E) \)

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agri}})P(H_{\text{agri}}) + P(E|H_{\text{cs}})P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}})P(\neg H_{\text{agri}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}})P(\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.5 \times 0.2) + (0.2 \times 0.95) + (0.4 \times 0.8) = 0.045 + 0.1 + 0.19 + 0.32 = 0.655 \]

### Computing Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}})P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.655} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.655} \approx 0.0687 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}})P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.655} \approx \frac{0.1}{0.655} \approx 0.1527 \]

Thus, the Bayesian posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.0687,
  "computer science": 0.1527
}
