To estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for Adam's potential enrollment in the specified fields, we need to consider the information given in the personality sketch and how it fits each field. Then, we can use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in this field.
     Let's assume this to be around 0.05 (5%), as it's a specialized field and not as common as others like computer science.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch would be true given that he is enrolled in this field.
     Given Adamâ€™s love for nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work, this likelihood is high. Let's assume 0.7 (70%).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch would be true given that he is not enrolled in this field.
     Since the traits described are somewhat general, but not highly common across all fields, let's assume 0.2 (20%).

2. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in this field.
     Let's assume this to be around 0.2 (20%), as computer science is a very popular graduate field.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch would be true given that he is enrolled in this field.
     Given his intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts, this likelihood is moderately high. Let's assume 0.4 (40%).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch would be true given that he is not enrolled in this field.
     Let's assume 0.2 (20%) as in the previous case.

Now, we apply Bayes' rule for each field:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) can be computed using:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.225} \approx 0.156 \]

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.2 \times 0.8) = 0.08 + 0.16 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.24} \approx 0.333 \]

Thus, the results expressed in JSON format are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.156,
  "computer science": 0.333
}
