To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the different fields using Bayes' rule, we need values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here's a step-by-step approach based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H_{\text{CS}})**: This represents the prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in Computer Science. Let's assume a generic prior, which we might estimate at around 20% given the popularity of the field.
     \[
     P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.20
     \]
   - **P(E|H_{\text{CS}})**: This is the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch aligns with someone studying Computer Science. Adam’s strong intelligence and love for solving puzzles fit well with this field, though his love for nature and animals is less relevant. We’ll estimate this at 0.5.
     \[
     P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5
     \]
   - **P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in Computer Science. Considering the variety of fields, let’s estimate it at 0.3.
     \[
     P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3
     \]
   - **P(H_{\text{CS}}|E)**: Using Bayes’ rule,
     \[
     P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)}
     \]
     where \( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \).

     Then,
     \[
     P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.20) + (0.3 \cdot 0.80) = 0.10 + 0.24 = 0.34
     \]
     So,
     \[
     P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.20}{0.34} \approx 0.294
     \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H_{\text{AVS}})**: Assuming a prior where maybe 5% of graduate students enroll in this field.
     \[
     P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.05
     \]
   - **P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})**: Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field. Estimate this likelihood at 0.8.
     \[
     P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8
     \]
   - **P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}})**: This is the probability of observing Adam's traits if he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's estimate it at 0.2.
     \[
     P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.2
     \]
   - **P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E)**: Using Bayes’ rule,
     \[
     P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)}
     \]
     where \( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \).

     Then,
     \[
     P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23
     \]
     So,
     \[
     P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.174
     \]

Combining these results, we conclude:

{
  "computer science": 0.294,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174
}
