To compute \(P(H|E)\) through Bayes' rule for each field, we use the formula: 

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in that field before knowing his personality sketch).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing the evidence (the personality sketch) given the hypothesis.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the probability of observing the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (Adam being in a different field).
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of observing the evidence across all possible fields.

Since we do not have numerical values for the priors and likelihoods, we will use qualitative reasoning to estimate them.

### Computer Science

- **P(H) for computer science**: Graduate enrollment is relatively high in computer science, so this might be moderately high but not too specific to Adam's traits.
- **P(E|H) for computer science**: Given the personality traits (love of nature, animals, solving puzzles), it's not particularly strong for computer science, although he does have high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
- **P(E|\neg H) for computer science**: The traits (empathy, love for nature, animals) are somewhat unusual for a typical computer science student but not impossible.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H) for agricultural and veterinary science**: This field is less common, but quite relevant given Adam's love for nature and animals.
- **P(E|H) for agricultural and veterinary science**: Very high. The personality sketch matches well with a student in this field.
- **P(E|\neg H) for agricultural and veterinary science**: Less likely, as the traits are less common among fields other than agricultural and veterinary science.

In terms of qualitative probability estimates:

#### Computer Science
- P(H): Moderate (~0.3)
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.3)
- P(E|\neg H): Low (~0.1)

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- P(H): Lower baseline (~0.1)
- P(E|H): Very High (~0.8)
- P(E|\neg H): Low (~0.1)

Given these qualitative estimates:

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H)
\]

#### Computer Science

\[
P(computer \, science|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09
\]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[
P(agricultural \, and \, veterinary \, science|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08
\]

Now normalizing these values (although not strictly necessary since OP said total does not need to add up to 1):

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(computer \, science|E) & \approx 0.53 \\
P(agricultural \, and \, veterinary \, science|E) & \approx 0.47 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

Given these rough estimates, we conclude:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.53,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.47
}
