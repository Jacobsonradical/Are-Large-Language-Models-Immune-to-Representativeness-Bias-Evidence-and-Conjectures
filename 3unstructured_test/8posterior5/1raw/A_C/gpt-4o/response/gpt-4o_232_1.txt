To evaluate the hypotheses (H) that Adam was enrolled in specific fields of study, we need to consider the given personality sketch (E) and calculate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). We will then use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) remains constant across all fields under consideration, comparing the values \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field would be sufficient to determine the relative likelihoods.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary sciences is relatively higher due to his interest in nature, plants, and animals.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (assuming moderate likelihood, but this can vary depending on specific demographic stats).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field is high. His traits, such as empathy, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work, align well with this field.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary sciences is lower but not negligible, as these traits could potentially fit other fields.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E)_{agriculture} \propto P(E|H)_{agriculture} \cdot P(H)_{agriculture} = 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in computer science is relatively high, given the general popularity and career prospects in this field.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.3 \) (assuming higher baseline due to the overall number of students in this field).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science is moderate. His intelligence and problem-solving skills are relevant here, but other traits like empathy and love for animals are less directly related.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in computer science could be similar to or higher than the specialization in agricultural sciences because these traits could fit various other fields.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

\[ P(H|E)_{computer_science} \propto P(E|H)_{computer_science} \cdot P(H)_{computer_science} = 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.15 \]

### Result

Based on these calculations, we can present the values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```

Therefore, the likelihood of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary sciences is higher based on his personality sketch, compared to computer science. Note that these values are illustrative and based on assumed probabilities; actual probabilities would require more specific data.
