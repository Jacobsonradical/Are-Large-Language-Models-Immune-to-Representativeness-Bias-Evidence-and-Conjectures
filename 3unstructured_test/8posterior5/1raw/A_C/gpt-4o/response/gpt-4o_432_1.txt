Let's break down the calculations in a step-by-step manner.

**Step 1: Define the Prior Probability, P(H)**
This is the prior belief regarding the probability that Adam is in a certain field without any additional information. 

Let's assume, based on general trends and the number of students typically enrolled in each field, that:
- P(H) for computer science (CS) is 0.3 (since CS is a popular field).
- P(H) for agricultural and veterinary science (Ag & Vet) is 0.1 (since it's a less common field compared to CS).

**Step 2: Define the Likelihood, P(E|H)**
This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch (E) fits within a given field (H).

Given the personality sketch of Adam:
- P(E|H) for computer science might be estimated as 0.2. While Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are relevant, his deep love for nature and animals is not typically associated with computer science, thus lowering this probability.
- P(E|H) for agricultural and veterinary science might be estimated as 0.7. Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals align very well with this field.

**Step 3: Define the Marginal Likelihood, P(E|\neg H)**
This is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field.

Assuming the remaining unspecified fields have a roughly equal share of likelihood:
- P(E|\neg H) for computer science could be estimated as 0.5. There are many fields besides CS where Adam's personality could fit (e.g., biology, environmental science).
- P(E|\neg H) for agricultural and veterinary science might be estimated as 0.3. Adam's traits are somewhat more unique to fields like Ag & Vet compared to many other fields.

**Step 4: Compute P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule**
Bayes' Rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be considered as a normalizing constant. It is often computed as the sum of the numerators of Bayes' rule across all possible hypotheses.

Let's denote \( P(E) \) as the sum of all evidence for both fields:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{Ag & Vet}) \cdot P(H_{Ag & Vet}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{Ag & Vet}) \cdot P(\neg H_{Ag & Vet}) \]

However, since we're interested in the individual probabilities and normalization isn't required for this purpose, we can focus on:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.5 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.35} = \frac{0.06}{0.41} \approx 0.146 \]

\[ P(H_{Ag \& Vet}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.27} = \frac{0.07}{0.34} \approx 0.206 \]

So, after making all these considerations, we get:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.146,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.206
}
```
