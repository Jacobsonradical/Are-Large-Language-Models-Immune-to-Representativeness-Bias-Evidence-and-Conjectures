In order to compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' Rule, which states: 

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

For simplicity, we will assess these values qualitatively based on the provided description and make plausible estimates.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H)**
- Hypothesis: Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in plants, this field seems likely.
- Let's assume \( P(H) \) is 0.2 (given that there are many other fields Adam could have chosen).

**P(E|H)**
- The evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch) strongly aligns with a student in this field.
- So, \( P(E|H) \) can be estimated quite high, let's say 0.7.

**P(E|\neg H)**
- The probability of having a similar personality sketch if Adam is not in this field might be lower but still possible in other related fields.
- Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) at around 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
To calculate \( P(E) \):

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38
\]

Thus,

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.38} \approx 0.368
\]

### Computer Science

**P(H)**
- Hypothesis: Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- Given Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, this field is also quite likely.
- Let's assume \( P(H) \) is also 0.2.

**P(E|H)**
- The evidence \( E \) partially aligns (interest in puzzles and abstract concepts) but doesnâ€™t fully match with nature and animals.
- So \( P(E|H) \) might be moderate, let's say 0.5.

**P(E|\neg H)**
- The sketch might fit other fields as well.
- Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) is similar to before, 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.1 + 0.24 = 0.34
\]

Thus,

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.294
\]
