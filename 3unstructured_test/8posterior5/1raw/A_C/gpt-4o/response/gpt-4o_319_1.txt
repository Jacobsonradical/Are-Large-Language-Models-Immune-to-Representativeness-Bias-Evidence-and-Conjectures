To compute the probabilities, we need to follow these steps:

1. Estimate \( P(H) \), the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he was enrolled in each field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he was NOT enrolled in each field.
4. Use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch.

Let's denote the fields as follows:
- \( H_1 \): Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( H_2 \): Computer Science

We'll make reasonable estimations and calculations for each step.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H_1) \)
Given no specific background information about Adam's likelihood of enrolling in this field, we can estimate roughly that the probability might be around 0.1 (or 10%) considering the variety of fields available.

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H_1) \)
Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, it is quite likely that he'd be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. So, \( P(E|H_1) \) could be estimated high, say 0.8 (or 80%).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_1) \)
This is the probability that Adam’s personality sketch would be observed if he were NOT in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering there are many fields Adam could be in, let's assume a lower probability, say 0.2 (or 20%).

#### Posterior Probability \( P(H_1|E) \)
Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
Given that \( P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1)P(\neg H_1) \):

\[ P(E) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

So,
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### 2. Computer Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H_2) \)
Similar to the previous field, let's assume a rough estimate of the probability might be around 0.1 (or 10%).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H_2) \)
Considering Adam’s enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, it’s reasonably likely but perhaps not as strong as the match to Agricultural/Veterinary. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_2) \approx 0.5 \) (or 50%).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_2) \)
This is the probability that Adam’s personality sketch would be observed if he were NOT in computer science. Given the variety of other fields, let's assume a probability similar to before, say 0.2 (or 20%).

#### Posterior Probability \( P(H_2|E) \)
Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]
Given that \( P(E) \) is the same as calculated above (0.26):

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} = \frac{0.05}{0.26} \approx 0.1923 \]

Here are the estimates:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
