To apply Bayes' theorem for calculating \( P(H|E) \) in each field, we'll first need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood under the complement \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's use the given personality sketch \( E \) and evaluate the hypotheses for each field.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **P(H)**: Prior Probability
    - Since we don’t have exact data, we'll assume a nominal prior value for simplicity. Typically, different fields might have varied enrollment rates, but without specific data, we might assume a uniform prior.

2. **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of \( E \) given the hypothesis.
    - This is the probability that Adam’s personality sketch matches someone likely to be in that field.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood of \( E \) given the hypothesis is false.
    - This is the probability that someone with Adam's characteristics is enrolled in any other graduate field.

Let's assign estimates based on general assumptions and apply Bayes' theorem:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**
    - Estimate: Since there's a smaller percentage of graduate students in Agricultural and Veterinary Science as compared to majors like business or engineering. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **P(E|H)**
    - High likelihood due to Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**
    - Given that empathy, intelligence, and love for nature are traits that could also fit many other fields less perfectly matched than Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \)

Simplifying:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.4 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.38 = 0.42 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.095 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**
    - Estimate: Computer Science is a popular field, so we might assign a higher prior value, say \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

2. **P(E|H)**
    - Moderate likelihood due to good at solving puzzles and high intelligence fitting the field well. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**
    - As before, empathy, intelligence, and love for nature can fit many other fields. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \times 0.15) + (0.4 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.075 + 0.34 = 0.415 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.15}{0.415} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.075}{0.415} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.181 \]

### Summary

Given the rough estimates and calculations based on the assumptions:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.095,
  "computer science": 0.181
}
```

These computations suggest that, based on Adam's personality sketch, there is a higher posterior probability that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science than Agricultural and Veterinary Science, although both values are relatively low given the whole pool of possible graduate fields.
