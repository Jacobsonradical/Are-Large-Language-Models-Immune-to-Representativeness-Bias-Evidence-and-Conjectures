To compute \( P(H|E) \), we start by using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

We will judge the values subjectively based on the given personality sketch and the fit to each field.

### Computer Science

#### Judging the Probabilities
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Let's assume the base rate of a student being in computer science among all graduate students is 0.2.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The probabilities that Adam's personality matches a computer science student. Given his traits like intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts, let's set this to 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): The probabilities that Adam's personality matches someone not in computer science. Considering he has a diverse set of traits, let's set this to 0.1.

#### Calculate \( P(H_{CS}|E) \):

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is common across all fields, it cancels out in the relative comparison.

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Judging the Probabilities:
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Let's assume the base rate of a student being in agricultural and veterinary science among all graduate students is 0.05.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): The probability that Adam's personality matches an agricultural and veterinary science student. Given his love for nature, animals, empathy, and strong appreciation for hard work, this should be quite high. Let's set it to 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): The probability that Adam's personality matches someone not in agricultural and veterinary science. Even though he has other applicable traits, it's likely lower. Let's set this to 0.2.

#### Calculate \( P(H_{AVS}|E) \):

\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) = 0.7 \times 0.05 = 0.035
\]

### Aggregated Results:
Normalizing only for comparison:

\[
\text{Normalization Factor} = 0.06 + 0.035 = 0.095
\]

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.095} \approx 0.632
\]

\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.095} \approx 0.368
\]

Thus, the final Bayesian probabilities for each field are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.632,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.368
}
```
