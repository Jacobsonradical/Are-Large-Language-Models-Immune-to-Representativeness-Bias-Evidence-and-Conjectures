To apply Bayes' rule in this context, we first need to define the conditional probabilities for each field. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field (H) given his personality sketch (E).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch (E) given that he is enrolled in that field (H).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Given we don’t have exact prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) or the exact likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \)), we need to make educated estimates to proceed:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Computer science is a common field for graduate students, so an arbitrary estimate might be 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam, given his personality traits, would be a computer science student might be low because his interests (nature, animals) and characteristics (high empathy) seem less aligned with the stereotypical computer science profile. Let’s assume 0.05.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of finding Adam’s personality sketch outside of computer science fields is higher. Let’s assume 0.8.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Agricultural and veterinary science is less common than computer science but more aligned with Adam's interests in nature and animals. Let's estimate it at 0.05.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s strong empathy and love for nature and animals, this probability is high, so we can assume 0.5.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's traits outside this field would be lower. Let's estimate it at 0.3.

By normalization against \( P(E) \) overall, which varies across contexts, we use relative comparisons:

For **Computer Science**:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Relative weighting (ignoring common denominators):

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \approx 0.01 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Agri}} \approx 0.025 \]

Normalizing sum is greater, relative probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.025
