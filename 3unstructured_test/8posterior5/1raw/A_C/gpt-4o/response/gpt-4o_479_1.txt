To use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). The marginal likelihood can be broken down into \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \). Since we're dealing with multiple hypotheses, the values won't necessarily add up to 1.

First, we make reasonably subjective estimates for each of these probabilities:

1. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Let's assume a moderate prior due to the popularity of the field: 0.2 (20%).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in computer science. Given that the sketch highlights an interest in nature and animals, traits more associated with agricultural sciences, we'd estimate a lower likelihood: 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in computer science. Since we're only given another field explicitly, estimating across multiple hypotheses, let's assume this to be higher: 0.9 (90%).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field aligns well with his personality sketch, let's assume a moderate prior: 0.3 (30%).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. His interests match this field well, so let's estimate this high: 0.9 (90%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Assuming similar distribution with other fields, let's keep this lower: 0.2 (20%).

Now compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for both fields:

For Computer Science:
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.2)}{ [(0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.9 \cdot 0.8)] } = \frac{0.02}{0.74} \approx 0.027
\]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{(0.9 \cdot 0.3)}{ [(0.9 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7)] } = \frac{0.27}{0.41} \approx 0.659
\]

Now presenting the answers:
