Let's start by analyzing what we know about Adam and how that information influences the probabilities for each of the two fields (agricultural and veterinary science, and computer science).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is 5%.
  
- **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of Adam having the described personality traits given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, I would estimate this to be high, let's say 0.8.

- **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of Adam having the described personality traits given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. His traits are somewhat aligned with other fields but not as strongly. Let's estimate this at 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is unknown, we will compute the proportional influence:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Given the popularity of the field, let's assume this is 15%.
  
- **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of Adam having the described personality traits given that he is in computer science. While he has high intelligence and an interest in puzzles which aligns, his other traits are less related. Let's put this at 0.4.

- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam having these traits if he is not in computer science. As before, we estimated this to be around 0.2.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.15 = 0.06 \]

Now let's summarize in the requested format:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.06
}
```

This indicates that based on Adam’s personality sketch, while both probabilities are relatively low, it appears more likely that he is enrolled in computer science than in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the given proportions.
