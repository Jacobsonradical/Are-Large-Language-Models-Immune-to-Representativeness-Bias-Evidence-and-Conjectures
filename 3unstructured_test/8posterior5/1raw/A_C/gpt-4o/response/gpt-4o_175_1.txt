Let's start by analyzing the available information and making educated guesses based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

### Hypothesis and Probabilities:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability for each field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: A moderate likelihood, considering that this field typically attracts people interested in nature, animals, and dedicated work.
  - Let's assign it a value of 0.15.
- **P(E|H)**: High, because Adam's love for animals, empathy, and interest in nature are a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Let's assign it a value of 0.7.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of a similar personality sketch existing in a different field. Given Adam's empathetic nature and interest in animals, personality sketch E might be less common in other fields.
  - Let's assign it a value of 0.3.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: A moderate likelihood, considering that this field attracts people who enjoy solving puzzles and have a high intelligence.
  - Let's assign it a value of 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Moderate, because while Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills fit, his empathy and interest in nature and animals are less typical for computer science students.
  - Let's assign it a value of 0.4.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of a similar personality sketch existing in another field, where these characteristics might variably fit.
  - Let's assign it a value of 0.5.

### Bayes Rule Calculation:
Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \)

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.15) + (0.3 \times 0.85) \)
- \( P(E) = 0.105 + 0.255 \)
- \( P(E) = 0.36 \)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.15}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.105}{0.36} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2917 \]

#### For Computer Science:
- \( P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times 0.8) \)
- \( P(E) = 0.08 + 0.4 \)
- \( P(E) = 0.48 \)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1667 \]

### Final Answers:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2917,
  "computer science": 0.1667
}
