Let's denote:

- \(E\): The personality sketch of Adam
- \(H\): The hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field
- \(\neg H\): The hypothesis that Adam was not enrolled in that specific field

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To compute \(P(H|E)\), we need the following probabilities:
1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was enrolled in the field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was not enrolled in the field.

Since \(P(E)\) can be scaled out as it is the same for both fields, we will focus on relative values.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Prior Probability, P(H):**
Let's assume the field of agricultural and veterinary science is reasonably popular but less so than fields like computer science.
\[ P(H_{\text{ag/vet}}) = 0.1 \]

**Likelihood, P(E|H):**
Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with his personality.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{ag/vet}}) = 0.8 \]

**Likelihood, P(E|\neg H):**
To find this, we can approximate the likelihood of his personality sketch if he were in another field. Let's consider an average value accounting for various other fields.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag/vet}}) = 0.4 \]

### Computer Science

**Prior Probability, P(H):**
Computer science is a highly popular field with many students. 
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.3 \]

**Likelihood, P(E|H):**
While Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit, his strong empathy and love for animals may not be as directly relevant to computer science.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.3 \]

**Likelihood, P(E|\neg H):**
As before, we'll use an average value.
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.4 \]

### Bayes Rule Calculations

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{ag/vet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag/vet}}) P(H_{\text{ag/vet}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) can be the same in both cases, we only compare the numerators:

\[ P(H_{\text{ag/vet}}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \]

Normalizing these to sum up to 1 for comparison:

\[ Total = 0.08 + 0.09 = 0.17 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{ag/vet}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.17} \approx 0.47 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.17} \approx 0.53 \]
