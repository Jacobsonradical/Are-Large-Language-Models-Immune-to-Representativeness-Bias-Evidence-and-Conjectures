Let's first consider the probabilities:

1. **P(H) - The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field:**
   - Computer Science: Let's assume a generic prior probability of 0.2 (20%). This is based on the high enrollment rates in this field in graduate studies.
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Let's assume a generic prior probability of 0.05 (5%). This field has lower enrollment rates compared to fields like computer science.

2. **P(E|H) - The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in H:**
   - Computer Science: Given Adam's characteristics of high intelligence and problem-solving abilities, let's set this as 0.3 (30%). The curiosity about nature and love for animals do not strongly align with this field.
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam’s attributes such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and strong empathy, we might set this higher, around 0.7 (70%).

3. **P(E|¬H) - The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in H:**
   - Computer Science: Based on Adam's personality sketch, if he is not in Computer Science, the probability that he has this combination of characteristics may be around 0.1 (10%).
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: If Adam is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, his profile might not fit well, suggesting a probability of around 0.2 (20%).

Now applying Bayes Rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.1 \times 0.8 \]
\[ = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.14} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.4286 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.95 \]
\[ = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.225} = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \approx 0.1556 \]

Our final computed values:
