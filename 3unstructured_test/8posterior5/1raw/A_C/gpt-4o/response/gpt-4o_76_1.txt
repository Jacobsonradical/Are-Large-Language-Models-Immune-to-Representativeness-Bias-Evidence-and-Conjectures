To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to first determine the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can simplify as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

To apply this, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch and the nature of the fields of study.

### Computer Science
- **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\)):** Let's approximate \( P(\text{Computer Science}) \) for a graduate student to be moderately high, given the popularity of the field.
  \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.2 \)

- **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\)):** Adam's empathy, curiosity about nature, and love for animals might not strongly align with typical motivations for pursuing computer science, although his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills do.
  \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.3 \)

- **Likelihood (\(P(E|\neg H)\)):** The probability that Adam has the described personality traits given that he is not in computer science could be relatively high, as these traits align more with other fields.
  \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.7 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\)):** Let's estimate \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \) to be lower due to fewer students typically enrolled in these fields compared to computer science.
  \( P(\text{AgVet}) = 0.05 \)

- **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\)):** Adam's traits strongly align with those usually found in fields related to nature, animals, and empathy.
  \( P(E|\text{AgVet}) = 0.8 \)

- **Likelihood (\(P(E|\neg H)\)):** The probability of having Adam's traits in other fields (excluding those directly tied with nature) would still be there but lower.
  \( P(E|\neg \text{AgVet}) = 0.5 \)

Given these assumptions, we can now use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities.

For \( \text{Computer Science} \):

\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\neg \text{CS}) \cdot P(\neg \text{CS})}
\]

\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{(0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.8)}
\]

\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.56}
\]

\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \approx 0.097
\]

For \( \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} \):

\[
P(\text{AgVet}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{AgVet}) \cdot P(\text{AgVet})}{P(E|\text{AgVet}) \cdot P(\text{AgVet}) + P(E|\neg \text{AgVet}) \cdot P(\neg \text{AgVet})}
\]

\[
P(\text{AgVet}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{(0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.5 \cdot 0.95)}
\]

\[
P(\text{AgVet}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.475}
\]

\[
P(\text{AgVet}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.515} \approx 0.078
\]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.097,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.078
}
\]
