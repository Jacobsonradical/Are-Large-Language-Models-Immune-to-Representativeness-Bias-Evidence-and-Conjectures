To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam is enrolled in a certain field given his personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, let's outline the probabilities we need:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \): Total probability of Adam's personality sketch.

Since we do not have exact numerical values, we will estimate them based on qualitative reasoning:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **\( P(H) \)**: 
   - **Estimate**: Agricultural and veterinary science is a relatively specialized field.
   - **Value**: Let's assign a moderate prior, say 0.3 (since it's a bit more specialized than broader fields like computer science but still a common graduate path).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**:
   - **Estimate**: Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy are highly compatible with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **Value**: High likelihood, say 0.8.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - **Estimate**: In other fields, while Adam's traits are beneficial, they are not as perfectly aligned as with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **Value**: Lower likelihood, say 0.4.

Using Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, we can consider:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

### Computer Science
1. **\( P(H) \)**: 
   - **Estimate**: Computer science is a very common field of graduate study.
   - **Value**: Higher prior probability, say 0.4.

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**:
   - **Estimate**: While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence fit well with computer science, his deep love for nature and animals is less directly relevant.
   - **Value**: Moderate likelihood, say 0.5.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - **Estimate**: Similar reasoning as before, traits are valuable but not perfectly aligned with computer science.
   - **Value**: Moderate likelihood, say 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2 \]

### Summary of Results Using Normalized Values
To compare the results, we have:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.24
- Computer Science: 0.2

However, these values are not normalized. To normalize:

### Normalizing
\[ \text{Total} = 0.24 + 0.2 = 0.44 \]

\[ P(\text{Agri. and Vet. Sci.} | E) = \frac{0.24}{0.44} \approx 0.545 \]
\[ P(\text{Comp. Sci.} | E) = \frac{0.2}{0.44} \approx 0.455 \]
