To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to evaluate the relevant probabilities. 

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field:

1. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science (without any additional information about his personality). Considering the popularity of computer science, especially among high-intelligence students, let's assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.15 \).
   
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in computer science. Computer science students may have problem-solving skills and high intelligence, but the deep love for nature and animals might not be as strongly associated. Therefore, let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1 \).
    
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in computer science. This is hard to estimate directly, but let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.05 \), recognizing that traits like empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work might be found in many other fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (without any additional information about his personality). This field is less common compared to computer science, so let's assume \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.05 \).
   
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. The traits described fit very well with agricultural and veterinary science, so let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.9 \).

   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Similar to the above, but since this personality is quite fitting for this field, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.1 \).

Since \( P(E) \) is common to both fields and can be ignored for comparison purposes, we'll calculate the numerator for both fields and then compute the proportional probabilities.

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1 \times 0.15 = 0.015 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}})P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.9 \times 0.05 = 0.045 \]

Now, normalize these to get the proportional probabilities:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) &= \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.045} = 0.25 \\
P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) &= \frac{0.045}{0.015 + 0.045} = 0.75
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, the final results using Bayes' rule are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
