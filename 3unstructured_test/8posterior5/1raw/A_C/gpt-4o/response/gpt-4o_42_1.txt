To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch. This can be calculated using the law of total probability.

To simplify things, we'll assume \( P(E) \) remains constant for each field and focus on estimating \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   - The proportion of graduate students in the U.S. enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences is smaller compared to more general fields like Computer Science.
   - Estimate: \( P(H) = 0.05 \)

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy, it is highly likely he fits well into this field.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)

3. **Likelihood for Not Enrolled, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Adam's personality sketch is somewhat specific but could still fit into other fields; it might be less likely compared to Agricultural Sciences.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

**Computer Science**

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   - The proportion of graduate students in the U.S. enrolled in Computer Science is relatively high.
   - Estimate: \( P(H) = 0.15 \)

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, he could fit into Computer Science although his love for nature and animals isn't a strong match.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \)

3. **Likelihood for Not Enrolled, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - His characteristics are less specific to Computer Science but not entirely unrelated.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, we can calculate relative probabilities without it:

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.15 = 0.06 \]

To convert these to probabilities sum to 1 for just these fields:

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.06} = \frac{0.04}{0.10} = 0.4 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.04 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.10} = 0.6 \]

Therefore:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.6
