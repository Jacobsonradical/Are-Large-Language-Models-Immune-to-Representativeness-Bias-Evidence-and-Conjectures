Given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), let us analyze the two given fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H)**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is about 0.05 (5%).

**P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, appreciation of hard work, and curiosity about nature fit well with this field. Let's assign a high value, say 0.8 (80%).

**P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that many other fields might not fully align with Adam's characteristics, we might assign this a moderate value, say 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' Rule, \( P(H|E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) (the marginal probability of \( E \)) needs normalization for all possible fields, we will calculate the proportionality without normalizing to 1 here:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

### Computer Science
**P(H)**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume this is about 0.15 (15%).

**P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science. Adam's interest in puzzles and high intelligence are characteristics that fit well with computer science, but his empathy and love for nature and animals are less directly related. Let's assign this a moderate value, say 0.4 (40%).

**P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in computer science. As before, we will use the same value, 0.2 (20%).

For computer science:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.15 = 0.06 \]

### Result:
Now, we present our unnormalized probabilities without normalizing to 1:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.06
}
```

Note: To compute the exact \( P(H|E) \), you would need to normalize these values by dividing each by the sum of the values across all possible fields. However, as instructed, we are not required to normalize here.
