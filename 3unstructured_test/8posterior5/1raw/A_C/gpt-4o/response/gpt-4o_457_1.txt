To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch \( E \), we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field, \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field, \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field, and \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Let's estimate these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This represents the chance of Adam being enrolled in a particular field without any additional information. We'll assume:
   - There are many fields of graduate study, so \( P(H) \) for a specific field might be small.
   - Let's assign \( P(H) \) roughly as follows (these are assumptions based on the U.S. graduate student distribution):
     - \( P(H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science: 0.05
     - \( P(H) \) for computer science: 0.1

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in that field:
   - For agricultural and veterinary science:
     - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and animals, which aligns well with this field.
     - Estimate \( P(E|H) \) at 0.7
   - For computer science:
     - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which fits the field, but his deep love for nature and animals is less relevant.
     - Estimate \( P(E|H) \) at 0.3

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is not in a specific field:
   - For agricultural and veterinary science:
     - \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be lower since the personality sketch is highly specific to this field.
     - Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) at 0.2
   - For computer science:
     - \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be higher, as the traits such as high intelligence and solving puzzles could fit many other fields.
     - Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) at 0.5

4. **Overall Probability \( P(E) \)**: This is harder to quantify without specific data, but for simplicity, we'll assume:
   - \( P(E) \) is roughly equal across fields.
   - Estimate \( P(E) = 0.1 \) as a placeholder value for normalization.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.1} = 0.35 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.1} = 0.3 \]

Summarizing the results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Again, note that these values are not meant to sum up to 1 as they only represent the relative likelihoods for the specified fields given the personality sketch provided.
