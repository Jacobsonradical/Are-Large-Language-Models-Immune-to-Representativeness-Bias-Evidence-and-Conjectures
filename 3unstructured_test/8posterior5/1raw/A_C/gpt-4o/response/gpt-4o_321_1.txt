To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to calculate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that he was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence.

Given the qualitative description and not having exact probabilities, let's make some reasonable qualitative assessments:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H_agriculture)**:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science seems likely given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals. Let's assume a relatively high prior.
   - Let's assign a qualitative prior probability \( P(H_{agriculture}) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H_agriculture)**:
   - Adam’s characteristics like love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and curiosity about nature strongly align with this field. Therefore, the likelihood is high.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H_{agriculture}) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H_agriculture)**:
   - Adam’s characteristics might still align somewhat with other fields, especially those related to nature or abstract concepts, but let's assume the likelihood is moderate.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H_{agriculture}) = 0.4 \).

### Computer Science
1. **P(H_computer_science)**:
   - Given Adam's intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, computer science is plausible. Still, it might be less likely than fields directly related to nature.
   - Let's assign \( P(H_{computer_science}) = 0.15 \).

2. **P(E|H_computer_science)**:
   - His puzzle-solving skills and intelligence align well with this field, but his other traits like empathy and love for animals are not directly related.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H_{computer_science}) = 0.5 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H_computer_science)**:
   - Adam’s characteristics might be somewhat less aligned with other fields unrelated to both nature and abstract problem-solving. The complement probability would be relatively moderate.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H_{computer_science}) = 0.4 \).

### Calculation
To apply Bayes' Rule, let's consider \( P(E) \) as the normalizing constant:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{agriculture}) \cdot P(H_{agriculture}) + P(E|H_{computer_science}) \cdot P(H_{computer_science}) + P(E|\neg (H_{agriculture} \cup H_{computer_science})) \cdot P(\neg (H_{agriculture} \cup H_{computer_science})) \]

Let's approximate \( P(E) \) for simplicity, although it would normally require all possible fields:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.15 + 0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.35) \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.16 + 0.075 + 0.26 = 0.495 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agriculture}) \cdot P(H_{agriculture})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.495} \approx 0.323 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{computer_science}) \cdot P(H_{computer_science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.15}{0.495} \approx 0.152 \]
