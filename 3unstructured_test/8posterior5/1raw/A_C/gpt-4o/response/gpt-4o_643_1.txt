First, let's define the terms needed for applying Bayes' rule:

- **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given Adam is enrolled in the field.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given Adam is not enrolled in the field.
- **P(H|E)**: Posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field given the personality sketch E.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Given that "agricultural and veterinary science" fits more closely with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, it's likely that the probabilities associated with agricultural and veterinary science will be higher.

Assume the following reasonable values (subject to adjustment based on real data):

### Computer Science
- **P(H)** (Prior for Computer Science): 0.2 (relatively common graduate field)
- **P(E|H)** (Likelihood of the sketch given Computer Science): 0.1 (less likely to closely fit the personality sketch)
- **P(E|¬H)** (Likelihood of sketch given other fields): Let's assume the mean value of not being in Computer Science is slightly higher because more fields could align with the interest in nature etc., so say 0.12.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.12 \cdot 0.8)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.096} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.116} \approx 0.172 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)** (Prior for Agricultural and Veterinary Science): 0.1 (less common graduate field)
- **P(E|H)** (Likelihood of the sketch given Agricultural and Veterinary Science): 0.6 (highly likely given Adam's personality traits)
- **P(E|¬H)** (Likelihood of sketch given other fields): Again, let's assume a mean value sans agricultural and veterinary science would be slightly lower, say 0.15.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{(0.6 \cdot 0.1) + (0.15 \cdot 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.195} \approx 0.308 \]

Summarized values for the two fields:
