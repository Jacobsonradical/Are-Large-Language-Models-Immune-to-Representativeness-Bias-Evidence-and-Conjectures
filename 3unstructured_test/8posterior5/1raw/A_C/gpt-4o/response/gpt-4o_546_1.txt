To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we need to understand and estimate the various probabilities involved.

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field. This requires an understanding of the distribution of graduate students across different fields, but we'll use a neutral hypothesis for each field and set this value to be the same for both fields.

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the likelihood that we would observe Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the likelihood that we would observe Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in a specific field.

4. **P(E)**: This normalizing constant can be computed but it's not necessary here because we are comparing relative probabilities.

Let's proceed with estimates:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Assuming a neutral likelihood, we start with a baseline of roughly 0.1 (10%) based on the wide variety of fields available.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adamâ€™s characteristics like a love for nature, plants, and animals, a warm heart, and strong empathy, we can estimate this to be quite high, around 0.9.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming that these characteristics are not so common in the general graduate population, let's estimate this be around 0.3.

   So, to calculate \( P(H|E) \):
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

   Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we focus on the numerator:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Again, using a neutral approach, we start with a baseline of roughly 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's skills in solving puzzles and high intelligence, it aligns well with computer science but lacks the nature and animal aspects. Let's estimate this probability at around 0.4.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming these tech skills and interests in abstraction are more common in the general graduate population, let's use the same 0.3 for the sake of comparison.

   So, calculation for \( P(H|E) \):
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04
   \]

In summary:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.04
}
```

These estimates suggest that given Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Computer Science.
