Let's consider the personality sketch of Adam and evaluate the probabilities concerning his potential enrollment in either Agricultural and Veterinary Science or Computer Science.

We need to compute:

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.
  
Finally, we'll use Bayes' Rule to find the posterior probability, **P(H|E)**:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given that **P(E)** is common to all computations, we'll focus on relative probabilities for clarity. Here's the evaluation step by step for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H):** Given the personality sketch with a focus on nature and animals, and assuming a general distribution of students across fields, the prior probability might be moderate.
   \[
   P(H)_{Agri} \approx 0.2
   \]

2. **P(E|H):** Adam’s traits align quite well with this field. High curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals are strong indicators.
   \[
   P(E|H)_{Agri} \approx 0.9
   \]

3. **P(E|¬H):** For this calculation, denote the other fields where students might still share these broad interests but to a lesser extent.
   \[
   P(E|¬H)_{Agri} \approx 0.4
   \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** Given its popularity, there's a higher base rate of graduate students enrolled in Computer Science.
   \[
   P(H)_{CS} \approx 0.3
   \]

2. **P(E|H):** Adam’s traits do not perfectly align with typical Computer Science students, though skills like puzzle-solving and high intelligence are relevant.
   \[
   P(E|H)_{CS} \approx 0.4 \text{ to be generous}
   \]

3. **P(E|¬H):** Assume the remaining students in a similar trait distribution but different fields.
   \[
   P(E|¬H)_{CS} \approx 0.6
   \]

Now compute **P(H|E)** for each field. Since **P(E)** is the same across computations, the relative probabilities (focused on the numerator of Bayes' formula) are compared proportionately.

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{Agri}} \propto P(E|H)_{Agri} \times P(H)_{Agri} = 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto P(E|H)_{CS} \times P(H)_{CS} = 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12
\]

Normalize such that their sum isn't forced to 1 but reflects relative belief:

\[
P(H|E)_{Agri} = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.12} = 0.6
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.12}{0.18 + 0.12} = 0.4
\]

So the approximate probabilities that Adam is enrolled in each field are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Take these results as indicative rather than precise due to the lack of precise prior distributions and likelihoods.
