To answer the question using Bayes' Theorem, we need to assess the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing evidence \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the specified field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing evidence \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the specified field.

We can then use Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant that ensures probabilities sum to 1, we can ignore it for relative comparisons.

### Assessing the Probabilities

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a reasonable prior for agricultural and veterinary science as 0.1, given that it's a somewhat specialized field.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, appreciation for hard work), this field fits very well. We'll assign a high likelihood, say 0.8.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given the specific traits, they might be less likely in other fields, so we assign a relatively lower value, say 0.2.

#### Computer Science:

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a common and popular field. Let's assume a prior of 0.2.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's personality traits (high intelligence, solving puzzles) fit reasonably well with this field but not as well as agricultural and veterinary science. We assign a moderate likelihood, say 0.4.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Traits like a love for animals and curiosity about nature might be less indicative of someone not in computer science, so let's use 0.6.

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities

Using Bayes' rule for each field, we get:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.08 / P(E) \]

2. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.08 / P(E) \]

Since \( P(E) \) is identical in both equations, we don't need to compute it for relative comparisons.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
```

The results show equal posterior support for both fields based on the given evidence and our assumed probabilities.

### Refinement

Upon further reflection, it might be reasonable to slightly adjust depending on more intrinsic accuracy about the probabilities or contexts. But with the current information:
- Both values are internally consistent and proportionate. 

Thus, based on the evidence and the assumptions made:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
```
