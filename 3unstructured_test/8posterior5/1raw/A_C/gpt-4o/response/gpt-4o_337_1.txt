Certainly, let's evaluate the probabilities considering Adam's personality traits and his field of study.

First, we need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \) that Adam was enrolled in each field. Assuming no prior bias, we can start with an equal probability for each field. For simplicity, let’s assume there are 10 possible fields he could be in. Therefore \( P(H) \) for each field could be approximated as 0.1.

However, let's adjust these probabilities based on general trends. For example, we might consider fewer graduate students are in agriculture compared to fields like computer science, so we will make slight adjustments:

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.05
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.1
\]

Secondly, we need to estimate the plausibility \( P(E|H) \) that Adam's personality sketch fits each specialization. Given his love for nature, animals, and empathy, agricultural and veterinary sciences seem quite compatible. The fit with computer science might be less so, albeit possible.

\[
P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.8
\]

\[
P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.4
\]

Thirdly, we need to estimate the probability \( P(E|\neg H) \) that Adam’s personality would be observed given he’s not in the considered fields. Since his traits are general and could apply to various fields:

\[
P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.5
\]

\[
P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.5
\]

Now, we can use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is common across all hypotheses, we focus on the numerator for comparisons:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.4 \times 0.1} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.04} = 0.5
\]

For computer science:
\[
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.4 \times 0.1} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.04} = 0.5
\]

After normalizing to total probability:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
\]

However, since we typically normalize them:
Each value should be considered relative to P(E). Hence, we need to consider appropriate normalization, adjusting for total approaches 1:

Final format would become:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.63,
  "computer science": 0.37
}
\]

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.63,
  "computer science": 0.37
}
