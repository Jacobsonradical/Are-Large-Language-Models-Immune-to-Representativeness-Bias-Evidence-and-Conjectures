Let's evaluate the probabilities first and then compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule.

As a reminder:

- P(H) = The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- P(E|H) = The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- P(E|\neg H) = The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
- P(H|E) = The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given the personality sketch.

Given the provided information, let's make a reasonable assessment.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)** (Prior Probability): Let's assume the general likelihood of a graduate being in computer science is relatively high given the popularity of the field. Let's set P(H) = 0.25.
- **P(E|H)** (Likelihood): Given the personality sketch, interests, and traits such as high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, there is a moderate-to-high likelihood that Adam could be in computer science. Set P(E|H) = 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)** (Likelihood of evidence if not in this field): Graduate students from other fields may also have these traits. Let's set P(E|\neg H) = 0.15.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)** (Prior Probability): This field is less common exclusively in general comparison but relevant given the personality sketch. Let's set P(H) = 0.05.
- **P(E|H)** (Likelihood): Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, there would be a high likelihood he is in this field. Set P(E|H) = 0.7.
- **P(E|\neg H)** (Likelihood of evidence if not in this field): Personality traits of warm heart and empathy are common but not necessarily indicative of a specific field. Let's set P(E|\neg H) = 0.15.

### Bayes' Rule Calculation
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We will compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

#### For Computer Science:
1. \( P(E) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.25 + 0.15 \cdot 0.75 = 0.075 + 0.1125 = 0.1875 \)
2. \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.1875} = \frac{0.075}{0.1875} \approx 0.4 \)

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. \( P(E) \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.15 \cdot 0.95 = 0.035 + 0.1425 = 0.1775 \)
2. \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.1775} = \frac{0.035}{0.1775} \approx 0.197 \)

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.197
}
