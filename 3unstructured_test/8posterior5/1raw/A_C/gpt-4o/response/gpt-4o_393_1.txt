To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam's fields of study, we will need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that there are multiple factors to consider, we will make educated estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) as follows:

1. **Prior probabilities** \( P(H) \): the initial probabilities that Adam is studying in each field without additional information \( E \).

2. **Likelihoods** \( P(E|H) \): the probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) would be true if he were studying in each field.

3. **Marginal likelihood** \( P(E|\neg H) \): the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is not in the specified field \( H \).

Let's estimate these values based on the information provided:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: Prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it's relatively low but non-negligible, say 0.10 (10%).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that someone in this field has Adam's personality traits (such as a love for nature, empathy, and a deep love for animals). This is likely high, say 0.80 (80%).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood that someone not in this field has these traits. This might be lower, perhaps 0.20 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: Prior probability that a random graduate student is in computer science. Given the popularity of this field, let's assume it's somewhat high, say 0.20 (20%).
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that someone in this field has Adam's personality traits (puzzle-solving fits, but other traits, such as love for nature and animals, might be less common). Let's estimate 0.30 (30%).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Similar to the previous case, the likelihood that someone not in this field has these traits. Let's assume 0.20 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:

Given that \( P(E) \) is constant for each calculation and determines the normalizing factor, we can focus on the numerator for relative comparison:

### Calculation
#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a common term and we are asked for a value between 0 and 1 to denote relative likelihood, we need to normalize these values. The sum of these probabilities is proportional to generating each component probability.

For simplicity and direct comparison:

- Let's denote the likelihood ratio for Agricultural and Veterinary Science relative to sum (0.08 + 0.06):

\[ P(H|E)_{AGS} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.06} = \frac{0.08}{0.14} \approx 0.57 \]

- Similarly, for Computer Science:

\[  P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.06}{0.08 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.43 \]

Thus, we have:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57,
  "computer science": 0.43
}
```

These computed values give a relative probability based on the given information and assumptions.
