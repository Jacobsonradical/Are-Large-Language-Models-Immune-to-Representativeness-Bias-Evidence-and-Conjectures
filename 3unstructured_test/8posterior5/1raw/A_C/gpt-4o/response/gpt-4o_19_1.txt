To evaluate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, I need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each mentioned field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he was enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he was not enrolled in a particular field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits.

Using Bayes' rule: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both fields and we're comparing the relative probabilities, we can disregard \( P(E) \) for this comparison:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's interests and personality, it's reasonable to assume there's a significant, but not overwhelming, chance. Let's estimate it at 0.25.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits if he is enrolled in this field is relatively high because of his genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals. Assume 0.85.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described traits if he is not enrolled in this field. This could be lower, as his traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Estimate this at 0.3.

### Computer Science
- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Given his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, this is moderate. Let's estimate it at 0.2.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that Adam has these traits if he is in computer science. While it does align with his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, it is less aligned with his empathy and love for nature. Assume 0.4.
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described traits if he is not in computer science. This could be moderate, as these traits can be found in many people with various interests. Estimate at 0.6.

### Calculation
Now, we calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, proportional to \( P(E|H)P(H) \):

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.85 \times 0.25 = 0.2125 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Normalize these values if needed, but relative comparison gives us the following:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2125,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
