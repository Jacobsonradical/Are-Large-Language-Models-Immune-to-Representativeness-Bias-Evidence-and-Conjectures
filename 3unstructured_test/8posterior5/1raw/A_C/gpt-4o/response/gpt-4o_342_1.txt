To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to assess the prior probability \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without exact values, we will make some reasonable estimates based on the given personality sketch. Let's evaluate each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, we can assume this field has a relatively high probability. Let's estimate it as 0.2.

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field since it involves nature, animals, and empathy. Let's estimate it as 0.9.

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: If Adam were not in this field, his personality traits are still compatible with other fields related to nature and abstract thinking but less so. Let's estimate this likelihood as 0.4.

### Computer Science

- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: While Adam has high intelligence and good abstract thinking skills — attributes that fit computer science well — his strong empathy, and love for nature and animals might make this less likely. Let's estimate it as 0.1.

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: His intelligence and problem-solving skills align with computer science, but the love for nature and empathy are not as clear a fit. Let's estimate it as 0.4.

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: If Adam were not in computer science, his personality would still fit reasonably well in other fields, especially those related to nature and animals. Let's estimate this as 0.8.

Now applying Bayes' rule:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.4 \cdot 0.1 + 0.8 \cdot (1 - 0.1)} \]

Simplifying these calculations, we get:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.32} = \frac{0.18}{0.50} = 0.36 \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.72} = \frac{0.04}{0.76} \approx 0.053 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36,
  "computer science": 0.053
}
