To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specific field (i.e., computer science or agricultural and veterinary science).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the specific field.

Using Bayes' Rule, \( P(H|E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that the actual prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the exact values of \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) are not provided, we will make reasonable assumptions to estimate these values based on general knowledge and the given personality sketch.

Let's estimate the probabilities as follows:

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Graduate enrollment in computer science is quite common. Let's assume a higher prior probability for computer science. 
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3
   \]
2. **\( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Adam's personality sketch with strong empathy, love for animals, and an interest in nature is less typical for computer science students but not impossible.
   \[
   P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2
   \]
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Given that Adam's personality sketch fits better with other fields (like agricultural and veterinary science), the probability of observing his personality sketch if he is not in computer science is higher.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.5
   \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)**: Enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science is less common compared to computer science.
   \[
   P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.1
   \]
2. **\( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)**: Adam's personality sketch fits well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science (love for nature, animals, and empathy).
   \[
   P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.8
   \]
3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)**: The probability of observing his personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science should be lower, given how well it fits.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.3
   \]

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \) is the same for both conditions and simplifying the comparison:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
\]

Given these estimates, we normalize them to account for probabilities adding up.

Therefore, the conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
```
