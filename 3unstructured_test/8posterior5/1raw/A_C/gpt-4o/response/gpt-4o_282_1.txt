To estimate the probabilities, we will use the information provided in Adam's personality sketch and Bayes' theorem. Here’s the plan: 

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the personality traits described, given he is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the personality traits described, given he is not enrolled in that field.
4. Use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field given his personality traits.

### Step-by-step estimation

#### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: To be intuitive, let's roughly assume that in graduate school, the enrollment might be evenly distributed among many fields. Hence, prior \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.1 \) (this is subjective and can vary).

2. **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, it is plausible. So, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The chance of having the same personality traits in any other field. Given that these are not strongly predictive of a non-CS student but likely common across many analytical and empathetic fields, assume \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \).

Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{CS})) \)

Let's compute it:

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.03 + 0.18 = 0.21 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.21} = \frac{0.03}{0.21} \approx 0.143 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Assuming the same as for other fields, \( P(H_{AVS}) \approx 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s strong appreciation for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, this fits well. So, \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.6 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Same as before, estimated at \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \approx 0.2 \).

Using Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{AVS})) \]

Let's compute it:

\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.06 + 0.18 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.24} = \frac{0.06}{0.24} = 0.25 \]

### Final Probabilities

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.143,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25
}
```

These are estimates based on assumptions and available information; actual values may vary with more precise data.
