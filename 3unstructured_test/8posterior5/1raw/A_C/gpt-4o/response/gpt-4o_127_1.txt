To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, we can apply Bayes' theorem, which is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, we need to specify:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Since we don't have exact values, we can make educated guesses based on the information provided:

- \( P(H) \): We can assume that the probability of Adam being enrolled in any given field is relatively low due to the wide variety of fields. For simplicity, we might consider this to be uniformly low across fields.
- \( P(E|H) \): We need to assess how likely Adam's traits are given each field of study.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This can be considered as the complement probability and adjust accordingly.

Let's consider the plausibilities for "computer science" and "agricultural and veterinary science":

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Assuming an even distribution across fields, let's say \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): Traits like high intelligence and problem-solving suggest a higher probability: \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming given his traits, the probability is relatively lower: \( P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.1 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Similarly, let's say \( P(\text{AVS}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) \): Given his love for nature, animals, and empathy, the probability is higher: \( P(E|\text{AVS}) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming given his traits, the probability is lower: \( P(E|\neg \text{AVS}) = 0.1 \)

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses and can be factored out when comparing probabilities, we can now compute \( P(H|E) \):

Using Bayes' Theorem formula for each field:

### Computer Science
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{ P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) }{ P(E) } \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{ P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS}) }{ P(E) } \]

Now plug in the values:

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across both calculations, we can drop it for comparison:

### Relative Probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS}|E) \propto 0.03 \)
- \( P(\text{AVS}|E) \propto 0.07 \)

Now, normalize them to fit between 0 and 1:

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.07} = \frac{0.03}{0.10} = 0.3 \]
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.03 + 0.07} = \frac{0.07}{0.10} = 0.7 \]

Thus, the subjective probabilities for Adam being enrolled in each field are:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
