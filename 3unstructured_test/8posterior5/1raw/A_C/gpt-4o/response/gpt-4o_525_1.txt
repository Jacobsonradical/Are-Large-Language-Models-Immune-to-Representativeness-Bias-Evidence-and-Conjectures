To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of H given E, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of E given H, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H, and \( P(E) \) is the evidence.

Let's start by outlining the values we will estimate for each field:

### For Computer Science

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that Adam, chosen at random among all graduate students in the U.S., is in computer science. Let's say this is moderate, so we choose \( 0.10 \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of having the described personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in computer science. Given Adam’s attributes, it seems less likely but not impossible, as some in computer science might share similar traits. We'll estimate this as \( 0.10 \).
3. **Probability of evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of having the described personality sketch \( E \) among students not in computer science. This can be estimated as the complement, and I will take it as \( 0.40 \).
 
### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is lower because fewer students are in this field compared to the entirety of grad students, say \( 0.02 \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of having the described personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. This is likely high due to strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature. Let’s estimate this as \( 0.80 \).
3. **Probability of evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This would be the same as earlier for non-computer science students but perhaps slightly different specific to non-agricultural sciences, which we'll average out to \( 0.45 \).

Now let's compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}})(1 - P(H_{\text{cs}}))} \]
\[ = \frac{0.10 \times 0.10}{0.10 \times 0.10 + 0.40 \times 0.90} \]
\[ = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.36} \]
\[ = \frac{0.01}{0.37} \approx 0.027 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{\text{agvs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agvs}}) P(H_{\text{agvs}})}{P(E|H_{\text{agvs}}) P(H_{\text{agvs}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agvs}})(1 - P(H_{\text{agvs}}))} \]
\[ = \frac{0.80 \times 0.02}{0.80 \times 0.02 + 0.45 \times 0.98} \]
\[ = \frac{0.016}{0.016 + 0.441} \]
\[ = \frac{0.016}{0.457} \approx 0.035 \]

Therefore, the probabilities that Adam is in each field given his personality traits are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.035
}
```

This indicates a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary sciences relative to computer science given the outlined traits.
