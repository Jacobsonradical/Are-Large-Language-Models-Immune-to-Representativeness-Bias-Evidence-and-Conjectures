To determine the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science as a graduate student based on his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood that the personality sketch \( E \) would be observed if Adam were enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood that the personality sketch \( E \) would be observed if Adam were not enrolled in the field.

Additionally, we need to make some reasonable assumptions given the provided information. Let's assume that the following distributions for these probabilities are subjective but reasonable for this exercise.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science generally might be modest, say 0.05.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, and strong empathy, it's highly likely he fits in this field. So, let's assume 0.7.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam were not in agricultural and veterinary science, then the likelihood of this personality sketch fitting some other field might be lower due to the specific interest in nature and animals. Let's assume 0.1.

### Computer Science:
1. **P(H)**: Computer science is a relatively popular choice among graduate students. Let's suppose the prior probability is 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, he could fit in computer science, but other parts of his personality sketch (e.g., love for animals, nature) are not as consistent. Let's assume 0.3.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam were not in computer science, the likelihood of this personality sketch emerging might still be reasonable because other fields could match his attributes (e.g., biological sciences). Let's assume 0.15.

### Bayesian Update:
To find \( P(H|E) \), we need to compute

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

where \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \).

Let's summarize the computations new values for P(H|E):

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \)

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.095 = 0.13 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.7 \cdot 0.05)}{0.13} = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \approx 0.269 \]

#### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \)

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.15 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.12 = 0.18 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.3 \cdot 0.2)}{0.18} = \frac{0.06}{0.18} \approx 0.333 \]

### Conclusion:
Here are the computed probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch:
