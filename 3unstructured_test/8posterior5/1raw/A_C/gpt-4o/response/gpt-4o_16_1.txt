Let's approach the problem step-by-step using Bayes' theorem, which is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

For the sake of this problem, we can ignore the absolute value of \( P(E) \) because it is constant when comparing different hypotheses. Instead, we will focus on the relative probabilities.

### 1. Computer Science
Assessing \( P(H) \):
- The prior probability, \( P(H) \), for computer science can be considered moderate, given the popularity of this field.
- Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \), reflecting a moderate prior probability.

Assessing \( P(E|H) \):
- Computer science generally requires intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts, which matches Adam’s traits.
- However, the traits of empathy, love for nature, and animals don't strongly correlate.
- Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

Assessing \( P(E|\neg H) \):
- If Adam is not in computer science, how likely are these traits? These traits are common in many other fields.
- Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

So,

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.15 = 0.045 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Assessing \( P(H) \):
- The prior probability, \( P(H) \), for agricultural and veterinary science might be lower due to fewer students choosing this field.
- Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

Assessing \( P(E|H) \):
- This field strongly aligns with Adam’s love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
- Thus, \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

Assessing \( P(E|\neg H) \):
- If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, these traits are less likely compared to when he is in this field.
- Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

So,

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

Now, we can compute the relative probabilities:

### Normalizing
To normalize and compare:

Let:
\[ P(H | E)_1 = 0.045 \] (computer science)
\[ P(H | E)_2 = 0.04 \] (agricultural and veterinary science)

The marginal likelihood \( P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) \) + ... (other fields too, but omitted here for simplicity)

Normalizing,
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.04} = \frac{0.045}{0.085} \approx 0.529 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.045 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.085} \approx 0.471 \]

Thus, the final probabilities are approximately:

  "computer science": 0.529,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.471
