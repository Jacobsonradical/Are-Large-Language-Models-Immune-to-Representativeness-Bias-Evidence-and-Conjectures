To calculate the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch (E), we will use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both hypotheses and will drop out when comparing the two, I'll focus on \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\), recognizing that \( \neg H \) refers to all other possible fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\(P(H)\)**: The prior probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume it's a reasonably frequent field for graduate studies in the U.S. but still not the most common, so \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: Given the subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, these traits strongly correlate with this field.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The likelihood of Adam's traits if he were in any other field. Some fields may share similar traits, though it's less common.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

Putting it all together for agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Computer Science

1. **\(P(H)\)**: The prior probability that Adam is in computer science. Given the popularity of this field among graduate students, \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: Adam’s traits like problem-solving and intelligence are favorable for computer science, but his empathy and love for animals aren’t strongly correlated.
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)
3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: As before.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

Putting it all together for computer science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Using these results, the probabilities proportional to \( P(H|E) \) are:
