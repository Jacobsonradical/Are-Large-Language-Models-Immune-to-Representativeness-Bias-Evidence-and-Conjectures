To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for both computer science and agricultural and veterinary science, we'll use Bayes' Rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch.
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the probability that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Let us assign some reasonable estimates to these probabilities based on the personality sketch provided and typical characteristics of students in each field:

### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume that the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is 0.2 (20%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality sketch, it's somewhat unusual but not impossible for a computer science student to have these traits. We'll estimate this at 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in another field. Let's estimate this at 0.1, considering the specific nature of the traits aligning more with other fields.

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
To get \( P(E) \), we need to take into account the probabilities of observing the sketch across all fields, but since we are only comparing two fields here, we'll simplify this to focus on the relative probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.1 (10%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality sketch of a genuine love for nature, plants, and animals, this is highly consistent. We'll estimate this at 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood if Adam was enrolled in another field. We'll keep this at 0.1, same as above.

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity and due to lack of \( P(E) \) values, we'll compare the numerators directly:

For computer science:
\[ 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Now we normalize these probabilities:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.08} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.4286 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.06 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.14} \approx 0.5714 \]

Thus, the final probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.4286,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5714
}
