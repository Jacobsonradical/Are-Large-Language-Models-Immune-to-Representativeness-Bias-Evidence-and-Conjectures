To calculate \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch E), we can use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule can be stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, \( P(E) \) is the normalization factor which ensures the probabilities sum to 1, and we can express it as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}}) + P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + \sum_{i} P(E|H_{\text{other}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{other}}) \]

Given we do not have specific numerical values but a qualitative assessment, we'll need to make reasonable estimates.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's strong empathy, warm heart, deep love for animals, and interest in nature and its various plants, the personality sketch strongly aligns with someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align with this field. However, his personality related to empathy, love for animals, and nature interest could be less aligned with the typical profile of Computer Science students.

Let's estimate the probabilities:

### Estimations

- **P(H_{\text{ag}})**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  - Let's assume a prior probability \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) \approx 0.1 \).

- **P(H_{\text{cs}})**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in Computer Science.
  - Given the popularity of Computer Science, let's assume \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H_{\text{ag}})**: Likelihood that someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Science has Adam's personality traits.
  - Given the high alignment, let's set this \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \approx 0.8 \).

- **P(E|H_{\text{cs}})**: Likelihood that someone in Computer Science has Adam's personality traits.
  - Let's set this \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.4 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: Likelihood that someone not in these fields has Adam's personality traits. This would be an average of personalities in all other fields.
  - Let's set this \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

### Calculations

- **Denote agricultural and veterinary science as "ag":**
  \[
  P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
  \]

- **Denote computer science as "cs":**
  \[
  P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
  \]

Ignoring the normalization factor and focusing on relative scales, we have the proportionality:
- \( P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \)

Given there are other fields, we aren't normalizing to sum to 1 here:

\[
\text{Probability Estimates:}
\]

\[
\{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.4
\}
\]

These are rough estimates, as exact values of \( P(E) \) would be required for normalization.
