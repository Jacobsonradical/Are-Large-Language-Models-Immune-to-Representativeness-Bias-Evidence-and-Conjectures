To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and the question doesn't require strict normalization, we will rank the probabilities but not necessarily derive exact values.

Let's estimate the needed probabilities qualitatively:

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is studying computer science can be considered relatively high, as computer science is a popular field.
   - Estimated \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): 0.2

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality traits like high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts align well with the demands of computer science. However, his love for nature and animals does not strongly align with this field.
   - Estimated \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): 0.4

3. **P(E| \neg H)**: The probability of a random graduate student having Adam's personality traits, excluding those in computer science, is moderate since many fields value high intelligence and empathy.
   - Estimated \( P(E| \neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): 0.3

Using Bayes' Theorem (qualitatively):
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science is lower compared to computer science, but non-negligible.
   - Estimated \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): 0.1

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Estimated \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): 0.7

3. **P(E| \neg H)**: The probability of a random graduate student having Adam's traits, excluding those in agricultural and veterinary science, is moderate.
   - Estimated \( P(E| \neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): 0.3

Using Bayes' Theorem (qualitatively):
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]

### Result

Based on these estimations, the relative posterior probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07
}

These rankings suggest that, while computer science is slightly more likely given a random student, Adam's specific traits seem to fit agricultural and veterinary science quite well, making the two fields comparably plausible for him given his unique personality sketch.
