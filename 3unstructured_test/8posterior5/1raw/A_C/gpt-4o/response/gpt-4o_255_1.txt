To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field and then compute \( P(H|E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering the baseline rate of students in this field among many possible graduate programs, let's set a rough estimate:
\[ P(H) \approx 0.05 \]

**P(E|H):** The probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his genuine curiosity about nature and strong love for animals, this aligns very well with this field:
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \]

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Since there are other fields that may also align with his traits (e.g., biology, environmental science), but not all fields will match as well, let's estimate:
\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
However, since \( P(E) \) is common and not directly given, we can look at relative comparisons:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 / x = 0.04 / x \]

### Computer Science

**P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. This is a very popular field among graduate students:
\[ P(H) \approx 0.15 \]

**P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is in computer science. Given his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, this seems moderately supportive:
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \]

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in computer science. Since Adam's traits match certain non-computer science fields strongly but could also match other fields:
\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Again, using relative comparisons:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.15 / x = 0.06 / x \]

Comparing the scales for both fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.04}{x} \approx 0.4 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.06}{x} \approx 0.6 \)
}

This suggests that, given Adam's traits and the rough priors and likelihoods we've assigned, computer science is somewhat more likely than agricultural and veterinary science for Adam's field.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
