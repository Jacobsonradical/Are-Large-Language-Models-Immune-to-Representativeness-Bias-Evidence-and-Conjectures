To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we must follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) appears in the denominator for each value of \( H \) and the total does not need to add up to 1, we'll focus on calculating the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each hypothesis. This will allow us to compare the relative likelihoods.

Given our assessments, here are the individual components:

1. **P(H)**:
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Reasonably high probability because Adam shows an appreciation and curiosity for nature and animals.
     - \( P(H_ \text{agricultural}) = 0.2 \)
   - **Computer Science**: Moderate probability because Adam is described as having high intelligence and is good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant for this field.
     - \( P(H_ \text{computer}) = 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: High probability given Adam's traits match closely with an interest in this field.
     - \( P(E|H_ \text{agricultural}) = 0.9 \)
   - **Computer Science**: Moderate to high probability since analytical skills and intelligence are compatible, although not as directly aligned with his stated interests.
     - \( P(E|H_ \text{computer}) = 0.5 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's personality sketch suggests that he would also be suited to other fields related to nature, biology, and environmental sciences. Therefore, the traits are somewhat less likely to be found in non-agricultural science fields but still possible.
     - \( P(E|\neg H_ \text{agricultural}) = 0.4 \)
   - **Computer Science**: Traits can fit well in non-technical sciences and other analytically demanding domains.
     - \( P(E|\neg H_ \text{computer}) = 0.2 \)

Now, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field without considering \( P(E) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[ 
P(H_ \text{agricultural}|E) \propto P(E|H_ \text{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_ \text{agricultural}) 
= 0.9 \times 0.2 
= 0.18 
\]

2. **Computer Science**:

\[ 
P(H_ \text{computer}|E) \propto P(E|H_ \text{computer}) \cdot P(H_ \text{computer}) 
= 0.5 \times 0.1 
= 0.05 
\]

Combining these proportional values:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18,
  "computer science": 0.05
}

These values show the likelihoods updated by observed traits but do not need to sum up to 1 as weâ€™re not dividing by \( P(E) \).
