To compute \(P(H|E)\), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a certain field given his personality sketch, we follow Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of Adam's personality sketch.

Since we're comparing two fields, we'll denote these values separately for each.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: 
   Let's say, based on general graduate student enrollments, the probability of a student being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is low. Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.05\).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: 
   Given Adam's personality (a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, a warm heart, and empathy), his profile fits well within Agricultural and Veterinary Science. We assign a high likelihood, say \(P(E|H) = 0.9\).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: 
   For graduate students not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, the likelihood of having Adam's personality traits is expected to be lower. We might set \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: 
   The probability of a student being in Computer Science is generally high, so let's assume \(P(H) = 0.2\).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: 
   Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles align well with Computer Science, but his love for animals and nature might not be as fitting. We assign a moderate likelihood, say \(P(E|H) = 0.5\).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: 
   For graduate students not in Computer Science, the likelihood of having Adam's particular traits might not change drastically. We might set \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.6\).

To find \(P(H|E)\), we normalize these values using the formula. But, since we are only comparing two fields here, we can present the values directly considering the relative proportions:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.15,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These values are illustrative and relative representations of how likely Adam is to be in each field, given his personality traits. The actual computations would require normalization considering all possible fields, which isn't shown here. Nonetheless, the values indicate relative likelihoods.
