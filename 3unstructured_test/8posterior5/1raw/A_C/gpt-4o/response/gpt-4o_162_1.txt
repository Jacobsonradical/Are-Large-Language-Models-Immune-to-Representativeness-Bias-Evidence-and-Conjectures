To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the absolute value of \( P(E) \) cancels out in the normalization step, we are interested in the relative values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each hypothesis. Let's denote:

- \( H_{cs} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{ag} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

To estimate the probabilities, we can make some reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch and the general likelihood of enrolling in each field at a graduate level:

1. **_P(H_{cs})_**: The general probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science.
2. **_P(H_{ag})_**: The general probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **_P(E|H_{cs})_**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science.
4. **_P(E|H_{ag})_**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
5. **_P(E|\neg H)_**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that specific field. 

For simplicity, let's use rough estimates:

1. **General Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(H_{cs}) \): The popularity of computer science suggests a prior of around 0.3 for computer science.
   - \( P(H_{ag}) \): Agricultural and veterinary science might have a smaller pool, say around 0.1.

2. **Conditional Probabilities**:
   - \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Given the characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong appreciation for hard work) seem less aligned with typical computer science traits, I would estimate it around 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H_{ag}) \): Given his traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science, I'd estimate it at 0.7.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \): Traits like empathy, love for animals are quite common in non-CS fields, say 0.4.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{ag}) \): Likewise, traits can appear in non-agricultural fields also around 0.3.

Now calculate:

\[
P(H_{cs}|E) \propto P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03
\]

\[
P(H_{ag}|E) \propto P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07
\]

The normalization constant \( P(E) \) is the sum of the numerators:

\[
P(E) = 0.03 + 0.07 = 0.10
\]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

\[
P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.10} = 0.3
\]

\[
P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.10} = 0.7
\]

Therefore:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
