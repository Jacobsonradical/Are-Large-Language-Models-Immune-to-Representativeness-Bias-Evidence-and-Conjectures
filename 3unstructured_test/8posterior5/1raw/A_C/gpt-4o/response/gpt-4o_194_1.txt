To apply Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the probabilities involved. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam.

We need to evaluate:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch if Adam is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \): Overall probability of the personality sketch (this can be inferred from \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)).

Let's assign some reasonable probabilities based on typical characteristics of students in these fields and the information provided in the personality sketch.

For "computer science":
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability could be around 0.1 because computer science is a popular graduate field, but not as closely related to Adam's described interests.
- \( P(E|H) \): While it's not impossible, the personality sketch (deep love for animals and nature) isn't typical for computer science students, let's say 0.05.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of the personality sketch occurring if Adam is not in computer science, assuming other fields are more likely to fit these traits, let's say 0.2.

For "agricultural and veterinary science":
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability could be around 0.05 as it's a less common field, but it aligns well given Adam's interests, but still lower compared to computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood is higher because the personality sketch fits more naturally, let's assign it 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming other fields might also share some overlap but not as much, let's say 0.1.

Finally, let's assume an approximation \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

This gives us:
1. For computer science:
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.005 + 0.18 = 0.185 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.185} \approx 0.027 \]

2. For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.027,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296
}
```
