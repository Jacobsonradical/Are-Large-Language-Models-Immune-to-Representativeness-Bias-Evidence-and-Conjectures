To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in that field.

Using these, Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \)) will be the same for both hypotheses, it cancels out in the relative comparison. We can compare the two hypotheses by looking at the numerators \( P(E|H) P(H) \).

For "agricultural and veterinary science":
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability of enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science as \( 0.1 \) based on general prevalence.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy), this is quite high. Let's assume \( 0.9 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of someone with Adam's traits appearing, not in this field might still be not too low given his empathy and intelligence. Let's assume \( 0.2 \).

For "computer science":
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability of enrolling in computer science as \( 0.2 \) based on general prevalence.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's traits (love for puzzles and intelligence), this is reasonably high. Let's assume \( 0.5 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of someone with Adam's specific blend of traits appearing, not in this field might be higher. Let's assume \( 0.7 \).

Now, we calculate the numerators \( P(E|H) P(H) \) for each field:

1. For "agricultural and veterinary science":
   - \( P(E|H) P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \)

2. For "computer science":
   - \( P(E|H) P(H) = 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.10 \)

Given these calculations, we can see that, relatively speaking:
- \( P(H|E) \) for "agricultural and veterinary science" is \( \frac{0.09}{0.09+0.10} = \frac{0.09}{0.19} \approx 0.47 \)
- \( P(H|E) \) for "computer science" is \( \frac{0.10}{0.09+0.10} = \frac{0.10}{0.19} \approx 0.53 \)

Therefore, the final values for \( P(H|E) \) are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.47,
  "computer science": 0.53
}
