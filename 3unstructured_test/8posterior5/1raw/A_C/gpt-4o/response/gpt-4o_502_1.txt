To compute the posterior probability P(H|E) for each field given the personality sketch E, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that P(E) is a common denominator, we only need to consider the numerators for comparison purposes. Notably, the total does not need to add up to 1 because we are not considering all possible fields, only the given ones. 

Let’s break down the components for each field:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field. Without specific data, we assume these priors are equal.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in another field.

Given that Adam has shown traits like a love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, we will reflect how likely these traits align with each field of study:

### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: Assuming regular distribution, let’s take this as 0.5.
- **P(E|H)**: 
  - Interest in solving puzzles aligns well with computer science.
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are good fits.
  However:
  - Curiosity about nature and love for animals do not naturally align with computer science.
  
  So, P(E|H) would be moderate, let’s assign it 0.3.

- **P(E|¬H)**: While this part is more domain-agnostic, let's carefully generalize it:
  - Adam's traits are not strongly pushing towards any field specifically.
  
Thus, P(E|¬H) remains around 0.5 (more general assumption).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: Still starting from an equal baseline, take this as 0.5.
- **P(E|H)**: 
  - Strong empathy, interest in nature, and love for animals are highly aligned with this field.
  - The other traits (solving puzzles, high intelligence) do not conflict strongly.
  
  Thus, P(E|H) is high, being around 0.7.

- **P(E|¬H)**:
  Similar reflection as above:
  - Traits fit more closely to Agricultural and Veterinary, thus it's moderately aligned for those not in this field.

Given another base value of around 0.5.

Now calculate the posterior belief P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Total probability P(E) can be excluded for comparison:

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \propto P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS} = 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{AgVet} \propto P(E|H)_{AgVet} \cdot P(H)_{AgVet} = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35 \]

Thus, in proportion:
{
  "computer science": 0.15, 
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35 
}

These provide the estimations relative to observed patterns of personality and field alignment.
