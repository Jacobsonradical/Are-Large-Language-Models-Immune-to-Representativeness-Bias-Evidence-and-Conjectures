To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the given field.

Then, we compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Although \( P(E) \) (the total probability of \( E \)) is generally hard to estimate without additional data, since we're comparing fields, we can ignore the normalization factor and focus on the relative values.

### For Computer Science:

1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: A general estimate might be the proportion of graduate students in computer science. Let's assume this is relatively common, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch in computer science. Given his warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals, it's less typical but possible. I'd estimate this might be around \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality but being in any other field. Given a diverse set of possible fields, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.02 \).

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: The proportion of students in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower than in computer science. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality sketch in this field is very high since it fits well with his interest in nature and animals. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of having Adam’s personality but not being in this field will be relatively high for non-computer fields but not as high because this field is more specific. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Plugging these into Bayes’ Rule:

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx 0.02 \times \frac{1}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \approx 0.045 \times \frac{1}{P(E)} \]

Since we are interested in the relative probabilities and \( P(E) \) is constant across comparisons, we can omit it in our comparative framework and focus on the numerators:

### Relative values:
- Computer Science: \( 0.02 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.045 \)

So, normalizing these numerically to add up to relative differences we have:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045
}
```

These values suggest that Adam is more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science given his personality sketch.
