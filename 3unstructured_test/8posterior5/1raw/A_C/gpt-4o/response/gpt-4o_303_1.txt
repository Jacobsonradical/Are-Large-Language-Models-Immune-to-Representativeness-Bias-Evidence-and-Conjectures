To solve this using Bayes' Theorem, we need to consider the following probabilities for each field, represented as H:

1. **P(H): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field H.**
2. **P(E|H): Likelihood of observing the evidence E (personality sketch) given H.**
3. **P(E|\neg H): Likelihood of observing the evidence E given any field other than H.**

Using these, we can compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We'll consider "computer science" and "agricultural and veterinary science". Let's denote:
- **H1**: Adam being in "computer science".
- **H2**: Adam being in "agricultural and veterinary science".

We need to estimate each of these for both fields:

### Computer Science

**Prior (P(H1)):**
Let's assume that computer science is a relatively popular field. For the sake of estimation, let's assign \( P(H1) \) a prior of 0.4.

**Likelihood (P(E|H1)):**
Given the personality sketch:
- Curiosity about nature and plants (less common in computer science)
- Enjoys solving puzzles (common in computer science)
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals (less relevant to computer science)
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts (common in computer science)
- Appreciation for hard work (relevant for any field)

Out of 5 traits, 2 distinctly align with computer science. So, let's estimate \( P(E|H1) \) as 0.4.

**Likelihood given not H1 (P(E|\neg H1)):**
Considering other fields (including agricultural and veterinary science, humanities, etc.):
Let's assume that the sketch would be moderately likely for other fields. Let’s assign it 0.2.

P(E):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \cdot P(\neg H1) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.4 + 0.2 \cdot 0.6 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.16 + 0.12 = 0.28 \]

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.4}{0.28} \approx 0.57 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Prior (P(H2)):**
Let's assume a smaller prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science due to fewer students enrolling in this field compared to computer science. Assign \( P(H2) \) a prior of 0.1.

**Likelihood (P(E|H2)):**
Given the personality sketch:
- Curiosity about nature and plants (highly relevant)
- Enjoys solving puzzles (possibly relevant)
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals (highly relevant)
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts (relevant)
- Appreciation for hard work (relevant for any field)

Out of 5 traits, 4 distinctly align with agricultural and veterinary science. So, let's estimate \( P(E|H2) \) as 0.8.

**Likelihood given not H2 (P(E|\neg H2)):**
This would be the average of other fields excluding agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assign it 0.3.

P(E):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E| \neg H2) \cdot P( \neg H2 ) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \approx 0.23 \]

### Final Answer
{
  "computer science": 0.57,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.23
}
