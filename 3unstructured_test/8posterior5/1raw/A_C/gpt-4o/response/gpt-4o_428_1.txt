To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence against the hypotheses \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can simplify our comparisons by computing them on a relative basis because we are comparing two hypotheses.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H):** Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and his warm heart, it is reasonable to think that he could be studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assign this a moderate probability. Assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

**P(E|H):** If Adam were indeed studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science, then his personality traits would align very well with that field. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) should be high, so let's set \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).

**P(E|\neg H):** For fields other than Agricultural and Veterinary Science, his personality traits might not align as well, so let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

### Computer Science

**P(H):** Given Adam's intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, it is also reasonable to think that he could be studying Computer Science. Again, let's assign this a moderate probability. Assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

**P(E|H):** If Adam were studying Computer Science, some traits (such as interest in puzzles and high intelligence) align well, but others (like love for animals and empathy) might not be directly related. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \).

**P(E|\neg H):** For non-Computer Science fields, given the diverse nature of Adam's traits, the probabilities could vary greatly, so assign \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

### Bayes' Rule Calculation

Let's assume that \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields for comparison purposes.

Now, applying Bayes' rule for each field:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.08 / P(E) \]

#### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = 0.04 / P(E) \]

By comparing the relative probabilities, we can see that:

\[ \frac{P(H|E)_{agri}}{P(H|E)_{cs}} = \frac{0.08/P(E)}{0.04/P(E)} = 2 \]

Therefore, Adam is twice as likely to be studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science than Computer Science, given the provided traits.
