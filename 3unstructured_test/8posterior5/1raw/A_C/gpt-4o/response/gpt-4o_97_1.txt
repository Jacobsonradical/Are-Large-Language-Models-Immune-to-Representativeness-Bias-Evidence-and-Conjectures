To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to assess the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Let's start by setting some reasonable estimates for these probabilities.

**Step-by-step computation for each field:**

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, it's quite likely he would be in this field. Let's assume:
   \[
   P(H) = 0.2
   \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   This field aligns well with the personality sketch:
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.9
   \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   For now, let's assume the likelihood of having such a personality in any other random field is moderate:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.3
   \]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Given Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence, he might be considered less likely but still not negligible in computer science:
   \[
   P(H) = 0.1
   \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Some aspects of computer science match Adam's traits, like problem-solving and abstract thinking:
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.5
   \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   Let's again assume the likelihood of having such a personality in any other random field:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.3
   \]

### Computing \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem states:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[
P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.18 + 0.24 = 0.42
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} = \frac{0.18}{0.42} = 0.4286
\]

#### For Computer Science

\[
P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.05 + 0.27 = 0.32
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.32} = \frac{0.05}{0.32} = 0.1563
\]

Thus, combining these results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4286,
  "computer science": 0.1563
}
```
