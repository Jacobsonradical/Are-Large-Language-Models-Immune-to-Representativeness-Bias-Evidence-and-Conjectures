To compute \(P(H|E)\), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \(E\), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is constant for both fields, we can compare the values \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\). Additionally, we'll estimate \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) based on the given information.

### Computer Science:
1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Let's assume the distribution of graduate students and set \(P(H) = 0.3\) (representing a moderate chance).
2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in computer science. Adam's traits such as high intelligence and abstract thinking align well with computer science, but his love for nature, animals, and empathy might make this less likely. Assume \(P(E|H) = 0.4\).
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in computer science. Assume this to be fairly independent: \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.5\).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his deep love for plants and animals, let's assume \(P(H) = 0.2\) (a relatively focused specialty).
2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. His personality traits align strongly with this field. Assume \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).
3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Assume it to be less likely outside this field: \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

Only the proportional part is necessary for these fields comparison. We ignore the denominator as it's constant for both fields.

### Calculations:
- **Computer Science:**

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

### Normalization:

Comparing the proportional results:
- Computer Science: 0.12
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.16

The normalized probabilities would be:

- Computer Science: \(\frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.16} \approx 0.429\)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \(\frac{0.16}{0.12 + 0.16} \approx 0.571\)

Thus, given Adam's personality sketch, the most probable field he was enrolled in was Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
