Sure, I can help you compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, we need to make some assumptions regarding \( P(H), P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) to proceed with the calculations. Since these probabilities can be subjective and based on your understanding or relevant data, I'll provide reasonable assumptions and compute the posterior probabilities accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field is an initial estimate (prior probability). Since there are many graduate fields and we are only considering two, we might assume \( P(H) \) to be relatively small.

   For simplicity, let's assume:
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.05 \)
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.10 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's personality traits, we can estimate how well they fit each field:
     - For agricultural and veterinary science: Adam’s love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work fit well.
     - For computer science: His intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts fit well.
   
   We can assume:
   - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.6 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's traits if he is *not* in the specified field. This needs to consider all other possible fields Adam might be in.
   
   Given that the traits could fit well (but not perfectly) in various other fields, we could assume:
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.4 \)

4. **Normalization Factor \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is generally the sum of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for all hypotheses plus \( P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).
   
   Instead of computing this exactly for all possible fields, we'll use the estimates to approximate the posterior directly.

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

Using these values:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)}
\]
Given:
\[
P(E) \approx P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science})
\]
\[
P(E) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325
\]
So:
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \approx 0.123
\]

#### Computer Science:
\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)}
\]
Given:
\[
P(E) \approx P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{computer science})
\]
\[
P(E) \approx 0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.06 + 0.36 = 0.42
\]
So:
\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.42} = \frac{0.06}{0.42} \approx 0.143
\]

### Final Results:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123,
  "computer science": 0.143
}
```

These results suggest that given Adam’s personality sketch, there is a slightly higher probability that he is enrolled in computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary science. However, both fields seem plausible given his traits.
