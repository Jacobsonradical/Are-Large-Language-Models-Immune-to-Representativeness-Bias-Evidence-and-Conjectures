To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch (E) of Adam, we'll follow Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Assigning Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
    \[
    \begin{align*}
    P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) & : 0.05 \\
    P(\text{computer science}) & : 0.4
    \end{align*}
    \]
    These priors are based on general statistics about the distribution of graduate students across different fields.

2. **Determining Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
    \[
    \begin{align*}
    P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) & : 0.6 \\
    P(E|\text{computer science}) & : 0.1
    \end{align*}
    \]
    These likelihoods represent how well Adam's personality sketch matches the typical profile of graduate students in these fields.

3. **Determining \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
    \[
    \begin{align*}
    P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) & : 0.05 \\
    P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) & : 0.15
    \end{align*}
    \]
    These represent how well Adam's personality sketch matches the profile of students in other fields.

4. **Calculating the Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \)** using Bayes' rule:
    \[
    \begin{align*}
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
    \end{align*}
    \]

Let's assume \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant and not compute it here since we need only relative values and the comparison between fields is our objective.

By plugging in the values:

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) & = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \\
& = \frac{0.6 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \\
& = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \\

P(\text{computer science}|E) & = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \\
& = \frac{0.1 \times 0.4}{P(E)} \\
& = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \\
\end{aligned}
\]

Therefore, the unnormalized posterior probabilities could be compared:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \frac{0.03}{P(E)},
  "computer science": \frac{0.04}{P(E)}
}
\]

When \( P(E) \) is the same for both, we can see the relative likelihood:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.03,
  "computer science": 0.04
}
\]

Taking these values into a normalized form (since we only care about relative comparison), we can use:
1. \( 0.03 + 0.04 = 0.07 \) 
2. Normalized probability for each field:
    \[
    \begin{align*}
    P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) & = \frac{0.03}{0.07} \approx 0.4286 \\
    P(\text{computer science}|E) & = \frac{0.04}{0.07} \approx 0.5714 \\
    \end{align*}
    \]

Thus, the conditional probabilities are:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4286,
  "computer science": 0.5714
}
\]
