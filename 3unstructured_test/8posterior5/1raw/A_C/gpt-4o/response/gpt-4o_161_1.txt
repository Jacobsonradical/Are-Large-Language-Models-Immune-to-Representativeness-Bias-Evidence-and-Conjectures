To answer the question, we will first assess the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each of the given fields, and then calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Theorem. We'll evaluate the fields of "agricultural and veterinary science" and "computer science," respectively.

### Definitions:

- \( P(H) \) : Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) : Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given he is in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) : Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given he is in a field other than the current hypothesis.
- \( P(H|E) \) : Posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specific field given his personality sketch \( E \).

### Process:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

1. **\( P(H) \):** Let's assume an average prior probability that any given student is in agricultural and veterinary science, say around 5%.
2. **\( P(E|H) \):** Given Adam's characteristics (love for nature, plants, animals, empathy), it is highly probable (\( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)) that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** Given that there are many fields of study and not all align as closely with Adam's traits, let's assume a lower probability, say 0.2.

**Computer Science**

1. **\( P(H) \):** Let's assume an average prior probability that any given student is in computer science, say around 10%.
2. **\( P(E|H) \):** Given Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, let's assume a moderate probability (\( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \)) that he would be enrolled in computer science.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \):** Given that there are many fields of study and some could share similar characteristics, let's assume a moderate probability, say 0.3.

### Calculation with Bayes' Theorem:

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be derived as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

Since \( \neg H \) includes all other fields, we approximate it as:

\[ P(\neg H) \approx 1 - P(H) \]

Proceeding with the calculations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 \)

   \[
   P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.174
   \]

2. **Computer Science**

   - \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)
   - \( P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.9 \)

   \[
   P(E) = 0.5 \times 0.10 + 0.3 \times 0.9 = 0.05 + 0.27 = 0.32
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.10}{0.32} \approx 0.156
   \]
