To calculate \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field, given his personality sketch), we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality characteristics if he were in that field.
- \( P(E| \neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality characteristics if he were not in that field.

We do not have sufficient statistics, so we will approach this with reasonable assumptions.

### For Computer Science:
- **P(H)** (prior probability for computer science): Let's assume about 1 in 5 graduate students are in computer science, so \( P(H) \approx 0.20 \).
- **P(E|H)** (likelihood of Adam's traits if he is in computer science): Given his intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and appreciation for hard work, computer science field is quite plausible, though it lacks natural aspects. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)** (likelihood of Adam's traits if he is not in computer science): A graduate student not in computer science but sharing these traits can occur in other fields too. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \).

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)** (prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science): Let's assume about 1 in 20 graduate students are in this field, so \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H)** (likelihood of Adam's traits if he is in agricultural and veterinary science): Given his strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature, this field aligns very well with his traits. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)** (likelihood of Adam's traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science): Similar traits may be present in other sciences as well, though less emphasized. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

Now let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) for both fields using Bayes' rule.

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

To normalize these, we can compute a proportional value such that their sum is treated relative:

### Proportional Calculation:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.04} = \frac{0.06}{0.10} = 0.6 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{AVS}} = \frac{0.04}{0.06 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.10} = 0.4 \]

This yields the relative posterior probabilities:
