Let's go through the steps systematically for both "computer science" and "agricultural and veterinary science" fields.

First, let's make reasonable prior estimations (P(H)) for each field Adam might be in, knowing he is a graduate student in the U.S. These are rough estimates.

- P(H_computer_science) = 0.2
- P(H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science) = 0.05

Next, let’s estimate P(E|H) — the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in each specific field.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Given that Adam is curious and intelligent, he might fit the profile of someone in computer science. However, a strong connection to nature and animals is less typical.
   - P(E|H_computer_science) ≈ 0.2

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - The description fits quite well with someone in this field. High empathy, a love for animals, and a curiosity about nature are core to this field.
   - P(E|H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science) ≈ 0.8

Then, estimate P(E|\neg H) — the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in the specific field.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - It’s somewhat likely that a student in another field could have this profile, especially in life sciences or environmental studies.
   - P(E|\neg H_computer_science) ≈ 0.6

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - This personality sketch is less common outside of relevant fields, but some characteristics may still intersect with fields like environmental science.
   - P(E|\neg H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science) ≈ 0.4

Using Bayes' rule, we calculate P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have P(E) directly, we use the proportional relation:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

1. **Computer Science:**

\[ P(H_computer_science|E) \propto P(E|H_computer_science) \cdot P(H_computer_science) \]
\[ P(H_computer_science|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science|E) \propto P(E|H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science) \cdot P(H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science) \]
\[ P(H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

Finally, normalizing so the total doesn't have to be exactly 1 but gives us a direct comparison:

{
  "computer science": "0.04",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.04"
}

Given the above estimates, both fields turn out to have the same computed posterior probability of fitting Adam's personality sketch. 

Keep in mind these values are rough estimations and involve subjective judgment. For more accurate values, more precise data would be needed.
