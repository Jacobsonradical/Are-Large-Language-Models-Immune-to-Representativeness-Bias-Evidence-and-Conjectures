To calculate the probabilities using Bayes' Rule \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), we'll need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the normalizing constant \( P(E) \).

Given:
- \( E \): Personality sketch of Adam.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Hypothesis \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Prior probability \( P(H_1) \): This can be estimated based on the proportion of graduate students in the U.S. studying agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it's around 5%.
     \[
     P(H_1) = 0.05
     \]
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_1) \): Given Adam's love of nature, plants, animals, and strong empathy, it fits nicely with agricultural and veterinary science.
     \[
     P(E|H_1) = 0.8
     \]
   - \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): Considering that his traits can be relevant to various other fields but perhaps not as strongly as to agricultural science, we can estimate \( P(E|\neg H_1) \) as 0.1.
     \[
     P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.1
     \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Hypothesis \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - Prior probability \( P(H_2) \): Given the high enrollment in computer science, let's assume it's around 20%.
     \[
     P(H_2) = 0.2
     \]
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_2) \): The traits such as high intelligence and problem-solving abilities are relevant to computer science, but strong empathy and love for nature and animals are less directly relevant. Estimate it moderately.
     \[
     P(E|H_2) = 0.4
     \]
   - \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): Similar to the above estimation.
     \[
     P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.1
     \]

To use Bayes' Rule, we also need to normalize the probabilities. The total probability \( P(E) \) can be complex to calculate accurately without additional context but is often estimated in scenarios like this by summing the relevant parts. For simplicity, assume:

\[
P(E) \approx P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
\]
\[
P(E) \approx (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.4 \times 0.2) = 0.04 + 0.08 = 0.12
\]

Now, apply Bayes' Rule:

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  \[
  P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.12} = \frac{0.04}{0.12} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33
  \]

- For computer science:
  \[
  P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.12} = \frac{0.08}{0.12} \approx 0.67
  \]

Thus, the computed posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.33,
  "computer science": 0.67
}
```

These values indicate the probability of Adam being enrolled in each respective field given his personality sketch.
