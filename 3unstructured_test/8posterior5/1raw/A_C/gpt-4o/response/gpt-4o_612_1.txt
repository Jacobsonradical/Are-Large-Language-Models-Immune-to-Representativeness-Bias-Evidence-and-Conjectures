To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of computer science and agricultural and veterinary science considering Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we can utilize Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is stated as follows:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the hypothesis field given the personality sketch.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in the specific field.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

### 1. Computer Science
Based on the sketch, Adam has a strong understanding of abstract concepts and is of high intelligence, which are advantageous traits for computer science. However, his deep love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work might not be specifically aligned with the common attributes seen in computer science students.

- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability of a general graduate student being enrolled in computer science. Let's assume this to be 0.2 (20%) based on general statistics of enrollment in various fields.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is a computer science student. Considering the mixed alignment, let's estimate this as 0.3 (30%).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality if he is not in computer science. Given that the traits match better with other fields, let's assume this to be higher, around 0.5 (50%).

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Adamâ€™s love for nature, empathy, and animals align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences. 

- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The prior probability of a general graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a smaller prior, say 0.1 (10%).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality if he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the strong alignment, let's estimate this as 0.8 (80%).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This might be around 0.4 (40%) as the traits could still somewhat fit other fields.

\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
\]

We should recalculate \( P(E) \) as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}})
\]

Since calculating the exact \( P(E) \) would require details of all possible fields, we'll assume a rough estimate based on the given probabilities.

\[
P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})
\]
\[
P(E) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14
\]

Now we can compute the normalized posterior probabilities:

### Computer Science
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.14} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.4286
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.14} = \frac{0.08}{0.14} \approx 0.5714
\]

So, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4286,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5714
}
```
