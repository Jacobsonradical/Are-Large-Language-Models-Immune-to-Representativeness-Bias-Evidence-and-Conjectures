To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field of study (P(H|E)), we need to apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since P(E) remains constant across the different fields and we are comparing relative probabilities, we can omit P(E) for this comparison and focus on the numerators:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Assessing the Hypotheses:

**1. Computer Science:**
- **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was studying computer science in general.
Assuming a rough estimate, since computer science is a common field, we might place P(H) at around 0.2.

- **P(E|H)**: Probability of observing E (Adam's personality) given H (study in computer science).
Given that computer scientists can have varying personalities, someone like Adam who enjoys solving puzzles would fit well, but his strong empathy and deep love for animals might make him less typical. Let’s estimate it at around 0.4.

- **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of observing E given Adam is studying a different field.
This remains broad, but considering Adam’s personality traits might align better with other fields such as biology or environmental sciences, this might be set at around 0.6.

**2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science in general. Considering this field is less common but still important, placing P(H) around 0.1 seems reasonable.

- **P(E|H)**: Probability of observing E given H.
This is a strong match given Adam’s curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals. Let’s place it at around 0.8.

- **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of observing E given a different study field.
Given Adam’s traits, this could be moderate, especially since other fields might not align as perfectly as agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s set this at around 0.5.

### Calculating the Relative Probabilities:

**Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Normalizing (relative comparison shows equal probability):
Since the probabilities for both fields turned out to be the same, they both get roughly equal chances:

{
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}

Given these relative values, without further specific probabilities and for this comparison, it turns out Adam's alignment with each field is equally weighted based on the formulated hypotheses and their probabilities. However, it's essential to remember that this is a simplification and further information could shift these estimations.
