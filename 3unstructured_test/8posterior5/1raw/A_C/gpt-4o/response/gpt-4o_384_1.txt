To evaluate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "computer science", we will apply Bayes' theorem, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): The initial probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
3. **Marginal Likelihood** \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch across all fields, which serves as a normalizing constant.

4. **Complement Likelihood** \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field. 

Considering:

1. Agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work.
2. Computer science aligns well with Adam's love for solving puzzles and high intelligence but less so with his curiosity about nature and love for animals.

Prior Probability \( P(H) \):

- \( P(\text{Agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.1 \): Assuming roughly 10% of all graduate students might be in this field.
- \( P(\text{Computer science}) \approx 0.2 \): Assuming roughly 20% of all graduate students might be in this field.

Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):

- \( P(E|\text{Agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.9 \): Adam's traits fit very well with this field.
- \( P(E|\text{Computer science}) \approx 0.5 \): Some traits align but not as strongly.

Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):

- Given that \(\neg H\) encompasses all other possible fields and considering the broadness of Adam's traits, a reasonable estimate for the complement likelihood would be:
  - \( P(E|\neg \text{Agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.3 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg \text{Computer science}) \approx 0.7 \)

Next, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and considering we're only dealing with these fields, we can use the approximated values:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.2} = \frac{0.09}{0.19} \approx 0.474 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.2} = \frac{0.1}{0.19} \approx 0.526 \)
}

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.474",
  "computer science": "0.526"
}
