To apply Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's break it down field-by-field based on the personality sketch provided:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **Prior Probability** \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Computer Science is a fairly common field for graduate students in the U.S. Let's assume a reasonable prior probability of \( 0.3 \) (30%).
   - **Likelihood** \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Adam's personality traits such as high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, his interest in nature and a deep love for animals isn't strongly indicative of a typical computer science student. Let's assume a moderate likelihood of \( 0.2 \) (20%).
   - **Evidence under Complement** \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): This reflects how likely Adam's traits would be seen in students not studying computer science. Given his traits seem more aligned with another field like agricultural and veterinary science, this should be relatively high. Let's assume \( 0.5 \) (50%).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **Prior Probability** \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): This is a less common field compared to computer science. Let's assume a lower prior probability of \( 0.1 \) (10%).
   - **Likelihood** \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication fit well in this field. Let's assume a high likelihood of \( 0.8 \) (80%).
   - **Evidence under Complement** \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Given his personality traits align strongly with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, it's less expected he fits into another field. Let's assume \( 0.4 \) (40%).

Now let's compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and not explicitly required for ranking, we can focus on the numerator for comparing the two hypotheses.

**Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Given these proportional results, we normalize (though not required here as asked for probabilities) but keeping in mind relative magnitudes confirm:

{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}

This indicates it's more likely Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on the given personality sketch.
