To compute \( P(H|E) \), we can use Bayes' Rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to assess the probabilities for each field, which are as follows:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the evidence if Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing the evidence if Adam is not enrolled in a specific field.

Since \( P(E) \) can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

However, for simplicity, we will not compute the exact value of \( P(E) \), because doing a comparative evaluation using Bayes' rule’s ratio usually suffices for such problems.

### 1. Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being a computer science graduate student. Given how common Computer Science programs are, let's guess around 0.2 (a fairly high proportion but not dominant among all possible fields).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch if he is a Computer Science student. Computer Science typically attracts analytical and intelligent individuals, some of whom may have an appreciation for nature and animals, but it's less specifically aligned than some other fields. Let's estimate 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he is not a Computer Science student. Assuming a broad field of other studies, many other fields might also be consistent with this sketch. Let's guess 0.1.

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): This field is more specialized. Let's estimate the prior probability to be lower, say around 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he is an Agricultural and Veterinary Science student is likely higher because of his strong love for nature and animals. Let's estimate it at 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This stays similar to other assessments, let's guess 0.1.

Let's assume \( P(E) \) (the evidential probability) will normalize our total probabilities to 1.

Now, calculate comparative \( P(H|E) \) for both fields without separately assessing \( P(E) \):

1. For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{(0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.1 \times 0.8)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.08} \]
\[ = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \]
\[ = 0.4286 \]

2. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{(0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.095} \]
\[ = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \]
\[ = 0.2963 \]

These results give us approximate probabilities. Here's the final format as requested:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4286,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2963
}
```

Please note that in a full Bayesian approach, these probabilities may need further adjustment for the overall sum and other fields that could better fit Adam’s profile.
