To compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need these components:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in the specific field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in the specific field.
4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the evidence irrespective of the field.

Given the personality sketch (E), let's evaluate:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let’s assume it’s a fairly common field for someone with his interests so let's set it at 0.15.
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s love for nature, animals, and plants, plus his empathy and hardworking nature, this field strongly matches his personality sketch. Let’s assign a high probability, like 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence given Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This is trickier, but let's make an educated guess considering other fields; set it at 0.2 because these traits could fit less well but still somewhat fit other fields.

Now use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = [P(E|H) \cdot P(H)] + [P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)] \), where \( P(\neg H) \) is the complement probability:

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.41 \]

### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Given the sheer number of students in such programs, let's assume it's reasonably common and set it at 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam’s intelligence and love of puzzles fit well with computer science, but the other aspects (love for nature, empathy for animals) fit less directly. Let’s assign a moderate probability of 0.4.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The same as above, 0.2 for reasons stated.
  
Now use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(E) = [P(E|H) \cdot P(H)] + [P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)] \]

\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.16 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.24} \approx 0.33 \]

Thus, the answers are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.41,
  "computer science": 0.33
}
