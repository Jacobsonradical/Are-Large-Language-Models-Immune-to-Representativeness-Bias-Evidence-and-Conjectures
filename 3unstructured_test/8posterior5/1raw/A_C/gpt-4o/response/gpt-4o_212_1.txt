To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study using Bayes' rule, we will need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was enrolled in that particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was not enrolled in that particular field.
4. \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing Adam's personality traits.

Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a constant factor for both hypotheses, it will cancel out when comparing the probabilities for the two fields, allowing us to focus on relative comparisons.

Let's start by estimating the probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This might be quite low compared to all possible fields of study, so let's estimate it as 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): Considering Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, these traits strongly align with this field. Let's estimate it as 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): These traits are less specific to agricultural and veterinary science but quite general and might appear in other fields as well. Let's estimate it as 0.3.

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Let's estimate it as more common, so 0.15.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's high intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving enjoyment, these traits moderately align with computer science. Let's estimate it as 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): These traits are relatively common even outside computer science, so let's keep it consistent with the above and estimate it as 0.3.

Now we will use these probabilities to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant and only the numerator changes, we can ignore it for relative comparison.

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

For **computer science**:
\[ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.15 = 0.06 \]

Given these simplified proportions, the results become relative to their sum to maintain consistency, but to respond to the format requested:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.06
}
```

This simplified analysis suggests that Adam, given his traits, is more likely to be in computer science than in agricultural and veterinary science.
