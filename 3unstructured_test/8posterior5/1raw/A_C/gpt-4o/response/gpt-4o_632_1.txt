Given the personality sketch of Adam and the fields of "computer science" and "agricultural and veterinary science," let's evaluate the probabilities step-by-step.

### Evaluations:

#### For Computer Science:

- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) is the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Considering that computer science is a popular field in the U.S., we can assign a modest prior probability. Let's say \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \) (30% as a rough baseline).

- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The likelihood of the given personality sketch if Adam is studying computer science. Adam’s personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) aren’t typically associated with computer science, although intelligence and abstract thinking certainly align. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \) (20%).

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The likelihood of the given personality sketch for a student not studying computer science. This includes a broader range of fields where Adam’s traits might be more common. Given the sketch, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \) (60%).

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): The prior probability \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \) is the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common than computer science, so let's assign a lower prior probability. Let’s say \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.1 \) (10%).

- \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): The likelihood of the given personality sketch if Adam is studying agricultural and veterinary science. The traits listed (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) strongly align with this field. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.8 \) (80%).

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): The likelihood of the given personality sketch for a student not studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given the distribution of traits, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.5 \) (50%).

### Calculations:

Using Bayes' rule \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \, P(H)}{P(E)} \):

1. For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \, P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

2. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \, P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

To solve for \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \, P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \, P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \times 0.3 + 0.6 \times 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.42 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.48 \]

Now, plugging \( P(E) \) back in:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.125 \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \, P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \, P(\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.5 \times 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.53 \]

Now, plugging \( P(E) \) back in:

\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.53} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \approx 0.151 \]

### Results:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.125,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.151
}
```

Note: These probabilities are illustrative and based on hypothetical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Actual values would require specific data.
