Let's calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the two fields: agricultural and veterinary science, and computer science.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Calculating \( P(E) \) could be complex as it requires summing over all possible fields of study. However, for this task, I will estimate the key probabilities and use them to infer the relative likelihoods. 

**Assumptions and estimations:**

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \):** This is the general probability that a random graduate student is in a particular field.
    - For agricultural and veterinary science: Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5% of students).
    - For computer science: Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of students).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** This is the probability that a student in a given field has Adam's characteristics.
    - For agricultural and veterinary science: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, a strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work, we can estimate this probability to be high, say \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
    - For computer science: Given Adam's high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, but having less direct connection with nature and animals, we can estimate this probability to be moderate, say \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):** This is the probability that a student not in a given field has Adam's characteristics. 
    - For agricultural and veterinary science: This might be lower since his traits are more aligned with the field, so let \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).
    - For computer science: This might be higher than for agricultural and veterinary science but still not too high since his traits are more unique, let \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

For simplicity, we can use the law of total probability to say that \( P(E) \) is the combination of all hypotheses.

Let's now calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using these assumptions.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

**Computer Science:** 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.15 = 0.06 \]

Now we rescale these proportions to fall between 0 and 1.

\[
\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.06} = \frac{0.035}{0.095} \approx 0.368
\]

\[
\text{Computer Science} = \frac{0.06}{0.035 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.095} \approx 0.632
\]

Hence the posterior probabilities, given the assumptions and estimations, are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.368,
  "computer science": 0.632
}
