To start, let's use Bayes' Rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

We need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam was not in that field.

### 1. Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Assume that the prior probability of Adam being in computer science is 5% (0.05), given the vast number of fields of study.
- **P(E|H)**: The evidence E is moderately fit given H because computer science does involve abstract thinking and solving puzzles, but doesn't strongly align with curiosity about nature, plants, and animals. Assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits if he were not in computer science would be high since E doesn't strongly fit computer science. Let's estimate it around 0.7.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.05}{0.3 \cdot 0.05 + 0.7 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.665} = \frac{0.015}{0.68} \approx 0.022 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Assume the prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science is 5% (0.05).
- **P(E|H)**: The evidence E strongly fits H because of his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work in those fields. Assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having these personality traits when not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is lower. Let's estimate it around 0.3.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.285} = \frac{0.04}{0.325} \approx 0.123 \]

Summarizing these results, we have:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.022,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123
}
