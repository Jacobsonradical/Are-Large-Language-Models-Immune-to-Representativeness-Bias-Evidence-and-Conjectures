To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science or agricultural and veterinary science based on the given personality sketch (E), we need to use Bayes' rule. 

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field (\( H \)).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone enrolled in the field (\( H \)).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not enrolled in the field (\(\neg H\)).
4. \( P(E) \): The marginal probability of Adam's personality sketch, but in practice, we often only need to compare relative values of \( P(H|E) \), so we can ignore this constant denominator.

### Computer Science
Based on the personality sketch:
- **Interest in nature and plants**: This is less relevant to a computer science student.
- **Love for animals**: Also less relevant.
- **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Highly relevant to computer science.
- **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: Strong indicators for computer science.

Given these, let's estimate:
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): Assume a prior of 0.2
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): Let's set a rough estimate of 0.5, as some traits do match.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \): Assume the likelihood could be around 0.2.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Based on the personality sketch:
- **Interest in nature and plants**: Very relevant.
- **Love for animals**: Very relevant.
- **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Some relevance but not as strong.
- **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: Relevant to some extent.

Given these, let's estimate:
- \( P(H_{\text{ags}}) \): Assume a prior of 0.1
- \( P(E|H_{\text{ags}}) \): Let's set a rough estimate of 0.8, as many traits match.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ags}}) \): Assume the likelihood could be around 0.2.

Now let's use these estimates to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \]
Ignoring \( P(E) \), which is a constant across comparisons,
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{ags}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ags}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ags}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{ags}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{ags}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ags}}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

The approximate normalized values are:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1+0.08} = \frac{0.1}{0.18} \approx 0.556 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{ags}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.1+0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.18} \approx 0.444 \]
