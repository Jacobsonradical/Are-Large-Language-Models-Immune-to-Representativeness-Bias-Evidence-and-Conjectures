To compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since exact probabilities are not provided and we can only make subjective estimates based on Adam's personality sketch \(E\), we assume:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a graduate student is in a particular field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in that field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is **not** in that field.

Let's evaluate this for both fields, keeping in mind his traits and interests.

### Computer Science
1. **\(P(H)\)**: Assuming computer science is a popular graduate field, we might estimate this probability moderately, say 0.15.
2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: Adam's kindness and empathy, while related skills could indirectly benefit programming but aren't typical traits solely for computer science students, we might set this lower, say 0.05.
3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Since these personality traits are perhaps rarer in a broader population of students, we can set this around 0.1.

Using these values, we can compute \(P(H|E)\):
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}
\]

We approximate \(P(E)\) as follows:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) = 0.05 \cdot 0.15 + 0.1 \cdot 0.85
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.0075 + 0.085 = 0.0925
\]

So:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.0925} \approx 0.081
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **\(P(H)\)**: Fewer students are likely in this field compared to computer science, estimate 0.05.
2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: His love for animals and nature fits very well, so we set this higher, say 0.8.
3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Broad population less likely to share all traits aligning with agricultural science, so also 0.1.

Using these values, we compute \(P(H|E)\):
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
\]

We approximate \(P(E)\) as follows:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135
\]

So:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.135} \approx 0.296
\]

Putting it all together:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.081,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296
}
