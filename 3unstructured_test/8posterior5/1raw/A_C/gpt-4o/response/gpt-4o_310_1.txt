To apply Bayes' rule and compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or computer science, we need estimates for the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field without knowing his personality sketch.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that particular field.
4. \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, which can be computed as a weighted sum of \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

For simplicity, let's assume some rough estimations:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **\( P(H) \) (agricultural and veterinary science)**:
   \[
   P(H) \approx 0.05 \text{ (estimated probability that a random student is in this field)}
   \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field)**:
   \[
   P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \text{ (high due to his interest in nature, plants, and animals)}
   \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in this field)**:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.05 \text{ (this personality sketch is not as common among all students)}
   \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Plugging in the numbers, we get:
\[
P(E) = 0.6 \times 0.05 + 0.05 \times 0.95 = 0.03 + 0.0475 = 0.0775
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.05}{0.0775} \approx 0.3871
\]

### Computer Science:

1. **\( P(H) \) (computer science)**:
   \[
   P(H) \approx 0.15 \text{ (estimated probability that a random student is in this field)}
   \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in this field)**:
   \[
   P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \text{ (some fit due to high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, but less focus on nature)}
   \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in this field)**:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.05
   \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(E) = 0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.05 \times 0.85 = 0.045 + 0.0425 = 0.0875
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{0.0875} \approx 0.5143
\]

Hence, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3871,
  "computer science": 0.5143
}
```
