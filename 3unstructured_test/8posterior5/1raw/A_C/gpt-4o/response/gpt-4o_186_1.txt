To use Bayes' Rule, we need to first estimate the following probabilities for each field:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. P(E|H): The probability of the evidence given that Adam is in that field.
3. P(E|¬H): The probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in that field.

Bayes' Rule for computing the posterior probability P(H|E) is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) (the normalizing constant) is the same for both fields and depends on all possible fields, we'll only focus on the numerator for comparisons.

Let's make the following qualitative estimates based on the personality sketch:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. P(H): The prior probability.
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science is fairly specialized but is a logical field given Adam's interest in plants and animals.
   - Estimate: 0.05

2. P(E|H): The likelihood of the evidence given this field.
   - His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are highly consistent with this field.
   - Estimate: 0.8

3. P(E|¬H): The likelihood of the evidence given not this field.
   - While the traits are generally positive and may be found in other fields, the combination of them is less likely outside of this specialization.
   - Estimate: 0.3

### Computer Science

1. P(H): The prior probability.
   - Computer Science is a very common field for graduate students.
   - Estimate: 0.25

2. P(E|H): The likelihood of the evidence given this field.
   - His intelligence and love for solving puzzles fit well with computer science.
   - However, his curiosity about nature and love for animals are less directly aligned.
   - Estimate: 0.4

3. P(E|¬H): The likelihood of the evidence given not this field.
   - There are many other fields and the traits are somewhat general.
   - Estimate: 0.6

### Applying Bayes' Rule:

We need to compute:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since we are only interested in comparison, we can omit dividing by P(E).

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.25 = 0.10 \]

### Normalizing for Comparison:

We calculate the relative probabilities:
\[ P(Agricultural \, and \, Veterinary \, Science|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.10} = \frac{0.04}{0.14} \approx 0.286 \]
\[ P(Computer \, Science|E) = \frac{0.10}{0.04 + 0.10} = \frac{0.10}{0.14} \approx 0.714 \]

Therefore, the final estimates are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.286,
  "computer science": 0.714
}
