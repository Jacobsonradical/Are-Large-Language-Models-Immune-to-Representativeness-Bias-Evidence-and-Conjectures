To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, given that we do not have \( P(E) \) explicitly provided, we can compare the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) for each field based on the values of \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's assign probabilities based on the given personality traits and the likelihood of Adam being in each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. \( P(H) \): This probability represents the prior likelihood of a student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Graduate fields in agriculture and veterinary science aren't as common as some other fields, so let's estimate a moderate prior probability.
   \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \)

2. \( P(E|H) \): This is the probability of Adam having these personality traits given that he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given the strong alignment of his traits (interest in nature, empathy, love for animals) with this field:
   \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of Adam having these personality traits but not being in agricultural and veterinary science. Since nature, empathy, and intelligence can also apply to many other fields:
   \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

### Computer Science
1. \( P(H) \): This probability represents the prior likelihood of a student being enrolled in computer science. Computer science is a very popular graduate field, so we give it a higher prior probability.
   \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)

2. \( P(E|H) \): This is the probability of Adam having these personality traits given that he is studying computer science. Traits like solving puzzles and high intelligence are quite common in computer science students, though empathy and love for nature are less typical:
   \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of Adam having these personality traits but not being in computer science. Given that these traits are somewhat less typical in computer science:
   \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can estimate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) relative to each other:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

### Relative Posterior Probabilities
We are computing these probabilities relative to each other and not in absolute terms, so the exact values will depend on normalizing them collectively with other fields. 

However, for simplicity:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.035,
  "computer science": 0.04
}

Based on these rough estimates, Adam is slightly more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in agricultural and veterinary science according to the given traits and the general popularity of these fields. However, there's still a significant chance he could be in agricultural and veterinary science given his affinities.
