To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we start with \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H). \]

### Hypothesis: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Given Adam’s profile, an interest in nature, plants, and animals aligns well with this field. Therefore, the prior probability \( P(H) \) could be moderate.

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Given that Adam has a deep love for animals and a genuine curiosity about nature, it's highly likely that his background and personality fit well within this field. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) should be high.

#### Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
For many other fields unrelated to nature or animals, Adam’s specific interests would be less relevant. Therefore, \( P(E|\neg H) \) should be low.

### Hypothesis: Computer Science
#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts could fit well with computer science. So, the prior probability \( P(H) \) could be moderate.

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Although his high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills could be beneficial in this field, his strong connection with nature and love for animals are not directly relevant. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) should be moderate to low.

#### Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
As computer science is just one among many potential fields, many others can also be a fit based on Adam’s skills and interests. Hence, \( P(E|\neg H) \) would have a similar spread.

### Calculations (Normalized)

Let's assume:
- Prior probability \( P(H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is 0.3.
- Prior probability \( P(H) \) for Computer Science is 0.3.

Qualitative assumptions for likelihoods:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural}}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer}}) \approx 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.3 \)

Normalization is necessary to ensure probabilities are accurate relative measures.

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E_{\text{agricultural}}) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}})P(H_{\text{agricultural}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E_{\text{agricultural}}) = P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}})P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural}})P(\neg H_{\text{agricultural}}) \]
\[ P(E_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.8 \times 0.3 + 0.2 \times 0.7. \]
\[ P(E_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.24 + 0.14 = 0.38 \]
\[ P(H|E_{\text{agricultural}}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{0.38} \approx 0.63 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E_{\text{computer science}}) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}})P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)}, \]
\[ P(E_{\text{computer science}}) = P(E|H_{\text{computer science}})P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}})P(\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) \],
\[ P(E_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \times 0.3 + 0.3 \times 0.7. \]
\[ P(E_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.15 + 0.21 = 0.36 \]
\[ P(H|E_{\text{computer science}}) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{0.36} \approx 0.42 \]

Thus, the required probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.63,
  "computer science": 0.42
