To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's how we can break down the steps:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability that Adam would be enrolled in a particular field, without any additional information. This can be seen as the general likelihood of graduate students being in that field.
  
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence (personality traits of Adam) given that Adam is in that particular field.

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch of Adam), considering all possible fields. This acts as a normalizing factor.

4. **Complementary Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence if Adam is not in the specified field. This helps us understand the influence of the field on the personality sketch.

Using the given fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Assume the prior probability of a student being in this field is moderate, say 0.05.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's traits align well with this field (interest in nature, empathy, love for animals). Assign a high probability, say 0.8.
- **Complementary Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of these traits given Adam is not in this field can be relatively lower, say 0.2.

Calculate using:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Assume a higher prior probability for being in a popular field like computer science, say 0.15.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's intelligence and interest in puzzles match well, but other factors (nature, empathy) do not. Assign a moderate probability, say 0.3.
- **Complementary Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This can be the overall remaining likelihood when Adam is not in this field, considering the personality traits, say 0.5.

Calculate using:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \) to normalize for comparison, let's denote it as \( P(E) \), then:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \[
    \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} = 0.04 / P(E)
  \],
  "computer science": \[
    \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{P(E)} = 0.045 / P(E)
  \]
}

Removing \( P(E) \) for relative comparison:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.045
}

Based on these rough calculations, it appears Adam has slightly higher posterior probability for being in Computer Science, although both are close and should be refined with more detailed prior probabilities and likelihoods.

Feel free to adjust values based on more context-specific details.
