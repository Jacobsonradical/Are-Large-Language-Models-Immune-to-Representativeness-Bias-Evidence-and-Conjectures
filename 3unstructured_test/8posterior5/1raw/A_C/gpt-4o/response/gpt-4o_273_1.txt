To solve the problem, let's follow Bayes' Rule:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E| \neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given that \( H \) is not true.

Now, let's estimate these probabilities for both fields:

### Computer Science
1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that a graduate student would be enrolled in computer science. Computer science is a popular field, so let's assume a moderate prior probability, e.g., \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that someone studying computer science would have the described personality attributes. Computer science students might be curious, good at solving puzzles, and intelligent, but the strong empathy and love for animals are less directly related to the field. A moderate to low likelihood, say \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood that someone not studying computer science has the described personality attributes. This should be relatively higher, as the attributes are not particularly tied to any specific field, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that a graduate student would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common than computer science, so let's assume a lower prior probability, e.g., \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that someone studying agricultural and veterinary science would have the described personality attributes. This field closely aligns with the subject's love for animals, plants, and nature, so a higher likelihood, say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood that someone not studying agricultural and veterinary science has the described personality attributes. This should be relatively lower, as the attributes are more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.15 + 0.7 \cdot 0.85 = 0.03 + 0.595 = 0.625
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.625} = \frac{0.03}{0.625} \approx 0.048
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[
   P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.6 \cdot 0.95 = 0.04 + 0.57 = 0.61
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.61} = \frac{0.04}{0.61} \approx 0.066
   \]

Finally, presenting the results:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.048,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.066
}
