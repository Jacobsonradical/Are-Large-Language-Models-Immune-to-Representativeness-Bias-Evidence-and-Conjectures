First, let's outline our reasoning process step-by-step:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field. This is the baseline probability without considering his personality sketch.
    - Given that there are many fields, without more specific information, we might assume that the probabilities are reasonably balanced but may be skewed towards more common graduate fields.
    - I will assume for the sake of simplicity and lack of specific data that computer science and agricultural and veterinary science could have a rough baseline likelihood of being chosen by students. However, agricultural and veterinary science might be slightly less common than computer science.

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was in the specified field. This depends on how well his traits match typical students in these fields.
    - For computer science: While intelligence and interest in puzzles could match, empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature seem less relevant.
    - For agricultural and veterinary science: A deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for dedication align strongly with this field.

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in the specified fields.
    - This needs to account for how common Adam's traits are among grad students in general. His traits seem to better match fields related to nature and animals rather than more abstract or technical fields.

4. **P(H|E):** The posterior probability of Adam being in each field, given the evidence E, can be calculated using Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are not given P(E), we'll use the relative comparison approach:

### For Computer Science:
- **P(H):** Assuming a moderate baseline for a popular field like computer science, let's say 0.15.
- **P(E|H):** The traits match partially, but not strongly. Let's assume 0.1.
- **P(E|¬H):** Considering his traits are quite unique among general grad students: Let’s assume 0.05.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H):** Considering it's slightly less common, let's assume 0.05.
- **P(E|H):** The traits are a strong match, let's assume 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H):** Considering his traits match less common fields overall and his profile fits well here, it might be lower: Let’s assume 0.02.

Now, calculating:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both and irrelevant for relative comparison:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) = 0.1 \times 0.15 = 0.015 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

For normalizing, use:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.04} \approx 0.273 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.015 + 0.04} \approx 0.727 \]

Thus, in the format requested:
