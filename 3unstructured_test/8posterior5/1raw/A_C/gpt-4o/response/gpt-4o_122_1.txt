To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. Estimate \( P(H) \): the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \): the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch matches if he was enrolled in that field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \): the likelihood that Adamâ€™s personality sketch matches if he was not enrolled in that field.
4. Use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \): the posterior probability given the evidence E.

Let's denote:
- \( H_{CS} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{AV} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

### 1. Prior Probability \(P(H)\)
Assume the prior probabilities \( P(H_{CS}) \) and \( P(H_{AV}) \) reflect the general enrollment rates in these fields:
- Computer science is a popular field, so let's estimate \( P(H_{CS}) \) as \( 0.3 \).
- Agricultural and veterinary science is less common, so let's estimate \( P(H_{AV}) \) as \( 0.1 \).

### 2. Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)
Evaluate how well Adam's personality sketch fits each field:
- For \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Adam's high intelligence and abstract thinking fit well, but his deep love for animals and nature less so. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) as \( 0.2 \).
- For \( P(E|H_{AV}) \): Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy fits extremely well. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{AV}) \) as \( 0.8 \).

### 3. Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)
For the likelihood of the sketch given that Adam is not in these fields:
- For \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Considering other fields and distribution of traits, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \) as \( 0.7 \).
- For \( P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \): It seems less likely in most other fields, so let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \) as \( 0.4 \).

### 4. Compute Posterior Probability \(P(H|E)\)
Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.7 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.49} = \frac{0.06}{0.55} \approx 0.109 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.36} = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \approx 0.182 \]

The posterior probabilities are:
