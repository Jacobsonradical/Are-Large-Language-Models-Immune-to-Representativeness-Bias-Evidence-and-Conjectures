To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor and remains constant for all hypotheses, we can compare \( P(H|E) \) for different hypotheses using the numerator alone:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's evaluate the probabilities for each field:

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
    - Due to the popularity and high enrollment rates in Computer Science among graduate students in the U.S., let's assign a reasonably high prior probability.
    - \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
    - "Understanding abstract concepts" aligns well with Computer Science.
    - Solving puzzles is a skill often associated with algorithm design and coding.
    - Other personality traits like empathy and love for animals don't directly correlate with typical Computer Science characteristics.
    - However, given high alignment with some traits, letâ€™s assign a moderate likelihood.
    - \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \)

3. **Probability of Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
    - For other fields, the chance of this specific combination (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, high intelligence, etc.) will be lower but not extremely low.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
    - Fewer students are enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Computer Science; however, it still has a decent enrollment.
    - \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
    - Traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align very well with this field.
    - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \)

3. **Probability of Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
    - The specific combination of traits fits less well with non-agricultural, non-veterinary fields, but still possible.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.3 \)

### Computing Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \)

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Normalizing these values for comparison, we get:

\[ \text{Total} = 0.12 + 0.08 = 0.20 \]

So:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.20} = 0.6 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.20} = 0.4 \]

Therefore, the probabilities would be:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
