Sure, let's use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence across all fields.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Assume a relatively low prior because of the broad range of possible graduate fields, let's estimate it as \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work, the personality sketch fits very well. Let's estimate a high likelihood, \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability that Adam has the same personality sketch but is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that these traits can also relate to some other fields, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

### 2. Computer Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Assume a similar prior as above, given broad range of possible fields, let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's traits like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit well with computer science, though his stronger connection to nature and animals might reduce this fit. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability that Adam has the same personality sketch but is not in computer science. Given the unique combination of nature and puzzle-solving traits, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \) assuming some overlap with other technical or science fields.

Using Bayes' rule and simplifying as \( P(E) \) is constant for comparison:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Thus,
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.1 = 0.05 \]

Finally, normalizing these probabilities by dividing by the sum of both values:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.05} \approx 0.615 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.08 + 0.05} \approx 0.385 \]

Therefore, the resulting probabilities are:
