To compute \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of his personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of his personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence (his personality sketch), which can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

It's essential to make assumptions to estimate these probabilities. Based on the personality sketch of Adam, let's evaluate each field.

### Computer Science

**P(H) for Computer Science:** 
Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is studying Computer Science is around 0.2 (a reasonable guess given the popularity of the field).

**P(E|H) for Computer Science:**
His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with Computer Science. But his deep love for animals and nature is less directly related. Let's give this a likelihood of 0.2.

**P(E|\neg H) for Computer Science:** 
Let's estimate the likelihood that someone who is not in Computer Science would have this personality sketch to be somewhat higher considering that such traits might be more common in fields related to nature and animals. A value of 0.6 might be reasonable.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** 
Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science is around 0.1 (a reasonable guess given the less common nature of the field).

**P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field. Let's give this a likelihood of 0.8.

**P(E|\neg H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
If not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, other traits might be less aligned. Let's estimate a likelihood of 0.5.

Given these assumptions, let's compute the probabilities using Bayes' rule:

### Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.48 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.52 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.52} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.52} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.077 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.53 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.53} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.53} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.151 \]

So, the computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.151
}
```
