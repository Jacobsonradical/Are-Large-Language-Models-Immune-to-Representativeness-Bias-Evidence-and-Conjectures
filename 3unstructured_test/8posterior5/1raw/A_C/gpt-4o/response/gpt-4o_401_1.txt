Here's the reasoning:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam would be in this field might be moderate, as there are many fields a graduate student can choose. Let's assume it is 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Given his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it seems quite likely that he would choose a field like agricultural and veterinary science. This probability could be around 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H)**: For other fields not related to agricultural and veterinary science, his profile might still fit other sciences and fields, but with less specificity. This could be about 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.32} = \frac{0.16}{0.48} = 0.333 \]

Given all the considerations and the strong match of his personality, I estimated a higher likelihood at around 0.7, considering the qualitative alignment.

2. **Computer Science**

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam would be in this field is also moderate. Let's assume it is 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Given his intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, it is possible he could be in computer science. However, his strong interest in nature and animals makes it less likely. This probability might be around 0.3.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Similarly to the other field, this would be lower, at around 0.4, as he might fit other profiles but doesn't perfectly align.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.32} = \frac{0.06}{0.38} \approx 0.158 \]

Given all the considerations and focusing on how his love for nature and animals likely outweighs the alignment with computer science, I estimated around 0.1.
