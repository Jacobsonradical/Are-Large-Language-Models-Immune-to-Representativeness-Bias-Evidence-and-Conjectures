To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field through Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

1. \( P(H) \): The base rate probability of being enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of exhibiting the characteristics described in E given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of exhibiting the characteristics described in E given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

For the sake of simplicity, we assume \(P(H)\) and \(P(\neg H)\) are equally likely, as we do not have specific information regarding their base rates apart from indicating they are not the only graduate fields.

Let's assess each component for both fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Agricultural and veterinary science likely has a smaller base rate among all graduate fields, but not negligible.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's characteristics (empathy and love for animals, deep appreciation for nature, understanding hard work, etc.) highly align with this field.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: These traits are generally rarer among the general population of graduate students not in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Computer science has a high base rate among all graduate fields.
- **P(E|H)**: Certain traits like high intelligence and puzzle-solving align, but others like empathy, love for animals, and nature curiosity are less typical.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Traits like empathy and deep appreciation for nature are even less common in non-computer science fields.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's approximate the probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (assuming agriculture-related fields are less common)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)
   
2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (assuming computer science is a popular field)
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \) (some characteristics align well, others less)
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

Let's compute \( P(E) \):

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.19 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Then, \( P(H|E) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.32 \]

Then, \( P(H|E) \) for Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.25 \]

Thus, we can conclude:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

These values reflect the likelihoods based on the provided scenarios and should be interpreted with our assumed probabilities.
