To compute P(H|E) for each field of study using Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. P(E|H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch (E) given that he is in the specified field.
3. P(E|¬H): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in the specified field.

We then use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Since we don't have actual numerical values, I will estimate these probabilities based on the given personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**:
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science is among the possible fields given Adam’s interest in nature, plants, and animals.
   - Let's estimate **P(H) = 0.15** (i.e., 15%).

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - Adam's qualities such as a love for animals, nature, and empathy fit well in this field.
   - Let's estimate **P(E|H) = 0.7** (i.e., 70%).

3. **P(E|¬H)**:
   - Considering that there are many graduate fields, and while Adam's traits are a good fit here, they could overlap with other fields (e.g., Biology, Environmental Science).
   - Let's estimate **P(E|¬H) = 0.1** (i.e., 10%).

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**:
   - Computer Science is a common graduate field, but based on Adam's personality, it seems less likely than Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Let's estimate **P(H) = 0.05** (i.e., 5%).

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - While Adam’s intelligence and ability to solve puzzles can fit Computer Science, other traits like empathy and love for animals aren’t typical indicators.
   - Let's estimate **P(E|H) = 0.3** (i.e., 30%).

3. **P(E|¬H)**:
   - Given that Adam's personality fits various fields but less so with Computer Science, the probability that such a personality sketch exists without Adam being in Computer Science is relatively high.
   - Let's estimate **P(E|¬H) = 0.15** (i.e., 15%).

### Calculations

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.15) + (0.1 \times 0.85) = 0.105 + 0.085 = 0.19 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.15}{0.19} = \frac{0.105}{0.19} \approx 0.55 \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.05) + (0.15 \times 0.95) = 0.015 + 0.1425 = 0.1575 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.05}{0.1575} = \frac{0.015}{0.1575} \approx 0.095 \]

Thus the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.55,
  "computer science": 0.095
}
