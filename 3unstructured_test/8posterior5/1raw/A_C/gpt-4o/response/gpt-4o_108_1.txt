To calculate the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch (E), we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only interested in the relative probabilities, we can leave the denominator \(P(E)\) out of the equation for direct comparison. We'll focus on computing the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field and then normalize these values.

### Computer Science

1. **\(P(H)\)**:
   - Computer science is a popular graduate field, so we'll assume a moderate prior probability. Let's say \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.20 \).

2. **\(P(E|H)\)**:
   - High intelligence and being good at understanding abstract concepts fit well with a computer science background.
   - However, a deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and strong empathy don't strongly correlate with typical traits for a computer science student.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \).

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - This represents the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in any other field.
   - Given that the sketch does not strongly align with computer science, the overall chances Adam has these traits outside of CS might be similar.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7 \).

Using these values:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.20 = 0.08 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\(P(H)\)**:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science is less commonly chosen compared to something like computer science, but the sketch strongly aligns.
   - Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.05 \).

2. **\(P(E|H)\)**:
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart strongly align with traits typical for someone in this field.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.8 \).

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   - This represents the probability of having this personality sketch in any other field.
   - Given the congruence with agricultural and veterinary science, having these traits outside this field might not be as common.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.5 \).

Using these values:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}} | E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

### Normalizing the Results
To compare the probabilities, we normalize the computed values.

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) &= \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.04} = \frac{0.08}{0.12} \approx 0.67 \\
P(H_{\text{AgVet}} | E) &= \frac{0.04}{0.08 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.12} \approx 0.33 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Combining this and presenting in the desired format:

```
{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.33
}
```

These values indicate the relative likelihood of Adam being in either of these fields given his personality sketch.
