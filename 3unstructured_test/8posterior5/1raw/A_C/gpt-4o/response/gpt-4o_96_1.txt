To use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to apply the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have a detailed prior distribution \( P(H) \) for different hypotheses (fields of study) or a comprehensive probability \( P(E) \), we'll make reasonable qualitative assessments for these probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H):** Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Given Adam’s love for nature, animals, and dedication, it seems reasonably likely. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) = 0.15.

2. **P(E|H):** Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Adam's characteristics align well with someone in this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) = 0.8.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - While his traits could align with other fields, it might be less likely compared to when he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science.
   - Computer Science is a very common field and Adam’s high intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles fit well, even if it doesn’t fully align with his love of nature. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) = 0.2.

2. **P(E|H):** Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in Computer Science.
   - Some aspects fit well (solving puzzles, high intelligence), but others (love of nature and animals) are less typical. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) = 0.4.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in Computer Science.
   - Adam's nature-oriented traits might be more often seen outside of Computer Science. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.5.

Now, let's apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E)_\text{agriculture} = \frac{P(E|H)_\text{agriculture} \cdot P(H)_\text{agriculture}}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both hypotheses, we can simplify our comparison and only need to calculate the numerator to compare the relative probabilities.

\[ P(H|E)_\text{agriculture} \propto P(E|H)_\text{agriculture} \cdot P(H)_\text{agriculture} = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_\text{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_\text{CS} \cdot P(H)_\text{CS}}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E)_\text{CS} \propto P(E|H)_\text{CS} \cdot P(H)_\text{CS} = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

By comparing these proportional values, it's clear that Adam's traits are more aligned with Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on the given probabilities.
