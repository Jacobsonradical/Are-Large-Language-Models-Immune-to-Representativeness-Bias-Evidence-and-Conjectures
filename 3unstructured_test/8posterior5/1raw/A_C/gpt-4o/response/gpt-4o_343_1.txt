To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we start by applying the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the components for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Step 1: Prior probability \( P(H) \)
- Let's assume a prior probability of students being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is around 0.05 (5%), given that it's a specialized field.

#### Step 2: Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, these traits align very well with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Suppose we estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).

#### Step 3: \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- The probability of observing the personality traits of E if Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower.
- Suppose we estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \).

### Computer Science

#### Step 1: Prior probability \( P(H) \)
- Let's assume a prior probability of students being enrolled in computer science is around 0.15 (15%), given its popularity among graduate fields.

#### Step 2: Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- Considering Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, these traits are beneficial for computer science but are not unique to it.
- Suppose we estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \).

#### Step 3: \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- The probability of observing the personality traits of E if Adam is not in computer science might still be moderate, as these traits can be found in other fields as well.
- Suppose we estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

### Computing \( P(H|E) \)

Using the general form of Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times (1 - 0.05)) = 0.035 + 0.095 = 0.13 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.13} = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \approx 0.269 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.15) + (0.3 \times (1 - 0.15)) = 0.06 + 0.255 = 0.315 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{0.315} = \frac{0.06}{0.315} \approx 0.19 \]

Therefore, the responses are:
