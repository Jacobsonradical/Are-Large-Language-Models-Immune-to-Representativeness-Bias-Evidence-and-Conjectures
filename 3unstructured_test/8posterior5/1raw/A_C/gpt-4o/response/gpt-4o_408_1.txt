To compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for Adam's field of study using Bayes' Rule, we need to define the following terms:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the given field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in some other field.
4. \(P(E)\): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the information provided and make reasonable assumptions for each field.

### Computer Science
1. **Prior \(P(H)\)**: Let's assume a moderate prior probability for a graduate student to be in Computer Science due to its popularity. Let's estimate \(P(H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.2\).
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: somewhat unlikely
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: highly likely
   - Warm heart and love for animals: somewhat neutral or unlikely
   - High intelligence and abstract concepts: highly likely
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work: highly likely
   
   Overall, \(P(E|H)_{\text{CS}}\) is moderate. Let's estimate it as 0.4.
3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: Consider the traits that are less aligned with typical Computer Science profiles out of the entire pool of other fields. Let's estimate it as 0.3.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior \(P(H)\)**: This field is less common overall, but Adam's traits align well with it. Let's assume a lower prior for enrollment but increase it given Adam’s traits. Estimate \(P(H)_{\text{AgVet}} = 0.05\).
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: highly likely
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: moderately likely
   - Warm heart and love for animals: highly likely
   - High intelligence and abstract concepts: moderately likely
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work: highly likely
   
   Overall, \(P(E|H)_{\text{AgVet}}\) is high. Let's estimate it as 0.8.
3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: For other fields not aligned with Adam’s traits. Let’s estimate this as 0.2.

For simplicity, assume:
\[ P(E) \approx 1 \text{ (constant for comparison purposes)} \]

Now, compute \(P(H|E)\):

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{CS}}}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{1} = 0.08 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{AgVet}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{AgVet}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{AgVet}}}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{1} = 0.04 \]

Now, let’s report the probabilities as requested:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
}
```

Please note these values are estimated and could be adjusted with more specific contextual data.
