Let's break down the problem according to Bayes' theorem. We are given a personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, and we need to estimate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of "agricultural and veterinary science" and "computer science".

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence \( E \).

Let's reason out the values for each hypothesis.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**:
   - Let's assume that graduate fields are reasonably distributed. We might estimate \( P(H) \) for "agricultural and veterinary science" to be relatively low, as it's a more specialized field compared to broader fields such as computer science. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**:
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart align strongly with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Complementary Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**:
   - This is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that most other fields wouldn't align as closely with Adam's characteristics, we might estimate it to be lower. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**:
   - Computer science is a very common field for graduate students, so we might estimate a higher \( P(H) \). Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**:
   - Adam is intelligent and enjoys solving puzzles, which are relevant traits for computer science, but his curiosity about nature and love for animals are not directly aligned. However, let's assume a moderate probability. \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. **Complementary Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**:
   - This is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science. This might be moderately high because his traits are still somewhat broad and can fit various fields. Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

### Posterior Probability Calculation

We need \( P(E) \) which can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given the assumptions:

- For "agricultural and veterinary science":
  \[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.1739 \]

- For "computer science":
  \[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.15) + (0.5 \times 0.85) = 0.06 + 0.425 = 0.485 \]
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{0.485} \approx 0.1237 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1739,
  "computer science": 0.1237
}
```
