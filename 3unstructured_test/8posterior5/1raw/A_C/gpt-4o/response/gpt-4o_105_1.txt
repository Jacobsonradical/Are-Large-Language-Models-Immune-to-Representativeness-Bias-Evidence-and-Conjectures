Let's break down the problem by assessing the probabilities step by step for each field.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**: Let's assume the likelihood that a random graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
   - P(H_computer_science): Computer science is a popular field, so let's assume a higher probability but not overwhelmingly so. Let's estimate: 
     \[
     P(H_{\text{computer\_science}}) = 0.20
     \]

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood of Evidence Given Hypothesis**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits if he is in computer science.
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, warm heart, and empathy seem weakly connected to computer science compared to other fields.
     \[
     P(E|H_{\text{computer\_science}}) = 0.1
     \]

3. **P(E|¬H) - Likelihood of Evidence Given Not Hypothesis**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits if he is not in computer science.
   - Given that the personality traits are better aligned with fields like agricultural and veterinary science, the probability that a student not in computer science has these traits would be higher.
     \[
     P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer\_science}}) = 0.3
     \]

4. **Calculating P(H|E) Through Bayes' Rule**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   Using the numbers:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{computer\_science}} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} ≈ 0.077
   \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**: Let's assume the likelihood that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - This field is less common than computer science but more aligned with Adam's traits. Let's estimate:
     \[
     P(H_{\text{ag\_vet\_science}}) = 0.10
     \]

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood of Evidence Given Hypothesis**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits if he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Adam’s personality traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
     \[
     P(E|H_{\text{ag\_vet\_science}}) = 0.7
     \]

3. **P(E|¬H) - Likelihood of Evidence Given Not Hypothesis**: The likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given that Adam’s traits are less aligned with most other fields, this probability would be lower:
     \[
     P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag\_vet\_science}}) = 0.2
     \]

4. **Calculating P(H|E) Through Bayes' Rule**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   Using the numbers:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{ag\_vet\_science}} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28
   \]

### Final Results
Combining the estimates, we get:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28
}
