To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields given his personality sketch, we need to do this through Bayesian inference. Here's a step-by-step process for each field:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in a specific field. Given the absence of specific prior data, we assume a somewhat uniform distribution with slight adjustments based on typical graduate field frequencies.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is in a specific field. This requires judging how well his described traits match each field.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is not in a specific field. This represents a baseline which reflects how common these traits might be across all other fields.

4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability of Adam being in a specific field given his personality sketch, calculated using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here we assume a simplifying uniform approach to P(E), as the denominator doesnâ€™t change our relative comparison.

### Calculations

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Let's conservatively estimate a low prior since agricultural and veterinary science is less common than fields like computer science.
  - P(H) = 0.05

- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy), these are highly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.
  - P(E|H) = 0.8

- **P(E|\neg H)**: Since these traits are quite specific, it is less likely for people outside this field to exhibit them strongly compared to those within it.
  - P(E|\neg H) = 0.2

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

#### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Computer science is a very common field among graduate students.
  - P(H) = 0.15

- **P(E|H)**: Adam's intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts are highly relevant for computer science. However, some of his other characteristics (like curiosity about nature and love for animals) are less typical for this field.
  - P(E|H) = 0.3

- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given that computer science has less direct alignment with Adam's specific traits compared to agricultural and veterinary science, the probability that these traits are not specific to computer science needs to be adjusted.
  - P(E|\neg H) = 0.6

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \]

### Relative Probabilities

The comparison of \( \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \) for agricultural and veterinary science and \( \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \) for computer science shows relatively close probabilities. Because these estimates are subjective and certain assumptions might be biased, having a higher value in the denominator (\( P(E|H) \times P(H) \)) slightly favors computer science, even though qualitatively, the personality traits seem to align better with agricultural and veterinary science.

However, Bayesian inference may revise and refine upon more specific prior probabilities and more comprehensive data.
