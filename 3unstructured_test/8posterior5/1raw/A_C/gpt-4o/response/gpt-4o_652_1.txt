To solve this problem, we'll first state some assumptions about the probabilities:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in a given field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in a given field.
4. \(P(H|E)\): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field given his personality traits, which we compute using Bayes' theorem.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**
   - Let's assume that the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.1 (10%), since it is a less common field compared to something like computer science.

2. **Probability \(P(E|H)\)**
   - Given Adam's strong love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, and warm heart, it is very likely for someone in this field to have these traits. Thus, \(P(E|H)\) can be estimated as 0.8 (80%).

3. **Probability \(P(E|\neg H)\)**
   - For students who are not in agricultural and veterinary science, we would estimate a lower probability of having such specific personality traits. Let's assume this to be 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{(0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3077 \]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**
   - Let's assume that the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is 0.2 (20%), given its popularity among graduate students.

2. **Probability \(P(E|H)\)**
   - Considering Adam’s intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles, it's somewhat likely he could be in computer science, though the specific traits don't strongly indicate computer science. Let’s estimate \(P(E|H)\) as 0.4 (40%).

3. **Probability \(P(E|\neg H)\)**
   - For students not in computer science but have the described traits, it might be slightly lower but not dramatically different. Let’s assume this to be 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{(0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.24} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.32} \]

\[ P(H|E) = 0.25 \]
