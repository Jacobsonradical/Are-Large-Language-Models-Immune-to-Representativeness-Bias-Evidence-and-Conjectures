To compute the probabilities P(H|E) that Adam was enrolled in either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "computer science", we need to evaluate the prior probabilities P(H), the likelihoods P(E|H), and the likelihoods under the complementary hypothesis P(E|\neg H). Once we have these, we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of E.

Since we don't have exact numerical values, I'll estimate the probabilities based on the information provided in the personality sketch of Adam.

Let's first evaluate P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a U.S. graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this field is relatively small compared to other fields, so \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits if he is enrolled in this field. Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work, this seems high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is not in this field. Given his traits could still apply to other fields, but less so for computer science (although they might fit other fields like medical sciences), let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a U.S. graduate student is in computer science. This field is quite popular, so let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits if he is enrolled in this field. While he is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, the strong empathy, and love for animals don't directly fit computer science as well. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is not in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) to reflect that the traits might be more common in other non-computer science fields.

Assuming the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) is tricky without more information, but since it is a constant for both fields, we can neglect it for the proportion calculations.

Now, applying Bayes' rule proportionally:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

So for agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

And for computer science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Now, normalizing these probabilities so that their sum is 1:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.08} = \frac{0.04}{0.12} \approx 0.333 \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.04 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.12} \approx 0.667 \]

However, considering there are various other fields, let's provide the values in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.333",
  "computer science": "0.667"
