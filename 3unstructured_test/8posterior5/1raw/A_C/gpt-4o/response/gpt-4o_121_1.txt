To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular graduate field given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While it isn't possible to provide exact probabilities without more data, we can approximate these values based on common knowledge and general assumptions.

Let's consider:

- \( P(H) \) = The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) = The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Given the data:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a prior probability that enrollment in computer science has moderate commonality among graduate students. Let's say \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's characteristics include high intelligence and an interest in abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science. However, his love for nature and animals isn't directly aligned. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assume there are many fields where one might exhibit Adam's characteristics, making \( P(E|\neg H) \) relatively high. Let's estimate it at about \( 0.7 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.5} \approx 0.12 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume a prior probability that enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science is less common than computer science but still notable. Let's say \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's characteristics fit well with this field, given his curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): As above, assume there are many other fields fitting Adam's characteristics, so \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.5} \approx 0.16 \]

Based on these calculations, the approximate values are:

{
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16
}

These values suggest that, given the personality sketch, Adam is slightly more likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than computer science.
