To apply Bayes' rule and compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to evaluate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the normalizing factor which involves \( P(E|\neg H) \). Note that \(\neg H\) represents the hypothesis that Adam is enrolled in a field other than \(H\).

### Given information:
- \(H_{\text{CS}}\) : Hypothesis that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \(H_{\text{AgriVet}}\) : Hypothesis that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(E\) : Personality sketch of Adam.

### Prior probabilities \( P(H) \)
Since I don't have specific data on the proportion of graduate students in each field, assume a smaller prior probability for agricultural and veterinary sciences compared to computer science due to the typical distribution. We'll make rough estimates:
- \(P(H_{\text{CS}})\) ≈ 0.3
- \(P(H_{\text{AgriVet}})\) ≈ 0.1

### Likelihood probabilities \( P(E|H) \)
The likelihoods are based on how well the personality sketch fits each hypothesis:
- For computer science, the curiosity about nature and its various plants is somewhat less typical, but high intelligence and abstract thinking fit. So, \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is moderate, say 0.3.
- For agricultural and veterinary science, the curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy fit very well. So, \( P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \) is high, say 0.7.

### Normalizing factor \( P(E|\neg H) \)
We need to consider how likely the personality sketch \(E\) is given that Adam is enrolled in some other unspecified field. Given the general nature of the description fitting into various fields, we'll estimate a moderate likelihood:
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \) ≈ 0.2
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \) ≈ 0.25

### Applying Bayes' rule
Bayes' rule for updating our hypothesis is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

#### For computer science:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.14 = 0.23 \]

Now,
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.23} \approx 0.39 \]

#### For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.25 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.225 = 0.295 \]

Now,
\[ P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.295} \approx 0.24 \]

The computed probabilities are thus:

{
  "computer science": 0.39,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24
}
