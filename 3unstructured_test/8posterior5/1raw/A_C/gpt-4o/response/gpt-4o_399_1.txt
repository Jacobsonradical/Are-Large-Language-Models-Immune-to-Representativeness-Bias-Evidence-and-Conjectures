Sure, let’s go through the calculations step by step for the two fields: agricultural and veterinary science, and computer science.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Calculation
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Without specific data, this could be based on the proportion of students in this field relative to all graduate fields, but I will assume a reasonable base rate for individual assessment. Let’s assume P(H) = 0.10.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's love for animals, plants, and nature, this is quite high. Let’s estimate P(E|H) = 0.80.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Students in other fields may also have similar interests, but it would generally be lower. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.20.

#### Bayes Rule Calculation
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

Using the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.10) + (0.20 \times 0.90) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Thus, 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.10}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### 2. Computer Science

#### Calculation
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Again, assuming a general proportion, let’s estimate P(H) = 0.15.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality given he is in computer science. Curiosity and puzzle-solving align with computer science, but love for nature and animals might not be as strongly associated. Let’s estimate P(E|H) = 0.30.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality if he is not in computer science, possibly affected by our assumption in the previous case. Let’s keep it consistent and assume P(E|¬H) = 0.20.

#### Bayes Rule Calculation
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

Using the given values:
\[ P(E) = (0.30 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.045 + 0.17 = 0.215 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \times 0.15}{0.215} \approx 0.2093 \]

Finally, let’s summarize these probabilities.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "computer science": 0.2093
