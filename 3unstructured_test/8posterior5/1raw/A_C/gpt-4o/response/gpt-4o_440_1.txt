To use Bayes' Rule to compute the probabilities \(P(H|E)\), let's break it down based on the given information and use some reasonable assumptions for the priors and likelihoods.

First, recall Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For both fields, we'll calculate:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in that field.

From \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), we can calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior \(P(H)\):** Let's assume a reasonable field distribution and say the prior is fairly inclusive of students interested in these fields.
   \[ P(H) = 0.10 \]

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):** Given Adam's characteristics, it's highly likely that someone in agricultural and veterinary science would fit the personality description:
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.85 \]

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\):** For fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, the personality description is less likely to fit this well:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \]

We compute \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.85 \cdot 0.10) + (0.30 \cdot 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.085 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.355 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.85 \cdot 0.10}{0.355} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.239 \]

### Computer Science
1. **Prior \(P(H)\):** Let's assume that the distribution for computer science is similar:
   \[ P(H) = 0.15 \]

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):** Given the personality sketch, it's moderately likely that someone in computer science might fit the description:
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.50 \]

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\):** For fields other than computer science, the personality description is less likely to fit exactly:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.35 \]

We compute \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.50 \cdot 0.15) + (0.35 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.075 + 0.2975 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3725 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.15}{0.3725} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.202 \]

Here's the final result:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.239",
  "computer science": "0.202"
}
```
This means that given Adam's personality sketch, there is approximately a 23.9% probability that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, and a 20.2% probability that he was enrolled in computer science.
