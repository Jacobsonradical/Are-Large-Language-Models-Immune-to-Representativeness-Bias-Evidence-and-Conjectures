Let's denote:

- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) as the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(H|E) \) as the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.

To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are only comparing between the two specific fields, we don't need to compute \( P(E) \) explicitly when comparing them directly, as it acts as a normalizing constant.  

**Let's estimate these probabilities for each field:**

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): A rough estimate for the prior probability that a graduate student might be in computer science might be around 0.2 (since it's a popular field).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals might be lower in probability for computer science students, so let's say 0.1.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given Adam's personality fits well with non-computer science fields, let's say this would be 0.7.

Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

Let's calculate:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.58} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.034 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Given it's more specialized, let's estimate the prior at 0.05.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature much better fit this field, so let's estimate it at 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given the strong match, \( \neg H \) would have less chance of fitting, say 0.4.

Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

Let's calculate:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.4 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.095 \]

So, based on the calculations:

{
  "computer science": 0.034,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.095
}
