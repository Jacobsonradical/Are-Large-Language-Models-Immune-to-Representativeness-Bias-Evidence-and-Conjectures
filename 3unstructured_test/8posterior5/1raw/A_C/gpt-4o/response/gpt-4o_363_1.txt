To answer this question, I'll make reasoned estimates for the necessary probabilities based on both the personality sketch and the general trends of graduate fields of study. Note that these estimates are subjective and based on the information provided. 

Let P(H) be the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field H, P(E|H) be the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in H, and P(E|¬H) be the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in H.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it's somewhat specialized, not as common as other fields.
   - **Estimate**: 0.05

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing E given that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science. His love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy strongly aligns with this field.
   - **Estimate**: 0.7

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam was not in agricultural and veterinary science. These traits could exist in other fields, though less likely to match this well.
   - **Estimate**: 0.1

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.095 = 0.13 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.13} \approx \frac{0.035}{0.13} \approx 0.27 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is in computer science. This is a highly popular field.
   - **Estimate**: 0.2

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing E given that Adam was in computer science. High intelligence, puzzle-solving, and appreciation for dedication match this field, but less emphasis on nature and animals.
   - **Estimate**: 0.3

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam was not in computer science. These traits are quite generic, except for his nature and animal preferences, which are less specific to common fields.
   - **Estimate**: 0.1

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.14} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.43 \]

Based on these calculations, the probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.27,
  "computer science": 0.43
}
```

These numbers indicate that, given the personality sketch E, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in computer science despite certain traits aligning well with agricultural and veterinary science. However, neither probability is particularly high, reflecting the diverse possibilities of graduate fields.
