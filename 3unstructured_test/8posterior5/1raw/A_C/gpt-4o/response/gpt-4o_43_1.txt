To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we need to follow Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since the total probabilities do not need to sum to 1 due to other possible graduate fields, we can analyze only the relative probabilities. Let's define the terms involved:

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a certain field.
  - We will assume equal priors for simplicity, i.e., \( P(H) \) is the same for all considered fields because we don't have prior information to favor one over the other.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in a certain field.
  - This will depend on how well Adam’s traits align with typical students in those fields.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that field.
  - This will be a baseline for comparison but will not be explicitly calculated since we are looking at relative values.

We can assume:

- \( P(H) \approx 0.5 \) if each of the two fields is equally likely a priori.

Now, let’s consider the contribution of personality traits to the fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, a love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication which aligns very well with agricultural and veterinary sciences.
   - \( P(E|H) \) would be high for this field due to a strong match.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts which could also indicate an aptitude for computer science. However, his love for animals and plants fits less naturally with this field.
   - \( P(E|H) \) would be moderate for this field due to partial alignment.

Given this qualitative analysis:

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) (high likelihood because of strong alignment with many aspects of his personality sketch)

- For **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \) (moderate likelihood as it partially aligns with his problem-solving skills and intelligence but less so with his empathy for animals and nature)

Using Bayes' Rule and ignoring the normalizing constant since we are only asked for relative values, we get:

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.5 = 0.4
  \]

- For **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.5 = 0.15
  \]

So, if we input these values into the required format, we get:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```
