To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for both hypotheses (agricultural and veterinary science, and computer science), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of E given H (the likelihood that the personality sketch matches someone in that field).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of E given not H.
- \( P(E) \): Total probability of E, which can be calculated using the law of total probability.

However, exact numerical values for the priors and likelihoods aren't provided explicitly, thus we'll make reasoned estimates to arrive at our values. For fields more aligned with Adam's personality, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) will be higher.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: Higher probability, given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals.
2. **P(E|H)**: High, since his personality matches well with the traits desirable in these fields.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Low to moderate, since while empathy and intelligence are useful in many fields, his specific interest in nature and animals aligns less well with non-agricultural/veterinary fields.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: Moderate probability, as his intelligence and interest in puzzles are aligned with computer science, but the specifics of his interest in nature and animals don't directly suggest this field.
2. **P(E|H)**: Moderate, his intelligence and skills with abstract concepts relate to computer science.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Moderate, he exhibits general traits that fit multiple disciplines, though less specifically than agricultural and veterinary fields.

We can approximate these probabilities with plausible estimations:

### Probability Estimations

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) = 0.7 \times 0.3 + 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.21 + 0.14 = 0.35 \)

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}} \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.3}{0.35} = \frac{0.21}{0.35} \approx 0.6 \]

For **Computer Science**:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) = 0.4 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8 = 0.08 + 0.24 = 0.32 \)

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Computer Science}} \approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.32} = \frac{0.08}{0.32} \approx 0.25 \]

### Final Results
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

Note: These values are approximations based on reasoning from the given personality sketch and typical alignments with the fields. The actual values may vary with more precise data.
