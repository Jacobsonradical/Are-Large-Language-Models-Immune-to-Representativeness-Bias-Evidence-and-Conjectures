To determine the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch E, we will apply Bayes' theorem, which is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field H.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in field H.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch E.

We'll estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Let's assume the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on the general distribution of graduate students in the U.S. This is a moderate field, so we'll estimate it to be around 0.1 (10%).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam's personality sketch, his interests and empathy towards animals align well with agricultural and veterinary science. This leads us to estimate a high likelihood, such as 0.7 (70%).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
This is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Since his traits can match but not as perfectly as various other fields, let’s give it a moderate likelihood, such as 0.4 (40%).

### Computer Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science is relatively high due to the popularity of this field. We'll estimate it to be around 0.2 (20%).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Computer science fields might appeal to Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills, but less so to his love for nature and animals. Therefore, we'll estimate a moderate likelihood, such as 0.4 (40%).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
Given that Adam's traits might align decently with other fields that are not computer science, we'll use a similar estimate as before: 0.5 (50%).

### Computing Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \) with Bayes' Theorem

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

We don’t have the exact value for \( P(E) \), but we will discuss relative terms:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Thus, comparisons can be made directly proportional:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

**Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Hence, relative likelihoods for Adam being in the respective fields would be calculated.

### Summarized Probability Representation
Given the calculations, the posterior probability still needs to be normalized, but for comparison's sake, here’s the relative format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
```

These values indicate that within the scope of the provided fields, Adam appears slightly more likely to be in computer science, but it doesn't sum to 1 since other potential fields are not considered. Adjustments and normalizations can be done proportionally over a broader scope if further fields’ priors and likelihoods are analyzed systematically.
