Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probabilities. 

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**P(H_agri-vet):** Agricultural and Veterinary Science is a specific but not uncommon field for someone with a deep love for nature, animals, and an appreciation for hard work. Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for being in this field is relatively moderate, say 0.15.

**P(E|H_agri-vet):** The personality traits listed are quite indicative of someone in this field, so the likelihood would be high, say 0.75.

**P(E|¬H_agri-vet):** The probability of having these traits if not enrolled in this field might still be reasonable since students from other fields could also possess these traits, let's estimate it to be 0.2.

**P(H|E) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's compute this:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.75 \cdot 0.15}{0.75 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.15)} = \frac{0.1125}{0.1125 + 0.17} = \frac{0.1125}{0.2825} \approx 0.398 \]

### Computer Science
**P(H_cs):** Computer Science is a popular field, especially in the U.S. for graduate students. Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for being in this field is relatively high, say 0.25.

**P(E|H_cs):** The likelihood of having the mentioned traits as a Computer Science student is moderate since a quiet, puzzle-solving, and intelligent nature can be common. Let's say it's 0.5.

**P(E|¬H_cs):** The probability of having these traits if not enrolled in Computer Science might still be similar, say 0.3.

**P(H|E) for Computer Science:**

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's compute this:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.25}{0.5 \cdot 0.25 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.25)} = \frac{0.125}{0.125 + 0.225} = \frac{0.125}{0.35} \approx 0.357 \]
