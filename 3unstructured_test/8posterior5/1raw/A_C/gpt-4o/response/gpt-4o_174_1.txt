Let's break down the problem and apply Bayes' theorem to compute the probabilities. 

For Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam’s personality sketch would be observed given he is in this field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam’s personality sketch would be observed given he is not in this field.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\))**:
   - Computer science is a common field, but given the attributes, it might not be the most probable field for Adam. Let's assume a prior probability of \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))**:
   - Adam's attributes like high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts fit well with computer science, but his warm heart, love for nature, and empathy might not be as common prioritized traits. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood (\(P(E|\neg H)\))**:
   - The probability of these traits given not in computer science might be a bit higher, as other fields might align better with his nature. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

Using these, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the total probability of observing E) is complex in a multi-field scenario, let's denote it as \( P(E) = k \) for now.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\))**:
   - Given Adam’s love for nature and animals, agricultural and veterinary science fits well. Let's assume a prior probability of \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))**:
   - The traits fit very well with this field. Love for nature, animals, and strong empathy are highly relevant. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood (\(P(E|\neg H)\))**:
   - If not in this field, these traits could still be found but with lesser probability. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

Using these, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Using \( P(E) = k \):

### Summary

After normalizing these results by taking into account \( P(E) \) across all fields, we can compare relative strengths. However, below are the unnormalized posterior values given:

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{k} \approx 0.04 \), 
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{k} \approx 0.16 \)
}

For simplicity and without full normalization:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16
}
```

These values can be used to understand relative probabilities. Normalization would ensure they sum up correctly to represent the full probability distribution.
