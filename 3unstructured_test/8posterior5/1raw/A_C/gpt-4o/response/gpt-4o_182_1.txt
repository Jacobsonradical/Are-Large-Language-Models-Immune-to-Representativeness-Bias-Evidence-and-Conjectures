To begin with, let's break down the calculations for each field.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Given that Computer Science is a popular field for graduate studies, let's assume a moderate prior probability. 
   - Let's assume P(H) = 0.2.

2. **P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Computer Science. 
   - While Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his quiet demeanor, and empathy donâ€™t directly correlate with Computer Science, his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do. However, the affinity for animals and nature suggests that Computer Science isn't the most likely fit.
   - Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Computer Science. Given the prior assumption, we need to factor in other potential fields.
   - Given that his personality aligns better with other fields like Agricultural and Veterinary Science, let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.4.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{(P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H))}
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8)}
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.32}
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.34} \approx 0.059 
   \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. While not as popular as Computer Science, his personality traits align closely with this field.
   - Let's assume P(H) = 0.1.

2. **P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. 
   - Given his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, empathy, and love for animals, this field strongly correlates with his personality.
   - Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.8.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given the prior assumption, we need to factor in other potential fields.
   - Let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.1.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{(P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H))}
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{(0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.1 \cdot 0.9)}
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.09}
   \]

   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.17} \approx 0.471
   \]
