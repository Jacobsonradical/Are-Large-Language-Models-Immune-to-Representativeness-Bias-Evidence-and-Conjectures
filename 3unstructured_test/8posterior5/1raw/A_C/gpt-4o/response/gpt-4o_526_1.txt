To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in each of the fields given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

Since we are comparing two fields, we don’t need the specific value of \( P(E) \) to compare the relative probabilities. Instead, we will focus on the relative values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's analyze each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Generally, agricultural and veterinary science is less common among all possible graduate fields compared to some more popular fields like computer science. Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (an assumption).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, this likelihood would be high for agricultural and veterinary science. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science is lower, but not negligible since there are other fields where such traits are common (like environmental science, biology, etc.). Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now, computing the Bayesian posterior probability:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Computer science is a more common field, so the prior probability is higher. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, but less emphasis on nature and animals, this likelihood would be moderate. Let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Similar to above, the probability of observing Adam’s personality in fields other than computer science is still common. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Now, computing the Bayesian posterior probability:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]

Finally, normalizing these to get a form of relative comparison, we can say:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.1
}
```

Thus, based on the provided sketch of Adam, he is slightly more likely to be enrolled in computer science than agricultural and veterinary science, but neither probability is overwhelmingly strong given other potential fields.
