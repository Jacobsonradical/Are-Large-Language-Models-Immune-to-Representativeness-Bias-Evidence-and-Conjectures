To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch (E), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we have fields of "agricultural and veterinary science" and "computer science":

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field without any knowledge of his personality sketch.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of his personality traits given he is in a particular field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of his personality traits given he is not in that particular field.

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) (the total probability of his personality sketch) is normalized across the two fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science constitute a relatively small proportion compared to the entire graduate population. But we need to make an assumption:
   \[
   P(H_{agricultural}) = 0.05
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science:
   \[
   P(E|H_{agricultural}) = 0.8 
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: For students not in agricultural and veterinary science but in other fields, having the same personality sketch is moderate but less likely compared to someone in agriculture:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{agricultural}) = 0.4
   \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural})}{P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural}) + P(E|\neg H_{agricultural}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{agricultural}))}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.05)}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.4 \cdot 0.95}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.38}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.04}{0.42}
\]
\[
= \frac{4}{42}
\]
\[
= \frac{2}{21} \approx 0.095
\]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Graduate students in computer science are quite a high proportion relative to the overall graduate student population:
   \[
   P(H_{cs}) = 0.15
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Adamâ€™s love for solving puzzles and his high intelligence would fit well with computer science, but his empathy and love for nature are somewhat less correlated:
   \[
   P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.4
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given someone not in computer science, the presence of his personality traits is assumed to be slightly lower:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{cs}) = 0.3
   \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{cs}))}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.4 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.15)}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.255}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.06}{0.315}
\]
\[
= \frac{6}{31.5}
\]
\[
\approx 0.19
\]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.095,
  "computer science": 0.19
}
```
