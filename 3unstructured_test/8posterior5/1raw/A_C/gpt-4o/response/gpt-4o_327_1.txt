In order to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is a constant across different fields and the question only asks for the relative probability between two fields, we can simplify the comparison by focusing only on the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \). This allows us to rank the posterior probabilities relatively.

### Definitions and Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in a given field.
  - For simplicity, assume \( P(H) \) is the same for both fields initially because we're interested in the relative comparison.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) would be observed if he were in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) would be observed if he were in a field other than the given field.

### Evaluations:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Likely high, since this field aligns well with Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Lower, since other fields might not match Adam's traits as closely.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Lower, as the traits in the personality sketch do not directly align with typical computer science interests (e.g., curiosity about nature, deep love for animals).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher, since the personality traits are less specific to computer science and could easily be found in other fields.

Let's assign indicative values to compute the relative probabilities:

### Bayesian Comparison:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Prior Probability: \( P(H) = 0.5 \)
   - Likelihood of Personality Traits: \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.5 = 0.4 \)

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Prior Probability: \( P(H) = 0.5 \)
   - Likelihood of Personality Traits: \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.5 = 0.15 \)

### Relative Posterior Probabilities:
The relative probabilities can be normalized across the two fields to ensure they are compared appropriately.

### Normalization:
Convert the raw scores into probabilities:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   \(P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.15} \approx 0.727\)

2. Computer Science:
   \(P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.4 + 0.15} \approx 0.273\)

### Final Answer:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.727,
  "computer science": 0.273
}
