To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to gather the necessary components:

1. **Prior probability** \( P(H) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in that field before considering the given personality sketch \(E\).
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. **Marginal likelihood** \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality sketch \(E\), which for our purposes can be broken down into \( P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).
4. **Complement likelihood** \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **Prior probability** \( P(H) \): Considering the variety of graduate fields, we might assign a moderate prior, let's say 0.1.

2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): Given the strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this field aligns well with Adam's personality. Let's assign this a high probability, say 0.8.

3. **Complement likelihood** \( P(E|\neg H) \): Among all non-agricultural and veterinary fields, the probability of this personality sketch might be lower. Estimate at 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We estimate:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) =  (0.8*0.1) + (0.3*0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

Then:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

### For Computer Science:
1. **Prior probability** \( P(H) \): Similar moderate prior, let's say 0.1.

2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): His intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles fit well into Computer Science. Assign a moderate probability, say 0.6.

3. **Complement likelihood** \( P(E|\neg H) \): Among all non-computer science fields, let's estimate considering his blend of traits fits better in another contexts such as arts, management etc., assign this a value of 0.4.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We estimate:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) =  (0.6*0.1) + (0.4*0.9) = 0.06 + 0.36 = 0.42 \]

Then:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.42} = \frac{0.06}{0.42} \approx 0.143 \]

### Final Answers:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "computer science": 0.143
}
```

These values give us a Bayesian posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in these respective graduate fields given his personality sketch.
