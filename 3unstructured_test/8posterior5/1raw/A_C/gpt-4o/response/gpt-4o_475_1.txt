To properly judge the probabilities, let's consider different aspects of Adam's personality sketch in relation to each field of specialization.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)** (Prior Probability): Given Adam’s warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants, the prior probability that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high. Let’s estimate this prior probability as 0.4.
   
2. **P(E|H)** (Likelihood):
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - These characteristics align well with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - As such, the likelihood is very high. Let's estimate this as 0.9.

3. **P(E|¬H)** (Likelihood of Evidence given Not H):
   - In non-agricultural fields, the combination of empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature might be less common.
   - However, other fields might still have empathetic individuals who love nature.
   - Let's estimate this as 0.3.

4. **P(H|E)** (Posterior Probability using Bayes Rule):
   - Bayes Rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \)
   - \( P(E) \) is the normalization constant, which incorporates both \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).
   - Without specific value for \( P(E) \), a rough estimation for \( P(H|E) \) can be approximated as:
     \( P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 * 0.4}{0.9 * 0.4 + 0.3 * 0.6} \approx \frac{0.36}{0.36 + 0.18} \approx \frac{0.36}{0.54} \approx 0.67 \).

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)** (Prior Probability): Although Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, fields like computer science attract a wide range of individuals for various reasons. Let’s estimate this prior probability as 0.2.
   
2. **P(E|H)** (Likelihood):
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - These traits align well with computer science, but the alignment isn't as strong as with agricultural science.
   - Let’s estimate this as 0.6.

3. **P(E|¬H)** (Likelihood of Evidence given Not H):
   - In non-computer science fields, the combination of intellectual curiosity, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding abstract concepts is also common in many fields.
   - Let's estimate this as 0.4.

4. **P(H|E)** (Posterior Probability using Bayes Rule):
   - Using Bayes Rule: \( P(H|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \)
   - Approximation for \( P(H|E) \):
     \( P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.6 * 0.2}{0.6 * 0.2 + 0.4 * 0.8} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.32} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.44} \approx 0.27 \).

Therefore, the Bayesian updated probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67,
  "computer science": 0.27
}
