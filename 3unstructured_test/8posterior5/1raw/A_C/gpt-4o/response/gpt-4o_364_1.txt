To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to find \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

However, for simplicity, let's assume we can approximate the necessary probabilities directly for comparison purposes between the two hypotheses.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Let’s assume \( P(H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is around 0.1, as it is relatively specific but not unusual.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Adam's personality sketch, which includes genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work, fits well with this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.8.

3. **Likelihood for other fields \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - Let’s assume that those with Adam's personality are somewhat less likely to be in other fields: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{(0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.308 \]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Let’s assume \( P(H) \) for computer science is higher because it’s a popular field for graduate studies. Estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.2.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Although Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is highly intelligent, which fits well with computer science, his strong love for nature and animals is less directly relevant. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.5.

3. **Likelihood for other fields \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) as consistent with previous.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{(0.5 \times 0.2) + (0.2 \times 0.8)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.16} = \frac{0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.385 \]

Therefore, the computed posterior probabilities for the fields are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.308,
  "computer science": 0.385
}
