Let's start by analyzing each field using the Bayesian framework. According to Bayes' theorem, 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having such a personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that any graduate student would be enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch, which can be considered as a normalization factor.

We do not need the exact value for \( P(E) \) for comparing the two fields since it will be the same for both and thus cancels out in the ratio.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Let's assume that the prior probability of being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is somewhat lower than many other general fields of graduate study. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).

#### Probability \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, and his empathy and love for animals, the probability that he has this personality sketch while being in this field is high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).

#### Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)
For fields other than Agricultural and Veterinary Science, it's less likely that students will commonly have all of Adam's specific traits, but it's not impossible. Let's assume the average probability is around \( 0.1 \).

### Computer Science
#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
Let's assume that the prior probability of being enrolled in Computer Science is higher, given that it is a popular field. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).

#### Probability \( P(E|H) \)
Given Adam's traits, the probability that he would be in Computer Science might be lower since his personality sketch fits less well with the typical traits one might associate with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).

#### Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)
For fields other than Computer Science, Adam's traits may be more or less common. Given the diversity of other fields, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.15 \).

Now let's calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science Calculation

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.035}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science Calculation

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

Comparing the ratios \( \frac{0.035}{P(E)} \) and \( \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \), we see that \( P(H|E) \) is higher for Computer Science. However, considering the fits of the personality sketch to the fields, Agricultural and Veterinary Science should get a stronger lean.

### Final Estimates

To summarize:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Note: While the specific numbers for priors and probabilities can vary based on more detailed data, these estimates show the methodology of using Bayes' theorem to get a qualitative sense of likelihood.
