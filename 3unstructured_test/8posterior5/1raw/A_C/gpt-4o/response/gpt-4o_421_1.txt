To use Bayes' rule, we first need to define and estimate the following probabilities for each field:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- P(E|H): The likelihood of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- P(E|¬H): The likelihood of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.
- P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given the personality sketch E.

Bayes' rule can be stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across different fields when comparing them (it effectively normalizes the probabilities), we can focus on comparing the relative values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Let's estimate the values as follows:

**Computer Science:**
1. P(H): We'll assume that the general prior probability for this field is relatively high, given the popularity of Computer Science.
2. P(E|H): Given the subject's traits, such as high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles, the likelihood is fairly high.
3. P(E|¬H): This is broader but would be lower compared to P(E|H) for fields not related to Computer Science.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
1. P(H): The prior probability for this field is likely lower compared to Computer Science due to its specialized nature.
2. P(E|H): Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and an appreciation for hard work, the likelihood is very high.
3. P(E|¬H): This would be comparatively lower for fields outside of Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Let's estimate specific values for the comparisons:

**Computer Science:**
- P(H_cs) ~ 0.3 (assuming a relatively high prior due to the popularity of the field).
- P(E|H_cs) ~ 0.5 (high due to his intellectual and logical qualities aligning with Comp. Sci.).
- P(E|¬H_cs) ~ 0.1 (as his qualities may not fit many other fields as well).

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- P(H_avs) ~ 0.1 (lower prior due to the specialization).
- P(E|H_avs) ~ 0.8 (very high given the personality traits match well).
- P(E|¬H_avs) ~ 0.2 (somewhat lower since his empathy and nature curiosity could fit here better).

Now using these to find posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

For **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_cs|E) = \frac{P(E|H_cs) \cdot P(H_cs)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{constant} \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_avs|E) = \frac{P(E|H_avs) \cdot P(H_avs)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{constant} \]

Since the denominators are the same, comparing numerators:

For Computer Science:
\[ 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.15 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Lastly, to put these in context (ignoring the constant factor):

{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}

These values indicate the relative likelihoods based on the provided traits and priors.
