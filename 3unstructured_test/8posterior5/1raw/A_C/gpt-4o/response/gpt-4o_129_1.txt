To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E | H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E | \neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in a particular field.

According to Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
For simplicity, we will focus on the ratios rather than actual probabilities. We'll assume \( P(E) \) is constant for all comparisons.

### Prior Probabilities (\( P(H) \))
Let's assign hypothetical prior probabilities based on general enrollment trends and plausibility:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, we can give this field a higher prior probability. Let's say \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **Computer Science**: Although Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which aligns with computer science, the detailed profile suggests more alignment with nature and animals. Let's assign a lower prior probability to this. \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

### Likelihood (\( P(E | H) \))
Next, we consider how likely Adam's personality sketch matches students in those fields:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: High match because of Adam's interest in nature and animals. Let's assign \( P(E | H) = 0.7 \).
- **Computer Science**: Moderate match because of his intelligence and puzzle-solving traits, but not as strong in the context of nature and animals. Let's assign \( P(E | H) = 0.4 \).

### Complementary Likelihood (\( P(E | \neg H) \))
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The probability of the sketch given Adam is not enrolled in this field includes all other fields. Let's assign \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.3 \) for non-specific fields.
- **Computer Science**: Similarly, the likelihood given a random field is moderate. \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now we'll calculate the posterior probabilities, \( P(H | E) \):

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.14}{P(E)}
\]

#### Computer Science:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)}
\]

### Normalizing the Result
To get meaningful values, we must normalize them to a common scale. We'll use the ratio method here, considering the sum of these probabilities as the total.

\[
\text{Total Unnormalized Probability} = 0.14 + 0.04 = 0.18
\]

#### Normalized Posteriors:
\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.18} \approx 0.78
\]
\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.18} \approx 0.22
\]

The final results in the required format are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.78,
  "computer science": 0.22
}
