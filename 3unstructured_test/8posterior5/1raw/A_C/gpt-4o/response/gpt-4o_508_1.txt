To assess the probabilities and apply Bayes' theorem, let's go step-by-step.

First, let's define what each term means in Bayes' rule:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field (agricultural and veterinary science or computer science). 
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in field \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in field \( H \).
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given the personality sketch \( E \).

We will follow these steps for both fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume a general prior probability, \( P(H) \). Graduate fields like agricultural and veterinary sciences are less common compared to broader fields like computer science, so let's utilize \( P(H) = 0.10 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, the likelihood of this personality sketch if he was in agricultural and veterinary science is high. Let's use \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the same personality traits if Adam was not studying agricultural and veterinary science is lower, but since he might still end up in fields with some relatability, let's use \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

4. **Bayes' Rule**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{0.80 \cdot 0.10 + 0.30 \cdot 0.90} \]
\[ = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} \]
\[ = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \]
\[ \approx 0.23 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Computer science is a more common field, so let's assign \( P(H) = 0.30 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: While curious and empathetic skills may be found in computer science students, the traits of nature, plants, and a warm heart are less directly related. Let's propose  \( P(E|H) = 0.40 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the same personality traits if Adam was in any field except computer science. Let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.50 \), as the personality traits might fit better in other fields more aligned with nature.

4. **Bayes' Rule**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | E) = \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.30}{0.40 \cdot 0.30 + 0.50 \cdot 0.70} \]
\[ = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.35} \]
\[ = \frac{0.12}{0.47} \]
\[ \approx 0.26 \]

So, compiling the answers, we get:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.23,
  "computer science": 0.26
}
