To compute P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to assess the priors (P(H)), the likelihoods (P(E|H)), and the complement likelihoods (P(E|¬H)). Here is how you can think about each:

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each field. Without specific data on the distribution of graduate students across fields, we'll assume a relatively uniform distribution. However, computer science tends to have a higher enrollment rate than agricultural and veterinary sciences.

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability that the personality traits described in E would be observed, given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field. Based on the description, Adam's traits seem to align more with agricultural and veterinary science due to his love for nature, plants, and animals. 

3. **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability that the personality traits described in E would be observed, given that Adam is not enrolled in that particular field.

Let's make some reasonable estimations for these probabilities:

- **Computer Science**:
  - P(H_cs): Assuming computer science is popular, let's assign it a prior probability of 0.3.
  - P(E|H_cs): Adam’s traits fit to some extent in computer science due to high intelligence and problem-solving skills, let's estimate 0.2.
  - P(E|¬H_cs): Given the traits are relatively common but less specific to computer science, let's estimate 0.1.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - P(H_ag_vet): Given it's a less common field, let's assign it a prior probability of 0.1.
  - P(E|H_ag_vet): Adam's traits strongly fit this field. Let's estimate 0.8.
  - P(E|¬H_ag_vet): Given the specificity of traits like love for animals and plants, let's estimate 0.05.

Now, computing P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H) \]

For **computer science**:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.3) + (0.1 \times 0.7) = 0.06 + 0.07 = 0.13 \]
\[ P(H_cs|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{0.13} \approx 0.46 \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.05 \times 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.045 = 0.125 \]
\[ P(H_ag_vet|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.125} = 0.64 \]

So the likelihoods based on the personality sketch of Adam:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.46,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64
}
