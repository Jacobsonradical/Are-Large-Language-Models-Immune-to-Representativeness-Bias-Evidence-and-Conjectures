To apply Bayes' rule, we need to first assess the relevant probabilities for each field: agricultural and veterinary science, and computer science. 

Bayes' formula is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) is the same for both fields when comparing them, it cancels out when comparing the relative probabilities, so we only need to consider \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) to get proportional values. These values will then be normalized for comparison. 

Let's break this down for each hypothesis:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that there are numerous disciplines, let's assume a modest base rate (e.g., 5%).

2. **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy fits well with this field. So, let's assign this a high value (e.g., 0.8).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: Likelihood of observing his personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science but in any other field. Since many other fields don't align as closely with his interests (e.g., computer science), let's assign a moderate value (e.g., 0.3).

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given the high popularity of computer science among graduate students, let's assume a high base rate (e.g., 15%).

2. **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science. While computer science students can be intelligent and enjoy solving puzzles, Adam's strong interest in nature and animals isn't aligned. So, let's assign a lower value (e.g., 0.2).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: Likelihood of observing his personality sketch given that he is not in computer science but in any other field. This is the complement and would be similar to the value assigned earlier for agricultural and veterinary science (e.g., 0.3).

Now, let's use the simplified form of Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Calculating the raw values:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.15 = 0.03 \]

So, normalizing:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.03} \approx 0.57 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Computer Science}} = \frac{0.03}{0.04 + 0.03} \approx 0.43 \]

Therefore, based on proportional reasoning:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57,
  "computer science": 0.43
}
