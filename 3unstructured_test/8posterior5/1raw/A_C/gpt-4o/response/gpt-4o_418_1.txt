To determine the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to first establish our approximate assessments for the prior \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the complementary likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then we can calculate the posterior probabilities as follows for each field of graduate study:

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since \( P(H) + P(\neg H) = 1 \), we can reformulate Bayes' theorem accordingly.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Considering Adam’s traits:
- Strong empathy and deep love for animals align well with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- High intelligence and curiosity about nature also make this field plausible.
  
Therefore, our approximate assessments could be:
- \( P(H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science might be 0.05 (considering many possible graduate fields, this is a small but reasonable prior probability).
- \( P(E|H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science might be 0.7 (E aligns strongly with H).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science might be 0.1 (personality traits can fit in other fields too).

### Computer Science
Considering Adam’s traits:
- High intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit well.
- Curiosity about nature and empathy are less typical for the field but still possible.

Thus, our approximate assessments could be:
- \( P(H) \) for Computer Science might be 0.1 (a bit higher than Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to prevalence).
- \( P(E|H) \) for Computer Science might be 0.3 (traits align moderately well).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) for Computer Science might be 0.1.

### Calculations
Let’s calculate \( P(H|E) \) for both fields.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \)

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.035 + 0.095 = 0.13 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.13} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.269 \]

#### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \)

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.1) + (0.1 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.09 = 0.12 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.12} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the estimated posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.269,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

These values indicate the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in these specific fields of graduate study, given his personality sketch E.
