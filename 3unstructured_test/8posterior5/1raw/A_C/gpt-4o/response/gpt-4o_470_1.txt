Sure, let's use the provided information to calculate the probabilities.

Let's break down the values as requested:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- P(H): This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it to be somewhat likely given his curiosity about nature and love for animals. Suppose P(H) = 0.2.
- P(E|H): This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch (E) is true given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interests and traits, this is quite high. Suppose P(E|H) = 0.8.
- P(E|¬H): This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch (E) is true given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. While these traits can fit other fields, they fit less perfectly. Suppose P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
We know:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

 So:
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.16 + 0.24 = 0.4 \]

Now:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = \frac{0.16}{0.4} = 0.4 \]

### Computer Science:
- P(H): This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. Given his intelligence and puzzling-solving nature, this is also reasonable. Suppose P(H) = 0.2.
- P(E|H): This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch (E) is true given that he is enrolled in computer science. This value is moderately high due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills. Suppose P(E|H) = 0.6.
- P(E|¬H): This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch (E) is true given that he is not enrolled in computer science. As before, these traits can fit other fields. Suppose P(E|¬H) = 0.35.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We know:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

So:
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.35 \cdot 0.8 = 0.12 + 0.28 = 0.4 \]

Now:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = \frac{0.12}{0.4} = 0.3 \]

Therefore, the calculations are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

I hope this helps! Note that these calculations are based on assumed prior probabilities and conditional probabilities. The actual values can vary based on additional context or data.
