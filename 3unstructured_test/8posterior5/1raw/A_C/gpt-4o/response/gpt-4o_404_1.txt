Let's evaluate the likelihoods and probabilities for both hypotheses using the information provided in Adam's personality sketch (E).

1. **Computer Science**

    - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given no additional information about the likelihood of fields chosen by students, assume a moderate prior. Let's say P(H) ≈ 0.3.

    - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is studying computer science. Adam's characteristics do not strongly align with common traits of a computer science student (e.g., curiosity about nature, love for animals). So let's assign a lower probability, say P(E|H) ≈ 0.1.

    - **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is studying a field other than computer science. Since the description seems more aligned with other fields (e.g., agricultural and veterinary science), let's assign it a moderately high value, say P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.7.

    Applying Bayes' Rule:
    
    - \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
    - Since we are dealing only with two hypotheses, P(E) ≈ \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \)
    - P(E) ≈ \( 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.7 \cdot 0.7 \)
    - P(E) ≈ \( 0.03 + 0.49 = 0.52 \)
    - So, \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.52} \)
    - P(H|E) ≈ 0.0577

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

    - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Assume a moderate prior. Let's say P(H) ≈ 0.2.

    - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's characteristics strongly align with this field's typical traits. So let's assign a high probability, say P(E|H) ≈ 0.8.

    - **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is studying a field other than agricultural and veterinary science. Given that this personality sketch fits very well with agricultural and veterinary sciences, let's assign a lower probability, say P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.2.

    Applying Bayes' Rule:
    
    - \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
    - Similarly for total probability P(E):
    - P(E) ≈ \( 0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8 \)
    - P(E) ≈ \( 0.16 + 0.16 = 0.32 \)
    - So, \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.32} \)
    - P(H|E) ≈ 0.5

Therefore, based on the Bayes theorem calculations, the computed probabilities are as follows:

  "computer science": 0.0577,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
