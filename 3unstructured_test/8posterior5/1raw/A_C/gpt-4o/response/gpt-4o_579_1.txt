To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, let's start by determining reasonable values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E| \neg H) \).

### 1. Computer Science
- **P(H):** Probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
  - Given the popularity of computer science, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H):** Probability of observing the characteristics in the personality sketch given that Adam is in computer science.
  - Computer science students can have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, but other traits like a deep love for animals and strong empathy might be less correlated. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

- **P(E| \neg H):** Probability of observing the characteristics in the personality sketch given that Adam is not in computer science.
  - Nature curiosity, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work could be more likely in non-computer science fields, but let's keep it a bit broad and assume \( P(E| \neg H) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.4} = \frac{0.06}{0.46} \approx 0.13
\]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** Probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - This field is less common than computer science, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

- **P(E|H):** Probability of observing the characteristics in the personality sketch given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and hard work align very well with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

- **P(E| \neg H):** Probability of observing the characteristics in the personality sketch given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. 
  - As before, assume it is around \( P(E| \neg H) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.95}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.475} = \frac{0.04}{0.515} \approx 0.078
\]

Based on these calculations, here are the probabilities:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.13,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.078
}
```
