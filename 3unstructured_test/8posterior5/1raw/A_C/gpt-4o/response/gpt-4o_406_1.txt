Let's break down the problem using Bayes' theorem, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch, considering all fields.

We'll need to estimate these probabilities for each field.

Starting with "Computer Science":

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability of being a Computer Science graduate student:
   Since computer science is a popular field, let's assume   
   \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.1 \). 

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam's personality sketch if he were a Computer Science student:
   Given Adam has traits like intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, this is moderately likely, let's assume  
   \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.5 \).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of Adam's personality sketch if he is not a Computer Science student:
   Since the traits can fit other fields, especially those requiring intelligence, let's assume   
   \( P(E|¬H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \).

4. **P(E)**: Overall probability of Adam's personality sketch:
   \( P(E) \approx 0.1 \) can be an aggregate estimate for a random graduate student.

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.1}{0.1} = 0.5 \]

For "Agricultural and Veterinary Science":

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability of being an Agricultural and Veterinary Science graduate student:
   Let's assume less common than Computer Science, say  
   \( P(H_{AgVet}) \approx 0.05 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam's personality sketch if he were an Agricultural and Veterinary Science student:
   Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature, this is very likely, so assume  
   \( P(E|H_{AgVet}) \approx 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of Adam's personality sketch if he is not an Agricultural and Veterinary Science student:
   Since these traits fit agricultural science well and less so with another fields, let's assume  
   \( P(E|¬H_{AgVet}) \approx 0.2 \).

4. **P(E)**: Overall probability of Adam's personality sketch:
   \( P(E) \approx 0.1 \).

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{AgVet}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.05 }{0.1} = 0.4 \]

Hence the final answers are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
```
