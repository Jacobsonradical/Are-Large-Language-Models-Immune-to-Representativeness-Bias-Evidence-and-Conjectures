Let's denote the terms and walk through the calculations step by step for each field using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Fields and Their Probabilities

1. **Computer Science**
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)
These are the initial probabilities that Adam is enrolled in each field before considering the personality sketch \( E \).

Given no specific prior information about Adam's field, we will assume equal prior probabilities for simplicity. Since there are numerous fields, we'll assume:

\[ P(\text{computer\_science}) = 0.1 \] (adjust as appropriate for more specific priors)
\[ P(\text{agricultural\_and\_veterinary\_science}) = 0.1 \]

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)
This is the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is enrolled in each specific field.

- **Computer Science \( P(E|\text{computer\_science}) \)**
  - Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts (which fits computer science well).
  - However, his love for nature, animals, and a warm heart might be less common in this field.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\text{computer\_science}) = 0.2 \).

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science \( P(E|\text{agricultural\_and\_veterinary\_science}) \)**
  - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, which perfectly aligns with this field.
  - Empathy and appreciation for hard work fit well too.
  - Let's assume \( P(E|\text{agricultural\_and\_veterinary\_science}) = 0.8 \).

### Complementary Likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \)
This is the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not enrolled in the specific field (considering all other fields).

Given no specific prior data on other fields:

- Assume \( P(E|\neg \text{computer\_science}) = 0.6 \)
- Assume \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural\_and\_veterinary\_science}) = 0.3 \)

### Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \)
Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) for each field can be computed.

For simplicity, assume \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given \( P(\neg H) \approx 0.9 \):

- For **Computer Science**:
  \[ P(E)_{\text{computer\_science}} = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.54 = 0.56 \]
  \[ P(\text{computer\_science}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.56} \approx 0.0357 \]

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[ P(E)_{\text{agricultural\_and\_veterinary\_science}} = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]
  \[ P(\text{agricultural\_and\_veterinary\_science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \approx 0.2286 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:
