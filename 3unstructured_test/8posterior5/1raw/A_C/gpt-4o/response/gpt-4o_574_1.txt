To calculate the probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch (E), we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is constant for both fields, we can compare \( P(H|E) \) values between the fields without needing its actual value. Thus, we will focus on estimating \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. \( P(H) \): The probability that Adam, as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low. Let's assume it is around 0.05 given the number of graduate students and diversity of fields.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals), this field seems highly compatible. So, let's assume this probability is high, around 0.8.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of having a similar personality but not being in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively higher due to more opportunities in other fields, say around 0.2.

### Computer Science
1. \( P(H) \): The probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science is relatively higher due to its popularity. Let's assume it is around 0.2.
2. \( P(E|H) \): While some traits like high intelligence and solving puzzles fit, his love for nature and animals makes it less compatible. So, let's assume this probability is moderate, around 0.3.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of possessing such a personality and not being in computer science is relatively higher, let's say around 0.6.

Now, using Bayes' rule relative to the constant \( P(E) \), the comparison becomes:

### Calculations
For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

### Normalization
Since we compare two fields, normalization isn't required for direct comparison, but the relative probabilities indicate a higher chance for each respective field for Adam.

Here's the final estimate in the asked format:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.06
}
```

This implies that, given the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be in computer science over agricultural and veterinary science, though not by a significant margin.
