Sure, I'll provide a Bayesian analysis based on the given details.

First, let's break down Bayes' rule, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H_{Agri}) \): This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals, let's assume this matches well, so we might give it a relatively higher prior probability, say 0.2.
  
- \( P(E|H_{Agri}) \): This is the probability that Adam's personality traits match if he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his attributes, this could be high, around 0.8.
  
- \( P(E|\neg H_{Agri}) \): This is the probability of Adam's personality traits given any field other than agricultural and veterinary science. As all fields are considered, this might be lower, let's say 0.4.

So,

\[ P(H_{Agri}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science

- \( P(H_{CS}) \): This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Given the broad diversity of people in computer science fields and his high intelligence, let's give it a moderate prior probability, say 0.15.
  
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): This is the probability that Adam's traits match if he is in computer science. Given his affinity for puzzles and abstract concepts, this might be moderate, around 0.6.
  
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): Again, this is similar to other fields, with a probability of around 0.4.

So,

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Now, we can roughly estimate \( P(E) \) as being influenced significantly by fields related to Adam's interests and traits, but we will keep it as a normalization factor here.

Calculating these values in a relative sense:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H_{Agri}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.16}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

While the precise numerical values will require proper normalization, the relative probabilities suggest that Adam is more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science based on his personality sketch.

Therefore, the relative likelihoods might look something like this:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64,
  "computer science": 0.36
}

These values are obviously approximations for relative comparison, not absolute probabilities. The key takeaway is that, based on the provided personality sketch, Adam appears to have a higher likelihood of being in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
