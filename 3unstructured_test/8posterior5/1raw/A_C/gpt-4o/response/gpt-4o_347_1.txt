Certainly. Let's assess the probability for each field based on the information provided.

### Step 1: Determine Probabilities for Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)

1. **P(H1) - Probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science:** 
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, it seems moderately likely. Let's assume a moderate probability, say 0.2.

2. **P(E|H1) - Probability of observing the personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - Considering Adam matches well with someone who would be in an agricultural and veterinary science field (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy), let's assume a high probability, say 0.9.

3. **P(E|¬H1) - Probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - Given that these traits could still apply to several other fields, we assume non-enrollment with moderate chances, say 0.1.

Using Bayes' Theorem for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[
  P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \times P(H1)}{P(E)}
  \]

Since total probabilities can be complex to calculate exactly without more data, let's simplify and set P(E) for normalization later.

### Step 2: Determine Probabilities for Computer Science (H2)

1. **P(H2) - Probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science:** 
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, which are fitting traits for someone in computer science. Let's assign a moderate-to-high probability here, say 0.3.

2. **P(E|H2) - Probability of observing the personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science:**
   - While some traits align (puzzle-solving, intelligence), others (curiosity about nature, love for animals) do not fit perfectly. Assume a moderate probability, say 0.4.

3. **P(E|¬H2) - Probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not enrolled in computer science:**
   - Given that there are many other fields where his traits might fit, we assume a moderate probability, say 0.4.

Using Bayes' Theorem for Computer Science:
  \[
  P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \times P(H2)}{P(E)}
  \]

### Calculation (values are proportional, so normalization may be skipped for simplicity):

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**:
  \[
  P(H1|E) \propto P(E|H1) \times P(H1) = 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18
  \]

For **Computer Science (H2)**:
  \[
  P(H2|E) \propto P(E|H2) \times P(H2) = 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12
  \]

### Normalizing (optional)

Sum of the unnormalized probabilities: \(0.18 + 0.12 = 0.3\)

Normalized probabilities:
  \[
  P(H1|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.3} = 0.6
  \]
  \[
  P(H2|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.3} = 0.4
  \]

### Final Answer:
```
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```
