Sure, let's break down the analysis for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering the number of graduate students in various fields (including agricultural and veterinary science), this prior might be relatively low but notable as it's not an uncommon field. Let's assume P(H) = 0.1 (10%).
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, this fits very well. P(E|H) would likely be high. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.8 (80%).
   - **P(E|¬H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is **not** enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering the general nature of his traits, this might still be somewhat likely but not as high as P(E|H). Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3077 \] (approx. 31%)

2. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. Computer science is a very popular field among graduate students. Let's assume P(H) = 0.2 (20%).
   - **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science. While some of his traits like high intelligence and enjoying puzzles might fit, aspects like his love for nature, plants, and animals might not fit as well. Therefore, let's assume P(E|H) = 0.3 (30%).
   - **P(E|¬H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is **not** enrolled in computer science. Similar to the overall nature of his traits and considering other possible fields, let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.4 (40%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.32 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.38 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1579 \] (approx. 16%)

Thus, the results are as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.3077",  // 31%
  "computer science": "0.1579"  // 16%
}
