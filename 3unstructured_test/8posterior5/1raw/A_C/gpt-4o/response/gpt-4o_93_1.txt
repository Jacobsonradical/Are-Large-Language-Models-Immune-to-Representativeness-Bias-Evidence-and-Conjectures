To compute \( P(H|E) \), we will use Bayes' Theorem, which is expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \), which can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's first estimate each value required for the fields "agricultural and veterinary science" and "computer science":

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability of the hypothesis.
2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of observing the evidence given not the hypothesis.

Considering Adam's personality sketch:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: This represents the likelihood that any given graduate student is in this field. Graduate programs in agricultural and veterinary sciences are somewhat common, so we might estimate this at about \( 0.1 \).
  
- **P(E|H)**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, a strong empathy for animals, and a warm heart, which aligns well with the qualities needed in this field. Hence, this probability is quite high, let's estimate \( 0.8 \).
  
- **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam were not in agricultural and veterinary science, we might see these traits in other fields, but less likely to such an extent. Let’s estimate \( 0.2 \).

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The likelihood that any given graduate student is in this field; computer science is a popular field. We might estimate this at about \( 0.15 \).
  
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles can align with the qualities needed in computer science, but his deep love for nature and animals is less aligned. Therefore, let’s estimate \( 0.4 \).
  
- **P(E|\neg H)**: If Adam were not in computer science, trying to fit his traits to other fields (including his deep empathy and love for nature and animals), let's estimate \( 0.3 \).

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

where \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \).

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 \]

Hence,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.15) + (0.3 \times 0.85) = 0.06 + 0.255 = 0.315 \]

Hence,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{0.315} \approx 0.1905 \]

So, the results are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.3077",
  "computer science": "0.1905"
}
