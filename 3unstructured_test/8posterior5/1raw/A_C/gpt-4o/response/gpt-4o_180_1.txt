To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Theorem, we need to know the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

To simplify and focus on the relative probabilities, we need to compare \( P(H|E) \) for different hypotheses. Here are the estimates for the required probabilities:

### For Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science might be moderate.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he was enrolled in Computer Science might be relatively low, since his strong affinity for animals and nature isn't a typical trait associated with Computer Science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering the proportion of students in the U.S. enrolled in fields other than Computer Science, this value would be moderate.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science might be lower when considering the overall number of students enrolled in these fields.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is high, given his love for nature and animals.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that there are many other fields that don’t align with his personality traits, this value might be moderate to low.

Combining these:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We can reasonably assume that the probabilities \( P(E) \) would normalize the results, so for simplicity in relative comparison, we might consider:

- For Computer Science: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \), \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \), \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

Calculating the probabilities:

- \( P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \)
- \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \)

Normalizing these to relative values:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.08} \approx 0.429 \]
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.06 + 0.08} \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:
