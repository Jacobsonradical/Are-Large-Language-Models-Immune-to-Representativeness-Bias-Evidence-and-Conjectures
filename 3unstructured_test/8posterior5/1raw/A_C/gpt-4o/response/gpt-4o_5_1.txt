To determine the probability \( P(H|E) \) for each graduate field, we apply Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

We need to consider the following probabilities for each field:

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of someone being in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of exhibiting Adam's personality traits given the field of study.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of exhibiting Adam's personality traits given any other field of study.
- \( P(E) \): Total probability of exhibiting Adam's personality traits, which can be expressed as \( P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \). For simplicity, we can focus on the relative comparisons among different fields and assume some common factors are roughly equivalent for simplification.

Given the personality traits of Adam (curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence), it's more likely that these characteristics would align more closely with a field associated with natural sciences or animal care than with a purely technical field.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H)_{\text{CS}} \): The baseline probability that any given graduate student is in computer science might be relatively high due to its popularity.
   - \( P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} = \text{low} \): The personality traits are not strongly aligned with common traits for computer science grads.
   - \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{CS}} = \text{mixed} \): The probability of these traits given another field is dependent on the specific fields that are common.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H)_{\text{AVS}} \): Lower baseline probability compared to CS due to fewer students, but specialized interests.
   - \( P(E|H)_{\text{AVS}} = \text{high} \): The personality traits strongly align with typical interests in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{AVS}} = \text{mixed} \): The probability of these traits given another field is much more variable.

### Bayesian Analysis:
With the general trend of Adam's traits fitting better with agricultural and veterinary sciences, we would assign probabilities reflecting this alignment.

**Assumptions**:
- \( P(H)_{\text{CS}} \approx 0.3 \): Popular graduate field like computer science.
- \( P(H)_{\text{AVS}} \approx 0.1 \): Less common, more specialized field.

With estimated conditional probabilities:
- \( P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \approx 0.2 \): Lower match of traits.
- \( P(E|H)_{\text{AVS}} \approx 0.7 \): Higher match of traits.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is relatively smaller for AVS-suited traits compared to CS-suited ones, but for non-specific purposes, it can be approximated as lower for CS traits (\( \approx 0.3 \)) and higher for AVS traits (\( \approx 0.6 \)).

Now computing using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting values:

1. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \propto (0.2) \times (0.3) = 0.06
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{AVS}} \propto (0.7) \times (0.1) = 0.07
   \]

Normalized probably by dividing by total if necessary:
- For normalized probability,
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{total}} = 0.06 + 0.07 = 0.13 \]
- Thus relative probabilities:

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.06}{0.13} \approx 0.46 
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{AVS}} = \frac{0.07}{0.13} \approx 0.54 
\]

Hence, we deduce:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.46,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.54
}
```

Note: Relative magnitude is proportional, not absolute probabilities adding up to 1.
