Let's break it down systematically using Bayes' rule. Recall that Bayes' theorem is \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), where \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, and \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

We will assume general prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) for these fields and make educated guesses on the likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \)). Here are step-by-step calculations:

### For Computer Science:

- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:
  Let's take an approximate value for the probability that a graduate student is in computer science. Considering the variety of graduate programs, we might estimate this as relatively common but not dominant. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
  Given Adam's characteristics (e.g., high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts), there's a reasonable fit for computer science, but it's not a perfect fit since his deep love for nature and animals is less aligned. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
  Considering all other fields (excluding computer science), an average graduate student fitting the description of having a love for nature, animals, empathy, etc., we might estimate this value to be somewhat average. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.15 \cdot 0.9 = 0.03 + 0.135 = 0.165 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.165} \approx 0.182 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:
  Let's take an approximate value for the probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This is less common than computer science. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
  Given Adam's specific interest in nature, plants, and animals, there's a strong match. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

- **Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
  Considering all other fields (excluding agricultural and veterinary science), an average graduate student fitting the description might not be as common. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95 = 0.035 + 0.095 = 0.130 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.130} \approx 0.269 \]

Summarizing:

{
  "computer science": 0.182,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.269
}

These values provide the posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch.
