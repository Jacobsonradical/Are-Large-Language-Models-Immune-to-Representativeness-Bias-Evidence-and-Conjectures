To answer this question, we first need an understanding of the probabilities in question:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field (given no additional information).
2. P(E|H): The probability of observing the evidence E, given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing the evidence E, given that Adam is NOT enrolled in that field.
4. P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in that specific field, given the evidence E.

Now, let's break it down for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the number of graduate fields, let's assume this could be arbitrarily small since he could be in many fields. Let's say P(H) = 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the traits described in E if he is in agricultural and veterinary science is quite high because those traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and hard work) align well with this field. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having these traits if he is NOT in agricultural and veterinary science is somewhat lower but not insignificant. These traits are also present in other fields. Let's estimate P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.229 \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is in computer science. Given the number of graduate fields, let's assume this could also be small. Let's say P(H) = 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the traits described in E if he is in computer science is lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science. While being quiet, good at solving puzzles, and high intelligence fit, curiosity about nature and love for animals and empathy don't align strongly. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having these traits if he is NOT in computer science might be a bit higher compared to agriculture because those traits might align more closely with various other fields. Let's say P(E|\neg H) = 0.37.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.37 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.333 = 0.373 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.373} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.107 \]

Now, let's present the answers in the required format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "computer science": 0.107
