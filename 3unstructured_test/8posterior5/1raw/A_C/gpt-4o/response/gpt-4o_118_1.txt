Sure, let's approach this step by step using Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we'll need to estimate three values:
1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability of enrolling in the field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch given enrollment in the field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of having Adam's personality sketch given enrollment in any other field.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: Generally, computer science is a popular field among graduate students, but let's suppose the prior probability (\(P(H)\)) is about 0.2.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's characteristics, it seems plausible but less likely he would be in computer science. His love for nature and animals, as well as his empathy, doesn't strongly align with typical traits for this field. Let's estimate this as 0.1.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of having Adam's traits if he is in any other field. Given his traits align better with several other fields, this might be slightly higher, say, 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

We don't have the exact \(P(E)\), but we can represent our outcome in relative terms without it. Let's express this in an intermediate form where \( P(H|E_{\text{CS}}) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: This is a less common field, but let's estimate the prior probability (\(P(H)\)) is about 0.05.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, the probability aligns well. Let's estimate this as 0.8.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of having Adam's traits if he is in any other field. Given his traits, this might be lower for other fields collectively except this one. Let's say this is about 0.4:

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E_{\text{AVS}}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Likewise, without the exact value of \(P(E)\), we can express this as \( P(H|E_{\text{AVS}}) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \).

Now, to provide the final values normalized such that they give probabilities for "Agricultural and Veterinary Science" and "Computer Science" relative to each other:

\[
\frac{P(H|E_{\text{CS}})}{P(H|E_{\text{AVS}})} = \frac{0.02}{0.04} = 0.5
\]

Thus, we need a ratio to represent this:

\[
P(H|E_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.04} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33
\]

\[
P(H|E_{\text{AVS}}) = \frac{0.04}{0.02 + 0.04} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67
\]

So we get:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67
}
