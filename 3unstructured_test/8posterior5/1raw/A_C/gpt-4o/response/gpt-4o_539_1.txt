Let's start by assessing the probabilities for each field based on the personality sketch of Adam.

**Field: agricultural and veterinary science**
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam enrolling in this field. Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, and his high empathy, it's reasonable to estimate this as relatively high.
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.2
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interests, this probability should be high.
   \[
   P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.9
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that there are many fields he could be enrolled in, but not all of them would have the same alignment with his personality, this should be lower.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.3
   \]

4. **P(H|E)**: Using Bayes' rule to update our belief about Adam's field of study given his personality sketch.
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} 
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \approx 0.4286
   \]

**Field: computer science**
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam enrolling in this field. Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence with a good grasp of abstract concepts, this field is also a reasonable possibility.
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science. Given his intelligence and problem-solving skills, it is plausible, although his interest in plants and animals does not strongly align with computer science.
   \[
   P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.5
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in computer science. Again, considering all other possible fields, this should be moderate.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4
   \]

4. **P(H|E)**: Using Bayes' rule to determine the probability of Adam studying computer science given his personality sketch.
   \[
   P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8} \approx 0.1429
   \]

Therefore, our estimates for the probability that Adam is enrolled in each field, given his personality sketch, are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4286,
  "computer science": 0.1429
}
