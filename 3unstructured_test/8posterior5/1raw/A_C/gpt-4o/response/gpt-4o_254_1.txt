To determine \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \)**, the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**, the likelihood that the personality sketch \( E \) corresponds to each field.
3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)**, the likelihood that the personality sketch \( E \) corresponds to any field other than the hypothesized field.
4. Use Bayes' theorem: 
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing \( E \), which can be found using \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Given the limited data, we have to make some assumptions:

1. Let's assume that the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in any field is uniform initially (i.e., before considering \( E \)).
2. \( P(E|\neg H) \) should consider the overall likelihood of personality traits \( E \) aligning with fields other than the given hypothesized field.

We start with some rough estimates based on the personality sketch and field characteristics.

### Computer Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: We assume the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science is 0.1 (10%), since it's a common field.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and love for solving puzzles, there's a reasonable match, so we'll put it at 0.3 (30%).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: If not in Computer Science, Adam's traits could somewhat align with many other fields, though not perfectly, so let’s assume 0.1 (10%).

Using Bayes' theorem for Computer Science:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
\]

We need to calculate \( P(E) \):

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.1 \cdot 0.9 = 0.03 + 0.09 = 0.12
\]

So,

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.12} = 0.25
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(H) \)**: We assume the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is 0.05 (5%), as fewer students enroll comparatively.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given his love of nature and animals, this field fits well, so we set it at 0.6 (60%).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: If not in this field, Adam fits other fields less well, let’s assume 0.1 (10%).

Using Bayes' theorem for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
\]

Calculate \( P(E) \):

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.6 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95 = 0.03 + 0.095 = 0.125
\]

So,

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.125} = 0.24
\]
