To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to make some assumptions about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Here’s how we can approach it qualitatively for the two fields based on Adam's personality sketch:

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)
- \( P(H) \) for different fields could be influenced by the overall popularity of the fields among graduate students. Let’s assume:
  - \( P(\text{computer science}) \): moderate popularity.
  - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): less popular compared to computer science.

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- \( P(E|H) \) describes how likely Adam’s qualities are given that he is in that field.
  - For **computer science**:
    - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts fit well.
    - Curiosity about nature and love for animals don't strongly fit.
    - Empathy and appreciation for hard work may or may not fit.
    - Thus, we might assign a moderate likelihood \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \).

  - For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
    - Genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align well.
    - His intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles are not exclusive to this field but still relevant.
    - Thus, we might assign a high likelihood \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality traits given that Adam is not in a specific field. This is an average over all other possible fields, which could be tricky. We might assume:
  - Moderate likelihood for \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \) based on general applicability.
  - Lower likelihood for \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) since those traits might be less common in other fields.

With these qualitative assessments, let’s assume some reasonable numbers:

### Assumptions
- For computer science:
  - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)
  - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.5 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.4 \)

### Bayes' Rule Computation
Using the formula \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \) and estimating \( P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

#### For Computer Science
\[ P(E) \approx (0.5 \times 0.3) + (0.3 \times 0.7) = 0.15 + 0.21 = 0.36 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{0.36} = \frac{0.15}{0.36} \approx 0.4167 \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.4 \times 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.36 = 0.44 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.44} = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \approx 0.1818 \]
