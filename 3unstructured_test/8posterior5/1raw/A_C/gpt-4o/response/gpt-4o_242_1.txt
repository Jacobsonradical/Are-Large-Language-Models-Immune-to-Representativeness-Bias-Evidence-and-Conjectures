To solve this, we will utilize Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to establish the following probabilities for each hypothesis \(H\):

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing the evidence \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood of observing the evidence \(E\) given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.

Since we aren't given specific values, we'll need to make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H for agricultural and veterinary science)**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it seems quite reasonable that he could be enrolled in this field. Let’s hypothesize:
   \[
   P(H)_{agr} = 0.4
   \]

2. **P(E|H for agricultural and veterinary science)**: The description fits well with this field, so:
   \[
   P(E|H)_{agr} = 0.8
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H for agricultural and veterinary science)**: Considering Adam's description doesn’t strongly exclude other fields, we can assume a moderate probability that such characteristics might still be present in students of other fields:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H)_{agr} = 0.4
   \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H for computer science)**: Adam's high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles could suggest an aptitude for computer science, though it’s not the primary match given his other traits. Let’s hypothesize:
   \[
   P(H)_{cs} = 0.3
   \]

2. **P(E|H for computer science)**: Parts of the descriptions (intelligence and puzzle-solving) fit well with computer science, but the love for animals and nature doesn’t align as closely:
   \[
   P(E|H)_{cs} = 0.4
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H for computer science)**: The overall characteristics can be somewhat common among non-computer science students too:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H)_{cs} = 0.5
   \]

Now let's calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem. We do not know \(P(E)\), but since the same evidence applies to all fields, it’s a common factor and will not change the relative probabilities:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H|E)_{agr} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} \]

#### For Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \(P(E)\) is a constant (for comparison purposes, it cancels out), we calculate the normalized posterior probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.4}{k} = 0.32 / k \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{k} = 0.12 / k \]

Combining these relative probabilities:

\[ \text{Sum } = 0.32 / k + 0.12 / k = 0.44 / k \]

For normalization:

\[ P(H|E)_{agr} = \frac{0.32 / k}{0.44 / k} = \frac{0.32}{0.44} = 0.727 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.12 / k}{0.44 / k} = \frac{0.12}{0.44} = 0.273 \]

Presenting in the required format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.727,
  "computer science": 0.273
}
