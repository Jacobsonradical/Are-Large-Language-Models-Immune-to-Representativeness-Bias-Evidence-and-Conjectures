To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood under the alternative \( P(E|\neg H) \). Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and effectively acts as a normalizing constant, we can focus on the numerator for comparing different fields.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Hypothesis (\( H \)): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.**

- **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: This is the overall likelihood that any graduate student is in this field. Let's assume a modest prior based on overall university demographics.
  \( P(H) = 0.1 \)

- **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: Given that Adam has a strong love for animals, nature, and an appreciation for hard work, it's highly likely that he fits well in this field.
  \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)

- **Likelihood under the alternative (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**: This is the likelihood of someone having Adam's characteristics but not being in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that these characteristics can be distributed across many fields, let's assume it is modest.
  \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### For Computer Science

**Hypothesis (\( H \)): Adam was enrolled in computer science.**

- **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: This is the overall likelihood that any graduate student is in this field. Computer science is a highly popular field, so we might assume a higher prior.
  \( P(H) = 0.2 \)

- **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, these traits align well with computer science. However, his other characteristics (love for nature and animals) are less directly related.
  \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \)

- **Likelihood under the alternative (\( P(E|\neg H) \))**: This is the likelihood of someone having Adam's characteristics but not being in computer science. Given that these characteristics are more typical for non-CS fields, let's assume it is also moderate.
  \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]

From these calculations:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
\]

Please note, these values are based on the assumptions made about the priors and likelihoods informed by typical university demographics and the given personality sketch. The absolute values are less important than the relative values when comparing different fields.
