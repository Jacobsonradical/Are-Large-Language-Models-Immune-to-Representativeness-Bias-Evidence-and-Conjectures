To estimate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Since we do not have specific numerical values, I will make reasonable assumptions based on general knowledge to estimate these probabilities.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - Given the popularity of computer science among graduate programs, we might assume that there is a moderate prior probability of Adam being in this field.
   - Estimate: \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in computer science.
   - Curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and a love for animals do not strongly correlate with computer science, though high intelligence and problem-solving skills do somewhat.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in computer science.
   - This is broader, but certain elements like curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals align better with other fields, such as agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - This field is less common than some others, suggesting a lower prior probability, but considering his interest in nature and animals, it might be higher for this particular sketch.
   - Estimate: \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - This sketch fits well with this field due to his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given that these traits do not align as closely with many other fields, this probability is somewhat lower.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \)

Now we use Bayesâ€™ Rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.48 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.54 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.111 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.36 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.43 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.43} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.07}{0.43} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.163 \]

Hence, the results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.163
}
