To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in that field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of observing E given that Adam was not enrolled in that specific field).

Let's make reasonable assumptions given the description of Adam's personality and interests.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** Let's assume the prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. It might be less common than computer science, so let's assume a conservative probability of 0.1.
- **P(E|H):** Adam's curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work fit well with a career in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume a high probability, such as 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality in students not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science might be lower, since appreciation for nature and animals is particularly relevant here. Let's estimate it at 0.3.

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** Computer Science is a popular field among graduate students. Let's assume a higher prior probability of 0.2.
- **P(E|H):** While Adam's love for solving puzzles and high intelligence align well with Computer Science, his deep love for animals and nature might not match as directly. Let's estimate it at 0.4.
- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch in students not in Computer Science might be similar since these characteristics are less domain-specific. Let's estimate it at 0.5.

Next, we calculate the probability of \( E \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Assuming that the remaining probability is evenly spread among various other fields of specialization, and for simplicity let's suppose 
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) - P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.7 \]

Let's simplify the calculations using these rough numbers:

\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.7) = 0.08 + 0.08 + 0.21 = 0.37 \]

Now applying Bayes’ rule:

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.37} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.37} \approx 0.216 \]

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.37} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.37} \approx 0.216 \]

Of course, these are rough estimates and simplifying assumptions have been made.

Here's the final answer:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.216,
