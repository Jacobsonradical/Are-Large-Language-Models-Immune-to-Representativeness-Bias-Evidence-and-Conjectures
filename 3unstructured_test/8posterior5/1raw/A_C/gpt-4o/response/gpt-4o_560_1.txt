To proceed with our calculations, let's denote H₁ to be the hypothesis that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, and H₂ to be the hypothesis that he is enrolled in computer science. We need to estimate the probabilities P(H₁), P(E|H₁), P(E|¬H₁), P(H₂), P(E|H₂), and P(E|¬H₂), and then compute P(H₁|E) and P(H₂|E) using Bayes' Rule.

Let’s assume the following:
- P(H₁) and P(H₂) are prior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in either field before considering the evidence E.
- P(E|H₁) and P(E|H₂) are the likelihoods of observing the evidence given that Adam is in the respective fields.
- P(E|¬H₁) and P(E|¬H₂) are the likelihoods of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in the respective fields.

Quantifying these probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H₁)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science might be relatively low since it’s a specialized field. Let’s estimate it to be 0.1.
- **P(E|H₁)**: The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch if he is in this field is relatively high due to his love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy. Let's estimate this to be 0.7.
- **P(E|¬H₁)**: Let’s assume that students in other fields might exhibit similar characteristics, but with less frequency. So, we might estimate this to be 0.3.

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁)}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science:
- **P(H₂)**: Computer science is a common field for graduate students, so this might be relatively high. Let’s estimate it to be 0.2.
- **P(E|H₂)**: The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch if he is in computer science is moderate. Though his high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit, his love for nature, plants, and animals might not be a strong indicator. Let’s estimate this to be 0.5.
- **P(E|¬H₂)**: Similar to above, let's estimate this to be 0.3.

Using Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we do not have \(P(E)\) directly, we can compare the relative likelihoods for ranking.

### Summary:
Assuming the assumption about \(P(E)\) is consistent across the fields we are comparing, we get:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx 0.07 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \approx 0.10 \)
}

For the sake of comparing probabilities within our problem context, here is the standardization of these probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.41",
  "computer science": "0.59"
}

Keep in mind that P(E) is a constant that cancels out in the ratio calculations, and these results should be normalized if you need to sum across all possible hypotheses explicitly. The actual values provided here are standardized relatively to show the stronger likelihood between the given fields.
