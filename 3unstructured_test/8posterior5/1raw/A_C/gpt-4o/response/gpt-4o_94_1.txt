To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), let's estimate the probabilities for each field.

### **1. Computer Science**

**Hypothesis**: Adam was enrolled in computer science.

- **P(H)** (prior probability of being in computer science): Given the wide range of fields, let's assume a balanced distribution with some bias towards STEM fields. A rough estimate could be around 0.15 (15%).
- **P(E|H)** (likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in computer science): 
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance to computer science.
  - Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: High relevance, typical for computer science students.
  - Love for animals and strong empathy: Not particularly relevant.
  - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: High relevance.
  
  Given these factors, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as approximately 0.4 (40%).

- **P(E|\neg H)** (likelihood of the personality sketch given not being in computer science): 
  - Assuming an average across other fields: There's overlap in being quiet, enjoying puzzles, and high intelligence.
  
  This could be roughly 0.2 (20%).

### **2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

**Hypothesis**: Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

- **P(H)** (prior probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science): Given the overall distribution of fields, a rough estimate could be around 0.05 (5%).
- **P(E|H)** (likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science): 
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Highly relevant.
  - Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: Relevance depends, but some role in research.
  - Love for animals and strong empathy: Highly relevant.
  - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Relevant, although more practical in nature.
  
  Given these factors, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as approximately 0.7 (70%).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: As before, assuming average relevance across fields, let's estimate it at 0.2 (20%).

Now, using Bayes' rule, we compute \( P(H|E) \):

### **For Computer Science:**

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Assuming \( P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.15 \) (since other fields occupy the remaining 85%):

\[ P(E)_{cs} = (0.4 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]

\[ P(E)_{cs} = 0.06 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(E)_{cs} = 0.23 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{0.23} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.23} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{cs} \approx 0.26 \]

### **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(H|E)_{agri} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.05 \):

\[ P(E)_{agri} = (0.7 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.95) \]

\[ P(E)_{agri} = 0.035 + 0.19 \]

\[ P(E)_{agri} = 0.225 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{agri} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.225} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{agri} \approx \frac{0.035}{0.225} \]

\[ P(H|E)_{agri} \approx 0.156 \]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.26,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.156
}
```
