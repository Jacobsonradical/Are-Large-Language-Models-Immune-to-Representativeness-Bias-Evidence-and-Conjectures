To apply Bayes' Rule, we'll go through the following steps:

1. Estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \).
2. Estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) given the personality sketch for each field.
3. Estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \) given the personality sketch for each field.
4. Use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

Where,
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given not hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).

We'll give estimations for each of these values based on the given personality sketch and general knowledge about these fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: 
  The proportion of students studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to all other fields is relatively low.
  Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: 
  Adam's characteristics, such as strong empathy, love for animals, appreciation of hard work, and curiosity about plants, strongly align with this field.
  Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
  Given that Adam's personality sketch could also fit a variety of other fields (besides agricultural and veterinary science), the likelihood should reflect that broad possibility.
  Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Now, using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{(0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.095} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural} = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

### Computer Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: 
  The proportion of students studying computer science is higher than those in agricultural and veterinary science.
  Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: 
  Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which would be beneficial in computer science, although his love for nature and animals does not strongly align with this field.
  Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
  Given that Adam's personality sketch contains aspects fitting other fields more closely than computer science, the likelihood of the sketch if he were not in this field is higher.
  Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Now, using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{(0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.045}{0.215} \approx 0.209 \]

So, the probabilities we obtained are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "computer science": 0.209
}
```
