Given the personality sketch of Adam, let's calculate our estimates for the probabilities and then apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|E) \), the probability of each field given the evidence provided by the personality sketch \( E \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's characteristics like curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy, it is reasonable to assume he fits well in this field. Let's estimate this at \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his traits, it's very likely he would choose this field. Let's estimate this at \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. For fields outside of agriculture and veterinary science, it might be less probable to have these specific traits. Let’s estimate this at \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.30 \).

Apply Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

\[
P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.30 \cdot (1 - 0.15)) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.375} = \frac{0.12}{0.375} \approx 0.32
\]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Given Adam's intelligence and love for puzzles, it is somewhat likely. Let’s estimate this at \( P(H) = 0.20 \).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Traits like high intelligence and problem-solving fit well but traits like love for animals might not. Let’s estimate this at \( P(E|H) = 0.40 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science. For non-computer science fields, it might be less probable to match all traits perfectly. Let’s estimate this at \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.35 \).

Apply Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

\[
P(E) = (0.40 \cdot 0.20) + (0.35 \cdot (1 - 0.20)) = 0.08 + 0.28 = 0.36
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.20}{0.36} = \frac{0.08}{0.36} \approx 0.22
\]

### Final Results

Based on the above calculations, we have:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32,
  "computer science": 0.22
}
