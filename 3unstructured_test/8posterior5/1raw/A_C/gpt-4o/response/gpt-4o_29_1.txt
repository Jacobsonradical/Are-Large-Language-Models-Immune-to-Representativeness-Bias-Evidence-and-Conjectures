To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in computer science or agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a certain field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we only need to consider the relative terms.

### Assumptions:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Given Adam's interests and traits, the likelihood of him being in computer science is fairly low given his strong interest in nature, animals, and puzzles.
- \( P(E|H_{AV}) \): Given Adam's traits, the likelihood of him being in agricultural and veterinary science is quite high due to his love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work.

### Estimations:
- Prior probabilities \( P(H) \) will be based on general graduate enrollment distributions. Let's assume:
  - \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \)
  - \( P(H_{AV}) \approx 0.1 \)

- Likelihoods based on personality sketch:
  - \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|H_{AV}) = 0.7 \)

- General likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) is combined with other fields, let's give a generic value:
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{AV}) = 0.4 \)

### Bayes' Theorem Application:
For \( computer science \):
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is consistent for comparison:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \]

For \( agricultural and veterinary science \):
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

Total for normalization (even though it's not mandatory for comparison):
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.07 = 0.10 \]

Normalized:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.10} = 0.3 \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.10} = 0.7 \]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values indicate the relative probabilities that Adam's personality sketch aligns with either field of study.
