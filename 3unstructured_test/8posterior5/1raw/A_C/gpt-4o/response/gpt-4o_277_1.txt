To estimate the probabilities, we'll consider the given personality traits and how well they align with each field. Then we'll apply Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \).

Let's start with some reasonable estimates of the prior probabilities, conditional probabilities, and the steps for applying Bayes' rule.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. It's a fairly common field for someone with an interest in nature and animals, but not overwhelmingly so. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5%).

**P(E|H):** The probability of observing E given that Adam is in this field. Given his traits (love for nature, animals, empathy), they fit very well with this field. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (80%).

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing E given that Adam is not in this field. Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) could still occur if he were in other fields, though perhaps to a lesser degree. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
= (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23
\]

So:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.1739
\]

### Computer Science

**P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Computer science is a popular graduate field, and given Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, it's fairly plausible. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15%).

**P(E|H):** The probability of observing E given that Adam is in this field. While computer science doesn't clearly align with his love for nature and animals, his intelligence and ability to solve puzzles fit. Let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \) (40%).

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing E given that Adam is not in this field. Given that his traits could fit various other fields more naturally, let's keep \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
= (0.4 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.06 + 0.17 = 0.23
\]

So:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.23} \approx 0.2609
\]
