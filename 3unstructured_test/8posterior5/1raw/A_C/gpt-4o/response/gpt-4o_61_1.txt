To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to consider three probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence (E) given that Adam is in the field (H).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence (E) given that Adam is not in the field (H).

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming we don't have specific data about the distribution of graduate students in various fields, we'll make some educated guesses based on the information given.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H):** The probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it seems reasonably likely but not overly common.
Let's assume \( P(H) \) = 0.2 (20%).

**P(E|H):** The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is in this field.
Given that this field strongly aligns with Adam's traits, let's assume a high value. \( P(E|H) \) = 0.9 (90%).

**P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is not in this field.
Since his traits could align with a few other fields as well, but less strongly, we assume a moderate likelihood.
Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.4 (40%).

### Computer Science

**P(H):** The probability that Adam is in computer science.
Given Adam's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, this seems a reasonable field, but let's guess it's less likely than the first.
Let's assume \( P(H) \) = 0.15 (15%).

**P(E|H):** The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is in this field.
Given that some traits fit well but not perfectly (not much mention of nature or animals), let's assume \( P(E|H) \) = 0.5 (50%).

**P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is not in this field.
Same reasoning as above: Adam could fit into several other fields.
Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.4 (40%).

### Computing Posterior Probabilities

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We don't have specific data for \( P(E) \), but we'll assume it is the same for both hypotheses for the sake of relative comparison. Therefore, we donâ€™t need to calculate the exact value, only the numerator, which can serve as a relative indicator.

### Calculation:

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18 \]

For computer science:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.15 = 0.075 \]

### Normalizing

To make it clearer, we'll normalize these probabilities:
- Sum = 0.18 + 0.075 = 0.255

Now, the normalized values:

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ \frac{0.18}{0.255} \approx 0.71 \]

For computer science:

\[ \frac{0.075}{0.255} \approx 0.29 \]

### Final Answer

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.71",
  "computer science": "0.29"
}
