To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to determine the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is the normalization term but is not needed to compute relative probabilities, as we can compare the numerators directly.

Assumptions for the calculation:

- Adam's personality profile fits well with subjects related to nature, empathy towards animals, and abstract thinking.
- It fits less well with fields that are purely technical or do not involve nature and animals.

Let's use these guidelines to assign the probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Assuming this field is not the most common but fairly relevant to people with Adam's interests, let's set \( P(H) \) around 0.15.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits match well; thus, we could set this quite high; let's say 0.85.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming other fields would not match Adam's profile as well, we might set this at 0.2.

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a common graduate field, so we might assign \( P(H) \) around 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): While his intelligence and interest in puzzles fit, there is not much connection to nature or animals; let's set this at 0.5.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming the other fields would not match Adam's personality as well; let's set this somewhat lower, say 0.3.

### Calculation

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.85 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since we only need relative values, we can compare just the numerators:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ 0.85 \times 0.15 = 0.1275 \]

- Computer Science:
\[ 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.10 \]

Therefore, the relative values are:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri\_vet}} = 0.1275 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = 0.1 \]

So the computed relative probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1275,
  "computer science": 0.1
}
```

These values are relative and indicate that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than computer science based on his personality sketch, but for exact probabilities, further normalization would be needed considering all possible fields.
