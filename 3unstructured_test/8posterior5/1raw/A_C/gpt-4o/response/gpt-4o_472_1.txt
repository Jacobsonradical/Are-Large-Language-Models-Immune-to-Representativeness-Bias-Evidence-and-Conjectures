To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields "agricultural and veterinary science" and "computer science", we start by estimating the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the probabilities \( P(E|\neg H) \). Finally, we'll apply Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \). Let's break it down step by step and assume some reasonable estimates for these values:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
    - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Assume a relatively low value, since it's a specific field. Let's say 0.05 (5%).
    - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Assume a moderate value, as computer science is a common field. Let's say 0.15 (15%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \):
        - High likelihood since the personality traits (curiosity about nature, empathy for animals) align well. Let's estimate 0.8.
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \):
        - Lower likelihood as empathy for animals and curiosity about nature are less directly related to computer science. Let's estimate 0.3.

3. **Probability of the Evidence \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \):
        - Given many fields don't align well with his traits, this is somewhat low. Let's estimate 0.2.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{computer science}}) \):
        - This could be higher given the broader range of other fields that might align with some of his traits, though still less than arbitrary. Let's estimate 0.5.

Now, let's use Bayesâ€™ Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For "agricultural and veterinary science":

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.05)) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.1739 \]

For "computer science":

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.15) + (0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.15)) = 0.045 + 0.425 = 0.47 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.47} \approx 0.0957 \]

Therefore, the computed probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1739,
  "computer science": 0.0957
}
