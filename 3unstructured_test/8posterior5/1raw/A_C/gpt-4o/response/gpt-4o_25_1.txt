To apply Bayes' rule, we need a few probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that field.
4. \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being in that field given his personality sketch.

We'll make a few assumptions and then run the numbers based on those.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **\(P(H)\)**: The prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it is relatively unlikely among all graduate fields, say 0.05.
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, this is high because his love for animals and curiosity about nature suit this field well. Let's set this to 0.8.
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in this field. This should be lower than \(P(E|H)\) because his traits are particularly suited to this field. Let's assume 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.05)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.095} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.296 \]

### Computer Science
- **\(P(H)\)**: The prior probability of being enrolled in computer science. Given the higher likelihood of students enrolling in this field generally, say 0.15.
- **\(P(E|H)\)**: Given Adam's intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, this is moderate but not explicitly the most fitting field given his love for nature and animals. Set this to 0.3.
- **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: This should be lower than for agricultural and veterinary science but higher than purely random given the many fields Adam could be in. Let's set this to 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.3 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.15)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.215} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.209 \]

So the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "computer science": 0.209
}
```
