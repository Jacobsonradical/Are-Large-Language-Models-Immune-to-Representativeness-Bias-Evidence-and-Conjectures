To apply Bayes' Rule to calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science based on his personality sketch, we need to evaluate the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality fits the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality fits fields other than the given field.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam is enrolled in computer science.

We'll make educated assumptions for the sake of calculation:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**:
   - \( P(H_1) \): Let's assume a moderate prior probability since this field is reasonably common among graduate students. Assume \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \).
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): His personality aligns well with this field due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. Assume high likelihood \( P(E|H_1) = 0.80 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): This is the probability of Adam having this personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming graduates in other fields also have diverse personalities, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.30 \).

2. **Computer Science (H2)**:
   - \( P(H_2) \): Let’s assume a common prior probability as this field is commonly pursued. Assume \( P(H_2) = 0.20 \).
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): Some elements like high intelligence and abstract thinking fit computer science, but the aspects related to nature and animals don't fit as well. Assume \( P(E|H_2) = 0.40 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): This is again assuming diversity in personalities of students in other fields, \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.30 \).

Bayes' Rule for calculating \( P(H|E) \) is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

„
We now calculate \( P(H_1|E) \) and \( P(H_2|E) \).

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**:
\[ P(E) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.30 \cdot (1 - 0.15) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.30 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375 \]

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.375} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.375} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) \approx 0.32 \]

**Computer Science (H2)**:
\[ P(E) = 0.40 \cdot 0.20 + 0.30 \cdot (1 - 0.20) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.40 \cdot 0.20 + 0.30 \cdot 0.80 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.24 = 0.32 \]

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.20}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = 0.25 \]
