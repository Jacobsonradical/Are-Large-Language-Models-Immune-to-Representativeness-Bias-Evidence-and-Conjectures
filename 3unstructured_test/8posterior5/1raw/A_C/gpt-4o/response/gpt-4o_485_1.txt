Sure, let's evaluate the probabilities step-by-step.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in computer science. Given no additional information, we'll assume a nominal value. Let's consider computer science is a popular field, so we might say \(P(H) = 0.3\). 
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is in computer science. Adam's traits related to understanding abstract concepts and high intelligence align well with computer science, but his love for nature and animals might not be a strong fit. So, a moderate value seems appropriate, say \(P(E|H) = 0.4\).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he's not in computer science. There are numerous fields where Adam's characteristics could fit well, so we might assign this a value of \(0.6\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where \(P(E)\) can be derived using Total Probability:
\[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]

Let’s assume the prior probability of not being in computer science is \(P(\neg H) = 0.7\). Now, we compute \(P(E)\):
\[P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.6 \cdot 0.7 = 0.12 + 0.42 = 0.54\]

So,
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.54} \approx 0.222\]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's consider it a less common field than computer science, so we might say \(P(H) = 0.1\).
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given that Adam is in this field. Adam's traits such as love for nature, animals, empathy, and a warm heart align well with this field. Hence, a high value might be appropriate, say \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he's not in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower because his traits are quite specialized. So, we might assign \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.45\).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where \(P(E)\) can be derived using Total Probability:
\[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]

Let’s assume the prior probability of not being in agricultural and veterinary science is \(P(\neg H) = 0.9\). Now, we compute \(P(E)\):
\[P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.45 \cdot 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.405 = 0.485\]

So,
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.485} \approx 0.165\]

Here are the results in the required format:

{
  "computer science": 0.222,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.165
}
