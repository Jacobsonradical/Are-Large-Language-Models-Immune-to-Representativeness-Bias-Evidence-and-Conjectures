First, let's denote and analyze the probabilities for each field:

1. **Enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1):**
   - **P(H1)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - **P(E|H1)**: Given that Adam is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, the likelihood of his personality sketch (E) fitting.
   - **P(E|¬H1)**: Given that Adam is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, the likelihood of his personality sketch (E) fitting.

2. **Enrolled in Computer Science (H2):**
   - **P(H2)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
   - **P(E|H2)**: Given that Adam is in Computer Science, the likelihood of his personality sketch (E) fitting.
   - **P(E|¬H2)**: Given that Adam is not in Computer Science, the likelihood of his personality sketch (E) fitting.

We will use these to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify, we will assume some reasonable approximations for these values.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)

**P(H1):** Let's assume the prior probability of being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is moderate for a graduate student, say 0.2.

**P(E|H1):** Given Adam's personality traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood that he fits this field is quite high. Let's say 0.9.

**P(E|¬H1):** Given that Adam has these traits, the likelihood that he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science but still has these traits is also plausible but less likely. Let's say 0.4.

### Computer Science (H2)

**P(H2):** The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in Computer Science is also moderate. Let's say 0.3.

**P(E|H2):** Given Adam's personality traits, the likelihood of him being enrolled in Computer Science is decent but not as high since the traits don't directly align. Let's say 0.5.

**P(E|¬H2):** Given his traits, it's quite possible for Adam to be in other fields than Computer Science. Let's say 0.6.

### Calculations

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

- For Computer Science:
\[
P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{P(E)}
\]

Since we are only interested in comparing these two fields, we do not need the exact value of P(E). We compare the numerators directly:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18 \)
- Computer Science: \( 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.15 \)

Given these calculations, we can now compute the approximate posterior probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```
