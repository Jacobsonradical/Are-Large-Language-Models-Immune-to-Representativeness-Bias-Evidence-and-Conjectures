To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field based on his personality sketch (E), we can use Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that hypothesis \(H\) is true given evidence \(E\).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing evidence \(E\) given that hypothesis \(H\) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\) being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing evidence \(E\).

We need values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) to perform this calculation.

Given that Adam has a strong appreciation for nature, plants, animals, and enjoys solving puzzles while being highly intelligent, we can estimate these probabilities for each field:

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume this field is quite common among graduate students, so we set \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's traits given that he is studying computer science. Although a highly intelligent person who enjoys solving puzzles might fit a computer science profile, the appreciation for nature and animals is less aligned. So, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's traits if he is not studying computer science. Given that there are many other fields that align more closely with his traits, we set \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.02 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common than computer science but aligns well with his traits, so we set \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's traits given that he is studying agricultural and veterinary science. His traits are very well aligned with this field, so let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \).
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's traits if he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science. Since these traits are specifically well-suited to this field, let's set \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.04 \).

Now we calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.92 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.045 + 0.69} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.755} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.026 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.92 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.02 + 0.69} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.045}{0.755} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.06 \]

Therefore, the estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.026,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.06
}
