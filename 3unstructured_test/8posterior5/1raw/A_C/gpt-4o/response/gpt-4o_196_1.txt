To apply Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.

Lastly, we use Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given his personality sketch.

Let's start with some reasonable estimations:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student was in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume that 5% of graduate students are in this field.
  \[
  P(H)_{\text{agri-veter}} = 0.05
  \]

- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's attributes (love for nature and animals, empathy, etc.), it seems very likely he would be a good fit for this field. Let’s assign this a high probability, say 0.8.
  \[
  P(E|H)_{\text{agri-veter}} = 0.8
  \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having these traits if he's not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his personality traits, these could apply to other fields such as biology or environmental science, so let's say this is moderately likely at 0.2.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H)_{\text{agri-veter}} = 0.2
  \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H)}
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agri-veter}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95}
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agri-veter}} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174
\]


### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is in computer science. Let's assume a higher rate, say 20%, given the popularity of the field.
  \[
  P(H)_{\text{cs}} = 0.2
  \]

- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s characteristics (high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts), there's a moderate fit here, but not as perfect as agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assign this a probability of 0.5.
  \[
  P(E|H)_{\text{cs}} = 0.5
  \]

- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having these traits if he's not in computer science. This is similar to our previous estimation for non-agricultural fields, so let's say it's moderately likely at 0.2.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H)_{\text{cs}} = 0.2
  \]

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8}
\]
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.16} = \frac{0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.385
\]

Given these calculations, here are the probabilities:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "computer science": 0.385
}
```

These probabilities reflect our reasonable estimations based on the personality sketch and general knowledge of field distributions and requirements.
