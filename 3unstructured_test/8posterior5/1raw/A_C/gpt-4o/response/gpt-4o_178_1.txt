To apply Bayes' rule for each of the fields (agricultural and veterinary science and computer science) given Adam's personality sketch and background as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, we need to determine the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in the respective field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the respective field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the respective field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the respective field given the personality sketch \( E \).

Let's start with some rough estimates for the priors and conditional probabilities.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **\( P(H_{ag}) \)**:
   - Assume that the distribution of graduate students in the U.S. is somewhat even across various fields, with a somewhat lower proportion in specialized fields like agricultural and veterinary science, let's assume \( P(H_{ag}) \approx 0.05 \).

2. **\( P(E|H_{ag}) \)**:
   - Given that Adam has a deep love for animals, nature, and plants, and he exhibits empathy and dedication, it is quite likely that this aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, let's assume \( P(E|H_{ag}) \approx 0.8 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{ag}) \)**:
   - The probability of observing Adam's profile in other fields might be lower because his interests are strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science, but not zero, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{ag}) \approx 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
\]

We need \( P(E) \), the total probability of \( E \). However, since we are only comparing relative likelihoods, we can fix \( P(E) \) and calculate normalized probabilities later.

#### Computer Science:
1. **\( P(H_{cs}) \)**:
   - Computer science is a highly popular field, so let's assume \( P(H_{cs}) \approx 0.15 \).

2. **\( P(E|H_{cs}) \)**:
   - Although Adam is good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which fit a computer science profile, his strong connection to nature and animals may make this slightly less probable. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{cs}) \approx 0.4 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \)**:
   - The probability of observing Adamâ€™s profile in non-computer science fields is higher compared to computer science itself due to his nature-oriented interests. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \approx 0.6 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}
\]

Again, since we are comparing relative likelihoods, we can normalize them:

Now we compute \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag}) + P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + \text{other fields}
\]

Given the following simplified approach:
\[
P(H_{ag}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04
\]
\[
P(H_{cs}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.15 = 0.06
\]

Now normalize:
\[
P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.06} = 0.4
\]
\[
P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.04 + 0.06} = 0.6
\]

Therefore, we can summarize the results as:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values represent the relative likelihood, so they do not need to sum to 1 because other fields' probabilities are not included in this simplified calculation. The actual likelihoods may vary based on more precise priors and conditional probabilities.
