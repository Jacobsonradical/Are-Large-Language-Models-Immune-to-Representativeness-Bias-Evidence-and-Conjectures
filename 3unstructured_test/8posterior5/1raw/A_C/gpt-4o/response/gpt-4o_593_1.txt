To estimate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis regarding Adam's field of study, we need to consider the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field of study.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in a particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in that particular field.

We can then use Bayes' rule to calculate the posterior probability, \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since we do not have specific data on the exact priors and likelihoods, the following estimates are based on how well the personality sketch of Adam aligns with typical characteristics of students in computer science and agricultural and veterinary science. 

### Assumptions:
- Computer Science (CS) students often have strong analytical skills and may enjoy logical problem-solving, but a deep love for animals and nature is less typical.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS) students are more likely to have a passion for nature, plants, and animals, and an empathetic and warm-hearted nature fits well.
- We will assume general priors \( P(H) \) as equally likely for simplicity since specific admission statistics are not provided.

### Estimates:
- Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \) and \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.05 \). 

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2, \quad P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.05
\]

### Likelihoods:
- Given Adam's characteristics, \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) might be moderate considering analytical skills and curiosity fit, but high empathy and love for animals are less common.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \) is likely to be high, given the strong alignment with typical traits.

\[
P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4, \quad P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.8
\]

### Complementary Likelihoods:
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \) would generally be higher than for CS, but still not as high as AVS fields that suit his profile.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.3 \) as AVS fits particularly well, and other non-related fields collectively would have varied fits.

\[
P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.5, \quad P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.3
\]

### Posterior Calculation:
Finally, applying Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Here, we approximate \( P(E) \) by considering the general prevalence and fit.

### For Computer Science:
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08
\]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04
\]

Normalizing (assuming no specific sum constraint):
\[
 P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.04} \approx 0.67  \quad \text{for CS}
 P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.08 + 0.04} \approx 0.33 \quad \text{for AVS}
\]
