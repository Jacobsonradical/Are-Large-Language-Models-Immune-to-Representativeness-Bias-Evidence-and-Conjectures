Sure, let's try to estimate the probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given he has a strong empathy, deep love for animals, and an interest in nature, we might assign a relatively high value here. Let's estimate this as 0.3.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given H. Given his personality traits (curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals), these traits strongly align with this field. Let's assign a high value here, perhaps 0.9.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing E given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This can be distributed across many other fields but because these traits are quite specific, let's assign a value of 0.2.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was studying computer science. This is another common field for high-intelligence individuals who enjoy solving puzzles, but his other traits (love for animals, nature) don't align as strongly. Let's estimate this as 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given H (computer science). While his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills align with computer science, his other interests (nature, animals) don't. Let's assign a moderate value of 0.4.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing E given he is not in computer science. Since his traits are somewhat varied but also quite specific, let's assign a value of 0.3.

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Bayes' Rule states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.27 + 0.14 = 0.41 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.41} = \frac{0.27}{0.41} \approx 0.6585 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 = 0.08 + 0.24 = 0.32 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.32} = \frac{0.08}{0.32} = 0.25 \]

Hence, our results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6585,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```
These results indicate that based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
