Let's evaluate the probabilities step-by-step for each field based on Adam's personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.**
   
   Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and his empathy, it's relatively high:
   - Let's say around 0.3.

2. **P(E|H): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.**
   
   Since the sketch aligns well with this field (nature, animals, empathy), it's high:
   - Let's set it at 0.8.

3. **P(E|\neg H): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he's not in agricultural and veterinary science.**
   
   Given Adam's personality traits could fit other fields as well, especially those involving animals or nature, it's moderate:
   - We'll use 0.3 for this.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's substitute the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{0.8 \times 0.3 + 0.3 \times 0.7} = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.21} = \frac{0.24}{0.45} \approx 0.533 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.**

   Given Adam is intelligent, good at abstract concepts, and likes puzzles, it's moderate:
   - Let's say around 0.2.

2. **P(E|H): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science.**

   Adam's love for nature and animals is less aligned with computer science, but his intelligence and puzzle-solving are good fits:
   - Let's set it at 0.4.

3. **P(E|\neg H): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he's not in computer science.**

   Given Adam's personality traits could fit other fields well too:
   - We'll use 0.3 for this as well.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's substitute the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.4 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.24} = \frac{0.08}{0.32} = 0.25 \]
