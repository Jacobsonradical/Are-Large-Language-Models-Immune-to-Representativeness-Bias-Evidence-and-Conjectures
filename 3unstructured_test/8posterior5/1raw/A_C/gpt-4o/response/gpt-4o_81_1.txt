To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields using Bayes' Rule, we need to first specify the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) if he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) if he was not enrolled in that field.

Then, Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch) serves as a normalizing constant and does not affect the ratio between different fields, we can focus on comparing the numerators.

### 1. Computer Science

#### Assumptions
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science. Let’s assume a broad estimate, say 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood that Adam’s personality traits (such as curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving) fit a computer science student. Let's assume a value like 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of Adam’s personality traits in the general graduate student population, not in computer science. Let's assume a value like 0.1.

#### Calculation
Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Assumptions
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate a value around 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood that Adam’s personality traits fit within agricultural and veterinary science, given his strong curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals. Let's assume a value like 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of Adam’s personality traits in the general graduate student population, not in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a value like 0.1.

#### Calculation
Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

### Normalization

To find the probabilities:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.07} = \frac{0.08}{0.15} \approx 0.53 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.07}{0.08 + 0.07} = \frac{0.07}{0.15} \approx 0.47 \]

However, recall that we are not required to normalize to 1 since there are other fields:

### Answer
\[ 
\{
  "computer science": "0.53",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.47"
\}
\]

Note that these are rough estimates to illustrate the approach. Actual probabilities can vary based on more precise data.
