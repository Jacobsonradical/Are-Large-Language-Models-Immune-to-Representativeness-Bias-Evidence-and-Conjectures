Sure, to compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don’t have the exact numerical values, we will need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the information provided.

### For Computer Science:

1. **P(H)** (prior probability Adam was enrolled in computer science):
   - Computer science is a popular field, so let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) to be moderate.
   - Suppose \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

2. **P(E|H)** (likelihood of E, given H):
   - The personality sketch does not strongly align with the stereotypical profile of a computer science graduate (i.e., curiosity about nature, strong empathy for animals, love for plants). Hence, \( P(E|H) \) should be quite low.
   - Suppose \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)** (likelihood of E, given not H):
   - Considering many other fields could align better with Adam’s personality traits, the likelihood of E given not in computer science could be considerably higher.
   - Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

Using these values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.7 \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.7 \cdot 0.7 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.49 = 0.52 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.52} \approx 0.0577 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **P(H)** (prior probability Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science):
   - This field closely aligns with Adam’s personality traits. Although less common than computer science, it’s still a logical fit.
   - Suppose \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **P(E|H)** (likelihood of E, given H):
   - The personality sketch strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary sciences. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) should be high.
   - Suppose \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)** (likelihood of E, given not H):
   - Given that Adam’s personality is closely related to agricultural and veterinary sciences, the likelihood given not in this field should be lower.
   - Suppose \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using these values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.18 + 0.32 = 0.5 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.5} = 0.36 \]

So the results in the required format would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.0577, 
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36
}
