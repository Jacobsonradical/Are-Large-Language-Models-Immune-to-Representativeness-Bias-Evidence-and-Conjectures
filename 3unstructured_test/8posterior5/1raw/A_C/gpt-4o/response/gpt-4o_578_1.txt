To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in computer science and agricultural and veterinary science, we need to use Bayes' rule, which states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will assume some prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on the information in the personality sketch. Because this is subjective, we'll need to make some approximations.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**: Let's assume the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science is moderate, say 0.2.
2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood**: Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which align with traits valuable in computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for nature and animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are not typical indicators of a preference for computer science. Let's assign a likelihood of 0.4.
3. **P(E|\neg H) - Complementary Likelihood**: Given Adam's broader range of interests outside typical computer science traits, assume a basic likelihood of 0.05 as a rough estimate.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability**: Assume the probability that a graduate student specializes in agricultural and veterinary science is lower, say 0.1.
2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood**: Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, plants, strong empathy, deep love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and dedication sync well with this field. Assign a high likelihood of 0.8.
3. **P(E|\neg H) - Complementary Likelihood**: Given his demonstrated interests, traits not aligning with agricultural and veterinary science would be noticeably lower, assumed to be around 0.05.

### Calculations:

Using Bayes' Rule for each field:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and acts as a normalization constant, it can be simplified away for comparative purposes:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]

Calculations:

1. **Computer Science** terms:
    \[
    P(E|H)P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08
    \]
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** terms:
    \[
    P(E|H)P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08
    \]

After normalization (as normalization constant is the same for both):

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \approx 0.08
\]
\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \approx 0.08
\]

Effectively, both fields have comparable Bayesian probability given the trait descriptions. 

So my prior probabilities and conditional likelihoods lead us to:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

In terms of percentage distributions, showing that agricultural and veterinary science is ultimately more likely for Adam given the personality sketch provided.
