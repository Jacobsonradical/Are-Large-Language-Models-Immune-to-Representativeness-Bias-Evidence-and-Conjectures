To compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field, we need to consider Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the traits described in \(E\), given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the traits described in \(E\), given that Adam is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the traits described in \(E\).

Since we only need to determine the relative probabilities, the exact value of \(P(E)\) (the denominator) is not necessaryâ€”it will be a normalizing constant.

Let's denote our fields properly and set estimated values for the probabilities based on the given personality sketch and the relevance to the field of study:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants, this field seems highly plausible.
   - \( P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \): We can assume this to be the base rate for graduate students in this field. Let's assume \(P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}) = 0.05\) (5%).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \): Given the match in personality traits, let's estimate this as high, say 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \): Less likely but possible given a random field, so let's take this as, say, 0.2.

2. **Computer science**: Although Adam is highly intelligent and good at abstract concepts, his genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals doesn't align directly with this field. 
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Assume the base rate for graduate students in this field is relatively high, say \(P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2\) (20%).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Given the mismatch in interests but high intelligence, this can be low, say, 0.3.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): More likely than specific match to CS, e.g., 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule, we can calculate:

- For **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgriVet}})}{P(E)}
  \]
  Given this will be a normalizing constant, let's write in terms of relative probabilities:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04
  \]

- For **Computer science**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)}
  \]
  \[
  P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06
  \]

Given that the overall comparison is primarily what matters here, these would be normalized in context of total probability being 1 for full priors considered, but as requested strictly:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
