To use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\), we need the following:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood that Adam exhibits personality traits E given that he was enrolled in that specific field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The likelihood that Adam exhibits personality traits E given that he was not enrolled in that specific field.

Bayes’ rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let’s start with our assumption values for each component:

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Since CS is a common field, we will assume a moderate prior:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the personality traits given enrollment in CS. Traits like intelligence and abstract thinking can be significant here, but curiosity about nature and animals might not be directly relevant:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the personality traits given that Adam was not enrolled in CS. Since we are considering all other fields combined:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common than CS among graduate students, so let’s assume:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.05 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the personality traits given enrollment in AgVet science. Many of his traits, like curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, align very well:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.8 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the personality traits given that Adam was not enrolled in AgVet science:
\[ P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.25 \]

Now, let’s calculate \(P(E)\) for each case.

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.14} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.4286 \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.25 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.2375 = 0.2775 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.2775} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.2775} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \approx 0.1442 \]

Thus, the answers are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4286,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1442
}
