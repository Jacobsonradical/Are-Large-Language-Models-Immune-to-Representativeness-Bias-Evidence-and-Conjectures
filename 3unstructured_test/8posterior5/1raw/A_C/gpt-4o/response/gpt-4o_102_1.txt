Sure, let's break down the information given to calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Given the information available, we will make some estimating assumptions for these probabilities.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H) (prior probability):** Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science is moderate, say \(0.30\) (30%).
2. **P(E|H) (likelihood):** Personality traits like genuine curiosity, high intelligence, and good at understanding abstract concepts fit well with computer science, let's assume \(0.50\) (50%).
3. **P(E|\neg H) (complement likelihood):** The probability of observing these traits if Adam is not enrolled in computer science but in another field, let's assume \(0.20\) (20%).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H) (prior probability):** Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is less common, say \(0.10\) (10%).
2. **P(E|H) (likelihood):** Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, and empathy, it fits quite well, let's assume \(0.70\) (70%).
3. **P(E|\neg H) (complement likelihood):** The probability of observing these traits if Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science but in another field, let's assume \(0.10\) (10%).

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Assuming \( P(E) \) is integrated out as part of normalization, we get:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.50 \cdot 0.30 = 0.15 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Assuming \( P(E) \) is integrated out as part of normalization, we get:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.70 \cdot 0.10 = 0.07 \]

To normalize these values, we calculate a sum and then divide each by that sum.

Sum = \( 0.15 + 0.07 = 0.22 \)

Normalized probabilities:
- For Computer Science: 
  \[ \frac{0.15}{0.22} \approx 0.68 \]
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 
  \[ \frac{0.07}{0.22} \approx 0.32 \]

Therefore, the computed probabilities are:

  "computer science": 0.68,
