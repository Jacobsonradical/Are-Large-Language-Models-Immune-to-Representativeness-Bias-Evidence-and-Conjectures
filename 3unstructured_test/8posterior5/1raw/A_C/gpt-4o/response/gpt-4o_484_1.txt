To make an informed judgment based on Adam's personality sketch, let's consider the probabilities for each of the fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
#### P(H)
The likelihood that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his interest in nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals seems relatively high.

#### P(E|H)
Given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, it seems very likely that he would have a genuine curiosity about nature and plants and a deep love for animals. Therefore, the traits described in the personality sketch closely match those of someone in this field.

#### P(E|¬H)
Understanding the likelihood of Adam having these traits if he were not in agricultural and veterinary science, it's possible but less likely compared to someone in this field. Other fields might not necessarily foster such strong interests in nature, empathy, and animals.

### Computer Science:
#### P(H)
Given Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, being in computer science is a possibility, albeit more remote considering his stronger affinity for nature and animals.

#### P(E|H)
If Adam were enrolled in computer science, the personality traits related to nature, empathy, and love for animals would be less relevant, but his intelligence and problem-solving skills would fit. Hence, this probability is moderate.

#### P(E|¬H)
Given the traits, there are many other fields (especially those related to nature or social sciences) where such traits would fit, making it less likely that a student with such strong empathy and nature-related interests would be in computer science.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant.

Given our qualitative assessment:
- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  - P(H) ≈ 0.3 (somewhat likely given his interests and traits align)
  - P(E|H) ≈ 0.9 (very high given traits align strongly)
  - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.1 (traits are less likely outside this field)

- For computer science:
  - P(H) ≈ 0.2 (possible, but less likely given his interests)
  - P(E|H) ≈ 0.4 (moderate, as some traits match)
  - P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.2 (many fields share similar abstract/problem-solving skills)

To focus on proportionality and without exact normalization, combining these judgments:

\[
\begin{aligned}
  P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) &\approx \frac{0.9 \times 0.3}{P(E)}\\
  P(\text{computer science}|E) &\approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{P(E)}
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus, the relative probabilities suggest a stronger support for agricultural and veterinary science versus computer science.
