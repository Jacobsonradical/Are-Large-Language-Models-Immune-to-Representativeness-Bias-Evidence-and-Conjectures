To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to assess the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in each field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, derived using Bayes' theorem.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) is the unconditional probability of observing the personality sketch. 

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, for simplicity, we'll focus on computing the proportional values as follows:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's assign estimated probabilities in the context of the given personality sketch:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. \( P(H) \): As many students in the U.S. pursue various disciplines, let's assign a moderate prior probability. Say \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and deep empathy, it is highly likely for him to be in this field. Say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given Adam's personality, if he isn't in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability that he has such a personality remains but would be lower compared to \( P(E|H) \). Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \).

### Computer Science
1. \( P(H) \): Given the overall high enrollment rates in computer science, let's assign a higher prior probability. Say \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Computer science students may have various personalities. Adam's love for nature and animals is less indicative of computer science. Say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam isn't in computer science, the probability of his personality sketch would be higher compared to \( E|H \). Say \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \).

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities
To find the proportional relationship:
\[ \text{Score for Agricultural and Veterinary Science} = P(H) \cdot P(E|H) = 0.1 \times 0.8 = 0.08 \]
\[ \text{Score for Computer Science} = P(H) \cdot P(E|H) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

### Normalizing the Scores
The total score is \( 0.08 + 0.06 = 0.14 \). Let's normalize them:
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.14} \approx 0.57 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.43 \]

Thus, the answer would be:
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57,
  "computer science": 0.43
