To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for the specified fields using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in that field without considering the given sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is not enrolled in that field.
4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**: This is the probability of Adam being enrolled in that field given the personality sketch \( E \), computed using Bayes' rule.

Let's assume the following initial probabilities for simplicity as they are not provided:

- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_{\text{Other}}) \): The probability that Adam is enrolled in any other field.

Given:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{Other}}) = 0.5 \)

Now let's estimate the likelihoods based on the personality sketch for both hypotheses (computer science and agricultural and veterinary science):

- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Although Adam has high intelligence and understands abstract concepts which align with computer science, his curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals do not fit as strongly. Let's assign \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \).
  
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Adam's personality sketch aligns very well with agricultural and veterinary science due to his curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work. Let's assign \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.6 \).

The marginal likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \) should consider the probability of the sketch for the rest of the fields:

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): Let's assume a moderate probability considering the sketch fits better with agricultural and other nature-related fields. Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \).
  
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Considering the sketch fits better with agricultural sciences, this should be lower. Let's assign \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common and need not be computed for the relative comparison, we will compute the numerator for each hypothesis:

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12 \]

Now converting these to probabilities relative to each other:
\[ \text{Total} = 0.06 + 0.12 = 0.18 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.18} = 0.33 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.18} = 0.67 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67
}
