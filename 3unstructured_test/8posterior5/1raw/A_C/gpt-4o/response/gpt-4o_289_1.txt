To calculate \( P(H|E) \) — the probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch (E) — we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having his personality traits given he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having his personality traits given he is not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality traits E.

We will compute these in two cases: for computer science and agricultural and veterinary science.

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the general likelihood of a graduate student being in computer science is moderate, say \( 0.2 \) (20%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's curiosity, problem-solving skills, and high intelligence, his likelihood of being in computer science is relatively high, say \( 0.7 \) (70%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of having Adam's personality traits given he is not in computer science might be lower, say \( 0.3 \) (30%).

Plugging these values into Bayes' Rule, we first compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38 \]

Then, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.368 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): The general likelihood of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower, say \( 0.1 \) (10%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals, his likelihood of being in agricultural and veterinary science is high, say \( 0.8 \) (80%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of having Adam's personality traits given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower, say \( 0.4 \) (40%).

Plugging these values into Bayes' Rule, first compute \( P(E) \) similarly:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.36 = 0.44 \]

Then calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.44} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.182 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.368,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182
}
