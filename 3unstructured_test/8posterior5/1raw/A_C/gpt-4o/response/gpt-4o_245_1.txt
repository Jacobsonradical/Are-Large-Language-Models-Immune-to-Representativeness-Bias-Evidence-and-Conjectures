To determine the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of agricultural and veterinary science and computer science, we'll utilize Bayes' rule. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was not enrolled in that field.

Given that \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, we can focus on the relative values for the different fields. Let's make some reasoned estimates for each field based on the provided sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Suppose it’s moderately uncommon.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's personality sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy) aligns very well with this field.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that someone not in agricultural and veterinary science would still fit Adam's personality sketch. This is less likely but not too low since the traits can be somewhat common across other fields as well.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \]

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science. This is quite common.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.3 \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's personality sketch (solving puzzles, high intelligence, abstract concepts understanding) fits reasonably well, but less strongly than for agricultural and veterinary science.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that someone not in computer science would fit Adam's personality sketch is slightly higher given the generic nature of some attributes.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \]

Given these estimates, let's compute \( P(H|E) \).

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We don’t know \( P(E) \), but we can compare the relative strengths:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.08 \]

### For Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Again, we compare:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.3 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.18 \]

Given these proportions, we can convert these into approximate values between 0 and 1.

### Output

Given the normalization step which we skip here, the values reflecting the proportion of \( P(H|E) \) are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These reflect that, based on the provided personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be in computer science than in agricultural and veterinary science, although he does have a significant fit for agricultural and veterinary science too.
