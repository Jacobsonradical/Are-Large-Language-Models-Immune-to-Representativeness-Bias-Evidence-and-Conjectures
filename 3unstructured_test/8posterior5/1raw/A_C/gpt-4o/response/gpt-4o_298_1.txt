First, let's determine the probabilities for each hypothesis and condition based on the provided personality sketch of Adam.

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

#### Calculations:
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Let's assume P(H) is relatively moderate because agricultural and veterinary science is a less common field for graduate students compared to other fields like business or engineering.
  - We'll assign a reasonable value to this: \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

- **P(E|H)**: This is the probability that Adam has the given attributes given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Since Adam has a love for nature and animals, this field aligns very well with his interests and personality.
  - We'll set this high: \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability that Adam has the given personality sketch while not being in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Given there are many other fields and not all align perfectly with his traits, but still possible, we'll give a more moderate value: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.27} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25
\]

**So for agricultural and veterinary science, \( P(H|E) = 0.25 \).**

**2. Computer Science**

#### Calculations:
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is in the field of computer science.
  - We assume P(H) is relatively higher due to the popularity of this field.
  - We'll assign a reasonable higher value to this: \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H)**: This is the probability that Adam has the given attributes given he is in computer science.
  - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is highly intelligent, which align well with the typical traits of computer science students.
  - We'll set this as: \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability that Adam has the given personality sketch while not being in computer science.
  - Given Adam's empathy and love for animals, these characteristics are not as typical for the demographic, but possible.
  - We'll set this as: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.32} = \frac{0.14}{0.46} \approx 0.304
\]

**So for computer science, \( P(H|E) \approx 0.304 \).**

So overall, the values are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.304
}
```
