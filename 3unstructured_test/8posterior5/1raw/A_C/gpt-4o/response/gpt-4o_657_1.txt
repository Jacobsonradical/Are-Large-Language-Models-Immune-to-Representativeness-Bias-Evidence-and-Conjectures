To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field.

Let's break it down:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a common field for graduate students, so let's assume \( P(H) \) is moderately high, say 0.2.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch of having a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high empathy is less typically associated with computer science students. So, let's assume \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low, perhaps 0.1.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: We need the overall likelihood of the personality sketch in students not in computer science. If we assume students in other fields are more likely to match this profile, \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be moderately high, say 0.5.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is a less common field compared to computer science, so let's assume \( P(H) \) is lower, perhaps 0.1.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The sketch fits very well with this field (curiosity about nature, love for animals), so \( P(E|H) \) should be high, perhaps 0.6.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This would be the likelihood of the sketch for all other fields (besides agricultural and veterinary science). Given the strong alignment of the personality sketch with this field, \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be somewhere in the middle, say 0.2.

To compute \( P(H|E) \), we first need to estimate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.4 = 0.42 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.2)}{0.42} \approx 0.048 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) = 0.06 + 0.18 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.6 \cdot 0.1)}{0.24} \approx 0.25 \]

Hence, the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:

{
  "computer science": "0.048",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.25"
}
