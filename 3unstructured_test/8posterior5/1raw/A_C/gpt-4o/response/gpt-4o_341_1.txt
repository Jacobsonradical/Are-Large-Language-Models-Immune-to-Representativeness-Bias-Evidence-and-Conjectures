Let's start by evaluating the probabilities and applying Bayes' theorem to compute the probability.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Computer Science is a popular graduate program, so let's assume P(H) = 0.2.
   - P(E|H): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in Computer Science. Given Adam's strong intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, this seems reasonably plausible. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.4.
   - P(E|¬H): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not in Computer Science. Given the breadth of other fields, this might also be plausible but not as high as in Computer Science because some other fields may not align well with his specific characteristics. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} 
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.24} = \frac{0.08}{0.32} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - P(H): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This field is less common, so let's assume P(H) = 0.05.
   - P(E|H): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, this is quite plausible. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.8.
   - P(E|¬H): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This is less likely since not all other fields align well with his specific traits. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.2.

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174
   \]

So, based on the above calculations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174
}
```

Both probabilities reflect how well Adam's personality fits within the context of the respective fields, but it's important to note these are based on assumed probabilities and percentages.
