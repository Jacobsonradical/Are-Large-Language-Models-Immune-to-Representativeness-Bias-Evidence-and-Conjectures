To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in either "computer science" or "agricultural and veterinary science" given the personality sketch provided (E), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in the specified field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having his personality traits given he is in the specified field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam having his personality traits.

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both fields, it will scale the results proportionally, but we only need the ratio between them. 

Note: For simplicity, let's assume some subjective values for these probabilities based on common knowledge and general trends in these fields.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H):** The probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is fairly moderate given the wide popularity of the field.
2. **P(E|H):** It is somewhat reasonable to have a quiet, empathetic, and intelligent personality in computer science, but the deep love for nature and animals may not be a strong fit.
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of the personality sketch if Adam is not in computer science is higher because the traits can fit better in other fields (like those related to nature).

Assumed values:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.8 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H):** The probability of Adam being enrolled in this field is moderate.
2. **P(E|H):** The given personality sketch fits very well with this field, as traits like a love for nature and animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work match closely with this field.
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of the personality sketch if Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science is lower because the traits fit better in this field compared to most others.

Assumed values:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

### Applying Bayes' Rule
#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{\text{common factor}} \approx 0.06 / \text{common factor} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{\text{common factor}} \approx 0.21 / \text{common factor} \]

Normalizing these probabilities because \(P(E)\) is the same in both calculations:

For computer science:
\[ \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.21} \approx 0.22 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ \frac{0.21}{0.06 + 0.21} \approx 0.78 \]

So the results are:

{
  "computer science": 0.22,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.78
}
