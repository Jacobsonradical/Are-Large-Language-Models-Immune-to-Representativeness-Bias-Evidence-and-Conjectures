To apply Bayes' theorem, we'll need reasonable estimates for the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) — The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) — The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) — The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the specific field.

Let's begin with prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)). Graduate students can specialize in various fields, but since there is no specific prior information:

- Let's assume \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.2 \)
- Let's assume \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.1 \)

For \( P(E|H) \):

- For computer science, given the traits described in the personality sketch, Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence align well with attributes common in the computer science field, but the empathy and love for animals less so. Let's estimate \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.1 \).

- For agricultural and veterinary science, the alignment is stronger given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. Thus, let's estimate \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.7 \).

For \( P(E|\neg H) \):

- Considering fields other than computer science or agricultural and veterinary science, Adam's profile might moderately match many others like biology, psychology, etc. We can conservatively estimate \( P(E|\neg\text{computer science}) \approx 0.3 \) and \( P(E|\neg\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.3 \) to account for the match with multiple other fields.

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expressed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Estimates for \( P(H|E) \) for computer science:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{(0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

Estimates for \( P(H|E) \) for agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{(0.7 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.27} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{0.07}{0.34} \approx 0.206 \]

Therefore, the updated probabilities via Bayes' rule are:

{
  "computer science": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.206
