To use Bayes' rule for this problem, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the given field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field given the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We assume P(E) to normalize our probabilities, but since we're only comparing two fields and are not required to sum to 1, it simplifies our calculations.

Let's define our fields and probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - P(H_AG) = Prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - P(E|H_AG) = Probability that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - P(E|¬H_AG) = Probability that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not in agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - P(H_CS) = Prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science.
   - P(E|H_CS) = Probability that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in computer science.
   - P(E|¬H_CS) = Probability that Adam's personality sketch fits someone not in computer science.

Given Adam's personality traits and interests, we make the following assessments:
- P(H_AG) might be estimated based on the general distribution of graduate students across fields, but let's assume it's relatively low compared to more common fields like computer science, so we'll say 0.05.
- P(H_CS) is relatively high because computer science is a popular field, so we'll estimate 0.20.

Adam's personality sketch has characteristics that are highly compatible with Agricultural and Veterinary Science (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy), whereas fewer match the typical profiles seen in computer science despite his high intelligence.

Thus:
- P(E|H_AG) is high (say, 0.80).
- P(E|¬H_AG) would be lower, especially in contrast to other fields (let's say, 0.10).
  
For computer science:
- P(E|H_CS) might be somewhat compatible, given his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, but less fitting than Agricultural and Veterinary Science (say, 0.30).
- P(E|¬H_CS) would be more compatible because traits like empathy and love for animals are less relevant (say, 0.50).

Applying Bayes' rule:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AG}|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only comparing these two:
\[ P(H_{AG}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

Finally, normalizing within these fields:
\[ \frac{P(H_{AG}|E)}{P(H_{CS}|E)} = \frac{0.04}{0.06} = \frac{2}{3} \]

Putting it back into probabilities:

\[ P(H_{AG}|E) \approx \frac{2}{5} = 0.40 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{3}{5} = 0.60 \]

So our estimates are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.40,
  "computer science": 0.60
}
```
