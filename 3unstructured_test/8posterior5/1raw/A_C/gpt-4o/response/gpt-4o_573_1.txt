To determine the probabilities for each hypothesis \(H\) (i.e., Adam was enrolled in a specific field) given the personality sketch \(E\), we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits overall.

Given the problem, we will estimate these values based on the personality sketch provided.

### Computer Science
- \(P(H)\) (prior for computer science): Let's assume a typical distribution of students in various graduate fields. Computer science is a common field, so let's assign a prior probability of 0.20.
- \(P(E|H)\): Adam has traits such as high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, quiet, and enjoys puzzles, which are fairly common among computer science students. Let's assume this probability is 0.50.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of Adam's personality traits appearing in fields other than computer science (all other fields combined). Since these traits aren't exclusive to computer science, let's assume this probability is 0.30.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \(P(H)\) (prior for agricultural and veterinary science): This is a relatively less common field compared to computer science, but let's estimate a prior probability of 0.10.
- \(P(E|H)\): Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals is highly consistent with this field. Let's assume this probability is 0.70.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of Adam's personality traits appearing in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science. Since his traits of empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are notable but not exclusive, let's assume this probability is 0.25.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify the computation, assume \(P(E)\) remains constant across hypotheses. We will need comparative values rather than absolute probabilities.

### Calculation

For "computer science":
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.50 \cdot 0.20 = 0.10 \]

For "agricultural and veterinary science":
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) = 0.70 \cdot 0.10 = 0.07 \]

Normalizing the values:
\[ P(H|E)_{normalized} = \frac{P(H|E)}{\sum P(H|E)} \]

\[ Sum (P(H|E)_{CS} + P(H|E)_{AVS}) = 0.10 + 0.07 = 0.17 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.10}{0.17} \approx 0.59 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.07}{0.17} \approx 0.41 \]

Therefore,

  "computer science": 0.59,
