To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we'll evaluate the probabilities for each hypothesis. Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( E \): The personality sketch of Adam.

We'll need:
1. \( P(H_1) \): Prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student in the U.S. is in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(H_2) \): Prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student in the U.S. is in computer science.
3. \( P(E|H_1) \): Probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
4. \( P(E|H_2) \): Probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in computer science.
5. \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): Probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
6. \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): Probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in computer science.

While exact prior probabilities \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \) would ideally come from statistical data, we'll use reasonable approximations for the sake of this example:

- Let's assume an approximate prior \( P(H_1) = 0.05 \) (5% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science).
- Let's assume an approximate prior \( P(H_2) = 0.20 \) (20% of graduate students are in computer science).

Now we assess \( P(E|H_1) \) and \( P(E|H_2) \):

- \( P(E|H_1) \) is likely high because Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(E|H_1) = 0.70 \).
- \( P(E|H_2) \) is likely moderate because Adam's problem-solving skills and intelligence fit computer science, but the nature-related curiosity and love for animals are less typical. Let's assume \( P(E|H_2) = 0.30 \).

For \( P(E|\neg H_1) \) and \( P(E|\neg H_2) \):

- \( P(E|\neg H_1) \) would be lower as Adamâ€™s personality sketch fits agricultural and veterinary science. Let's approximate \( P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.20 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_2) \) would be higher, as many non-computer science students could fit the given personality, especially those in biological sciences or psychology. Let's approximate \( P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.60 \).


	using Bayes' rule for both fields:

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1)P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1)P(\neg H_1) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.70 \cdot 0.05 + 0.20 \cdot 0.95 = 0.035 + 0.190 = 0.225 \]

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.05}{0.225} = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \approx 0.156 \]

For computer science:

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2)P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + P(E|\neg H_2)P(\neg H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.30 \cdot 0.20 + 0.60 \cdot 0.80 = 0.060 + 0.480 = 0.540 \]

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{0.540} = \frac{0.060}{0.540} \approx 0.111 \]

Thus, the values are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.156,
  "computer science": 0.111
