To use Bayes' rule, we need to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \). Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to estimate the following for each field:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches, given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches, given that he was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.

Let's assign some reasonable estimates for these probabilities:

### Computer Science:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is moderate, given that it's a common graduate field.
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given the sketch, computer science students can have a range of personalities, but his love for nature, plants, and animals may not align perfectly with typical traits of a computer science student. However, his intelligence and problem-solving skills could match.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \)

3. **Likelihood of evidence given not-H \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This should be estimated based on other fields, but we can assume itâ€™s a bit more common overall.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: This is probably lower than computer science considering there are fewer students typically in this field.
   - \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given his traits, this is a very suitable match.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.8 \)

3. **Likelihood of evidence given not-H \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For not being in this field, it's probably less likely compared to the specific field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.3 \)

### Normalizing Constant \( P(E) \):

The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch can be estimated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{CS}})) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot (1 - P(H_{\text{AgVet}}))  \]

Simplifying \( P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.3 + 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7 \approx 0.38 \)

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities:

For Computer Science:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.38} \approx 0.237 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.38} \approx 0.211 \]

So the resulting probabilities that Adam was enrolled in these specific fields given his personality sketch are:

{
  "computer science": 0.237,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.211
}
