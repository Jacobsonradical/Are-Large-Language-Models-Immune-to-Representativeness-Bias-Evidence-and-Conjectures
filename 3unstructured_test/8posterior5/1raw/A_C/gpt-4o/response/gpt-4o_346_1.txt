To calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, let's denote \( H_{\text{cs}} \) for Computer Science and \( H_{\text{agvet}} \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Here’s how we can break it down:

### Computer Science

**P(H):** The prior probability, \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \), is the general likelihood that a random graduate student is in Computer Science. Let's assume this is a moderately common field among graduate students, so we might assign it a value of 0.2 (20%).

**P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam having the personality traits given that he is in Computer Science. Because Adam’s traits include solving puzzles and high intelligence, which are relevant to Computer Science, we might assign this a moderately high value, such as 0.5.

**P(E|¬H):** The likelihood that a student not in Computer Science has Adam’s traits. Given that these traits are fairly common for any intelligent, curious individual, we might assign this a value of 0.3.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H):** The prior probability, \( P(H_{\text{agvet}}) \), is the general likelihood that a random graduate student is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, which might be less common. We might assign it a value of 0.1 (10%).

**P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam having the personality traits given that he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Because of Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals, we'd assign this a higher value, such as 0.7.

**P(E|¬H):** The likelihood that a student not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science has Adam’s traits. As before, we might use the same 0.3.

To compute \( P(H|E) \), we need \( P(E) \), the total probability of Adam’s traits. 

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agvet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agvet}}) + \text{(other fields)} \]

For simplicity, let's calculate the partial total probability \( P(E) \) for just these two fields:

\[ 
P(E) \approx (0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + \text{(contributions from other unspecified fields)} 
\approx 0.1 + 0.07 
\approx 0.17 \]

Now, use Bayes' Rule for each field:

### For Computer Science

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.17} \approx 0.588 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H_{\text{agvet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agvet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agvet}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.17} \approx 0.412 \]

Therefore, here are the computed probabilities:

  "computer science": 0.588,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.412
