To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field, given his personality sketch, we will approach the problem using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality characteristics.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality characteristics given that he was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing Adam's personality characteristics, regardless of the field.

We don't have exact figures for some of these probabilities, so we'll make logical estimates based on the provided sketch and general knowledge.

### Computer Science

**P(H):** Generally speaking, computer science is a popular graduate field. Let's assume a prior probability \( P(H) \) of 0.2.

**P(E|H):** Given Adam's characteristics, he enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, both of which align well with computer science. Thus, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) at 0.4.

**P(E|\neg H):** Since there are other fields that might also align with his personality traits (such as mathematics, physics), let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) at around 0.1.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H):** Agricultural and veterinary science might not be as common as computer science for graduate students, so let's estimate \( P(H) \) at 0.05.

**P(E|H):** Adam's empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work fit very well with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, we might rate \( P(E|H) \) at 0.7.

**P(E|\neg H):** Given the distinctiveness of this field concerning Adam's traits, let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \) at around 0.1.

### Calculations

Using Bayes' rule, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):

#### Computer Science

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{(0.4 \times 0.2 + 0.1 \times 0.8)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.08} 
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.16}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = 0.5
\]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{(0.7 \times 0.05 + 0.1 \times 0.95)} 
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.095}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.13}
\]
\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.27
\]
