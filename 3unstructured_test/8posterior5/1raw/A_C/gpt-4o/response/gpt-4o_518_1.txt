To solve this, let's break down the problem using Bayesian inference. We need to use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify, we're given two hypotheses (\( H \)) â€” Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, or Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Let's assign some reasonable probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given the specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given any other field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be inferred from the likelihoods and prior probabilities of all possible fields.

Given the personality sketch:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Based on these, we assign the probabilities for each field:

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
  - \( P(H_{\text{agro/vet}}) \): Since Adam has a strong interest in nature and animals, we can assume a relatively high prior probability (e.g., 0.3).
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{agro/vet}}) \): Given the personality sketch, this is likely relatively high (e.g., 0.8).
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agro/vet}}) \): This would be lower, as the personality is more closely aligned with agricultural and veterinary science (e.g., 0.4).

- **Computer science**:
  - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): This field is common but not as aligned with the natural sciences aspect of Adam's personality (e.g., 0.2).
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Given Adam's high intelligence and problem-solving skills, this is plausible but not as high (e.g., 0.5).
  - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): This would still be moderate due to the broad nature of other fields (e.g., 0.6).

Now we calculate \( P(H|E) \) using these values:

### Agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(H_{\text{agro/vet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agro/vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agro/vet}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agro/vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agro/vet}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + \ldots \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \times 0.3) + (0.5 \times 0.2) + \ldots \approx 0.24 + 0.1 = 0.34 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agro/vet}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{0.34} \approx 0.71 \]

### Computer science:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.29 \]

Combining these results:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.71,
  "computer science": 0.29
