To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch \( E \)), we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) (the total probability of the personality sketch \( E \)) is a constant for all hypotheses and will normalize the results, we can focus on the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for comparative purposes.

### Hypothesis: Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Let's assume a moderate prior, say \( 0.25 \) (since computer science is a popular field).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in Computer Science. Given his interest in puzzles and high intelligence, this might be somewhat likely, say \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing \( E \) given that Adam is not in computer science. This could be influenced by the remaining fields, but let's assume \( 0.1 \) (default value if evenly distributed).

### Hypothesis: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Letâ€™s assume a somewhat lower prior due to fewer students in this field, say \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given his curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, this is quite high, say \( 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): As above, still assuming \( 0.1 \).

Since \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the same in both cases, it simplifies the calculation comparison:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}| E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}| E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.07}{P(E)} \]

Hence, the relative comparison (up to normalization by \( P(E) \)) would be:

{
  "computer science": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07
}

Note that these are normalized so their relative scale is consistent. Full normalization would require summing these and converting into probabilities between 0 and 1 which sum to 1. However, as requested, the values do not necessarily need to sum to 1 as we are excluding other fields.
