To compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in the respective field given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields, it suffices to compare \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \). We will assume arbitrary but reasonable values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: 
   - Let’s assume the prior probability that a student chooses agricultural and veterinary science is moderate, considering the specific interest in plants and animals.
   - \( P(H) = 0.1 \)

2. **Conditional Probability, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, he is highly likely to be in this field.
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \)

3. **Conditional Probability, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - The probability of the personality traits \( E \) occurring if Adam is not in this field could be lower but still possible.
   - Let \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)

Now, calculating \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assuming the prior probability for a graduate student choosing computer science is higher given the field’s popularity.
   - \( P(H) = 0.3 \)

2. **Conditional Probability, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking skills, he might also fit into computer science, though his interest in nature and animals is less directly related.
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \)

3. **Conditional Probability, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - The probability of the personality traits \( E \) occurring if Adam is not in this field is reasonably high, considering these traits are somewhat common.
   - Let \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \)

Now, calculating \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]

### Summary

Based on the above computations, the relative probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:

```
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.12
}
```

These values suggest that, while Adam’s personality traits are a strong fit for agricultural and veterinary science, the higher prior probability of students enrolling in computer science makes it a slightly more likely field for him, given the information at hand.
