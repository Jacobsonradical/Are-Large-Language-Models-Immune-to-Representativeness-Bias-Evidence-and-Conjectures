Alright, let's go through the analysis step-by-step for each field using the information provided:

### For Computer Science:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. We'll assume there's a moderate level of students in computer science, so let's take P(H) ≈ 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was in computer science.
    - Curiosity about nature and plants: Neutral to slightly less likely.
    - Enjoys solving puzzles: High likelihood.
    - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Neutral, can apply to any field.
    - High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: High likelihood.
    - Appreciation for hard work: Neutral.

    Combining these, we estimate P(E|H) ≈ 0.4 (40%).

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not in computer science. For students outside this field, the combination of attributes might also fit a broad range of other disciplines, perhaps more so than computer science.

    We take P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.5 (50%).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.4)(0.2) + (0.5)(0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.4 = 0.48 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.4)(0.2)}{0.48} \approx 0.167 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming fewer students are in this field compared to computer science, let's take P(H) ≈ 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - Curiosity about nature and plants: High likelihood.
    - Enjoys solving puzzles: Neutral to slightly positive.
    - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: High likelihood.
    - High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: Neutral to positive.
    - Appreciation for hard work: High likelihood.

    Combining these, we estimate P(E|H) ≈ 0.7 (70%).

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not in agricultural and veterinary science. We consider this to be the same as in the first case for non-target fields.

    We take P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.5 (50%).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7)(0.1) + (0.5)(0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.45 = 0.52 \]

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.7)(0.1)}{0.52} \approx 0.135 \]

Finally, we compile our results in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": 0.167,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.135
}

These values indicate the posterior probabilities that Adam is enrolled in each respective field given the personality sketch.
