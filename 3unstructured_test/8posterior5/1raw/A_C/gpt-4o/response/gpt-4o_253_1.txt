To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E| \neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Using these, we can then compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expressed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

However, since we're interested in comparing the relative likelihoods of Adam being in each field, we can simplify by considering the ratios and avoiding absolute calculation of \( P(E) \).

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior likelihood that Adam is enrolled in computer science might be moderate, given that computer science is a common field for graduate studies.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which are typical traits associated with computer science students, this probability might be relatively high.
3. **P(E| \neg H)**: Traits associated with Adam (interest in nature, empathy, love for animals) might be less common in computer science, but not impossible, so this probability might be moderate.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior likelihood that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate to low, given that it’s a less common choice for graduate students overall.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, it is very high that these traits fit well within agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **P(E| \neg H)**: These traits are less likely to correspond with fields other than agricultural and veterinary science; hence this probability is low.

### Estimation:
Let's assume:
- For computer science:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \)
  - \( P(E| \neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)
  - \( P(E| \neg H) \approx 0.1 \)

Using Bayes' rule, we get roughly:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.357,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.474
}
```

Explanation:
- For computer science:
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.385 \]

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.1 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.09}{0.18} = 0.5 \]

These values are rough estimations and may change based on more precise prior probabilities.
