To assess the probability that Adam was enrolled in either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "computer science", we need to use Bayes' theorem. It's given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of Adam's personality sketch.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.

Given the lack of specific data, we will make some reasoned estimates. Assume the relative enrollment probabilities (priors) for the fields, the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given the field, and the total probability of the personality sketch.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Priors:
- \( P(H) \) (Probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science): Assume 0.05 as a rough estimate.

#### Likelihood of the evidence:
- \( P(E|H) \) (Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he's in agricultural and veterinary science): Given his love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, this is quite high. Let's say 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science): Given Adam's traits could fit into various fields, assume 0.1.

### 2. Computer Science

#### Priors:
- \( P(H) \): Assume this is more common. Let's say 0.1.

#### Likelihood of the evidence:
- \( P(E|H) \): Given his abstract thinking and puzzle-solving interests, let's say 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): As noted, Adam's traits could fit into numerous fields, assume 0.05.

### Computing Posterior Probabilities (assuming \( P(E) \approx P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \))

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) = (0.3 \times 0.1) + (0.05 \times 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.045 = 0.075 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.075} = 0.4 \]

So given the information and our assumptions:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

### Note:
These values are based on rough estimates and assumptions. In practice, more precise priors and likelihoods based on actual data would refine these probabilities.
