Let's break down the probability calculations step-by-step for each field.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. This can be estimated based on the general distribution of graduate students across fields, but without exact data, we might make a rough estimate.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given Adam is in computer science.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing E given Adam is not in computer science.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science given E (calculated using Bayes' theorem).

#### Judgments for Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: Since computer science is a popular field, let's assume P(H) ≈ 0.2 (20%).
- **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam's qualities (curiosity, intelligence, problem-solving) could fit well within computer science, but his love for nature and animals isn't directly relevant, we might put P(E|H) ≈ 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Given Adam's qualities, it's more likely they fit fields more oriented towards nature and animals, hence P(E|\neg H) might be roughly 0.7.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.56 = 0.62 \]

Then:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.62} = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \approx 0.097 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given this field is less common than computer science but more aligned with Adam's qualities.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E given Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing E given Adam is not in this field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in this field given E.

#### Judgments for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: Less common than computer science, let's assume P(H) ≈ 0.1 (10%).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's qualities are more aligned, we might put P(E|H) ≈ 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Less likely given these relevant qualities, let's put P(E|\neg H) ≈ 0.4.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.36 = 0.44 \]

Then:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.44} = \frac{0.08}{0.44} \approx 0.182 \]

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.097,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.182
}
```

These values represent the estimated posterior probabilities that Adam is enrolled in computer science or agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch and using Bayesian inference.
