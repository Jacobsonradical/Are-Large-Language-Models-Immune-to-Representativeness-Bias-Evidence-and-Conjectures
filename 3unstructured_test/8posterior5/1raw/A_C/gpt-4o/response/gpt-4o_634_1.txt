To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to make some subjective assessments for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then we use Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and will be the same for each field, it suffices to compare the numerators \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) across the fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Estimates:
- **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for Adam being in this field is moderate given the description, say 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's personality sketch fits well with agricultural and veterinary science given his love for animals and nature, say 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits if he were not in agricultural and veterinary science might be somewhat lower, given how well the traits align with this field, say 0.3.

\[ P(H|E)_\text{agricultural and veterinary science} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Computer Science

#### Estimates:
- **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for Adam being in this field is higher, given the prevalence of computer science graduate students, say 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: Adamâ€™s intelligence and problem-solving skills could fit well in computer science, but his love for animals and nature might not be as relevant, say 0.3.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's traits if he were not in computer science might be quite similar because his traits don't strongly indicate computer science specifically, say 0.4.

\[ P(H|E)_\text{computer science} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

### Normalized Posterior Probabilities:

Since we are working with proportional values, we'll compare the numerators directly:

For agricultural and veterinary science: 0.08  
For computer science: 0.06

### Summary:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.06
}
\]

These are not normalized posterior probabilities but rather indicate relative plausibility based on the subjective estimates provided.
