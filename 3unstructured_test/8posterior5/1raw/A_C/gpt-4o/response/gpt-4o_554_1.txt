To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch E of Adam, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the fields "agricultural and veterinary science" and "computer science", let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

We need to estimate:

- \( P(H_1) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_2) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_1) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_2) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_1) \) and \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in those fields.

For simplicity, let's assume the following values based on the given personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

- \( P(H_1) \): Let's assume the prior probability is 0.1, reflecting that it’s a somewhat specialized field.
- \( P(E|H_1) \): Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and a warm heart, the likelihood is high, say 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): For simplicity, we assume the likelihood of \( E \) given that Adam was not in this field is lower, say 0.2.

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) \] can be taken as a normalizing constant, but since we are interested in relative probabilities, we can focus on the numerator.

2. **Computer Science**:

- \( P(H_2) \): Let’s assume a higher prior probability, say 0.2, considering the popularity of the field.
- \( P(E|H_2) \): Given Adam's intelligence and interest in puzzles, the likelihood is moderate, say 0.5.
- \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): For simplicity, we assume the likelihood of \( E \) given that Adam was not in this field is slightly higher, say 0.3.

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]

Now, let's compute the relative values:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same in both calculations and it will cancel out when comparing relative probabilities, we can compare the numerators directly.

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \)
- For Computer Science: \( 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \)

So in relative terms, the computed posteriors would be (roughly):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.1
}
```

This implies that, based on the provided personality sketch, Adam is slightly more likely to be enrolled in computer science, but there is a non-negligible chance he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
