To use Bayes' rule effectively, we need an understanding of several probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field, agnostic of the personality sketch.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that particular field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.

Let's proceed with estimates:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this at 0.05 as a rough guess based on general graduate field distributions.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality sketch if he is in this field. Given his genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals, this seems quite compatible. Let's set this high, at 0.8.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch if he is not enrolled in this field. While many other fields could also match his qualities to some extent, not all would fit perfectly. Let's set a moderate likelihood, 0.3.

Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.285 = 0.325 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.325} \approx 0.123 \]

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. We start with a slightly higher probability here, say 0.15, owing to the popularity and broad applicability of this field.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality sketch if he is in this field. While his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills match, his strong affinity for nature and animals is less directly related. Set it lower, at 0.3.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch if he is not enrolled in this field. Let's assume the same value as in the previous case, 0.3.

Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.85) = 0.045 + 0.255 = 0.3 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.3} = 0.15 \]

Putting these together:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.123,
