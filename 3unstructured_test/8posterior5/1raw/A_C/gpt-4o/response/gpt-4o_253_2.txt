To calculate the probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we will use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, because the denominator \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields, we can compare the relative probabilities (i.e., it's sufficient to calculate the proportional values without normalizing). Let's assume plausible values for these probabilities based on the given personality sketch.

Let's assign the following probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):**

   - Assume \(P(H)\) for computer science (CS) is 0.2.
   - Assume \(P(H)\) for agricultural and veterinary science (AVS) is 0.05.
   
   These values reflect general enrollment rates in graduate programs, noting that computer science is a widely chosen field.

2. **Conditional Probability \(P(E|H)\):**

   - For CS: Considering the interest in nature, curiosity, abstract concepts, and problem-solving, let's assume \(P(E|H)\) = 0.3.
   - For AVS: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, \(P(E|H)\) = 0.7.

3. **Conditional Probability \(P(E|\neg H)\):**

   - For CS: Curiosity about nature and empathy might be less common in CS students, so \(P(E|\neg CS)\) is lower, let's assume 0.1.
   - For AVS: Students not in this field will less likely fit the profile, so \(P(E|\neg AVS)\) is lower, let's assume 0.3.
   
Given these values, we can now calculate \(P(H|E)\) proportionally.

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

For computer science:

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06
\]

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035
\]

Normalizing these values to get \(P(H_{CS}|E)\) and \(P(H_{AVS}|E)\):

\[
\text{Normalization Factor} = 0.06 + 0.035 = 0.095
\]

Now,

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.095} \approx 0.632
\]
\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.095} \approx 0.368
\]

Thus, the probability estimates are:

\[
\{
  "computer science": 0.632,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.368
\}
\]
