To apply Bayes' rule for the given fields and compute the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field based on the personality sketch, we'll need to:

1. Determine the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field.
2. Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field given the personality sketch.
3. Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) for the fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor and is the same for both fields, we can simplify to:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We'll need to make some reasonable assumptions about these probabilities based on the personality sketch and the typical characteristics associated with each field.

### Computer Science
1. **P(H):** Computer Science is a very popular graduate field, so let's assume a moderate prior probability.
   \[ P(\text{CS}) = 0.3 \]

2. **P(E|H):** Adam's love for nature, animals, and his empathy might not be as common in computer science, but his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well.
   \[ P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.5 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of the personality sketch being true for someone not in computer science. Given the plethora of other fields, we assume this to be more evenly distributed.
   \[ P(E|\neg \text{CS}) = 0.2 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H):** This is a more specialized field, so let's assign a lower prior probability compared to computer science.
   \[ P(\text{Ag-Vet}) = 0.1 \]

2. **P(E|H):** Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy highly align with agricultural and veterinary sciences.
   \[ P(E|\text{Ag-Vet}) = 0.9 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Again, the probability of the personality sketch being true for someone not in agricultural and veterinary sciences is distributed among many fields.
   \[ P(E|\neg \text{Ag-Vet}) = 0.3 \]

### Computing Posterior Probabilities

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \propto P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) = 0.5 \cdot 0.3 = 0.15 \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\text{Ag-Vet}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Ag-Vet}) \cdot P(\text{Ag-Vet}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

### Normalizing to Conditional Probabilities

To find the actual probabilities, we should normalize these values, but since the sum does not need to be 1 due to other possible fields, we leave them as is.

Here's the formatted response:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09
}
```

Note: These probabilities are approximations and depend on the subjective interpretation of the given personality sketch relative to the fields.
