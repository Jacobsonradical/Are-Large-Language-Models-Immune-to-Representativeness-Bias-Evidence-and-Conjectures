To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of enrolling in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in the field.

We will provide rough estimates for these probabilities since specific statistical data is not provided.

### Computer Science

1. **\(P(H)\)**: Letâ€™s assume that the prior probability of Adam being in a computer science program is roughly average for a graduate student in the U.S.
   
   \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: The characteristics in E don't highly correlate with typical computer science students, though high intelligence and abstract thinking might be relevant.

   \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \).

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: If Adam is not in computer science, the probability of E could be spread over various other disciplines. 

   \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.5 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\(P(H)\)**: The prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science is generally lower compared to more popular fields like computer science. 

   \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.1 \).

2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: E strongly correlates with characteristics typical of someone in agricultural and veterinary science (interest in nature, plants, and animals).

   \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.8 \).

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: If Adam is not in this field, the probability of E could be lower as these interests are highly specific.

   \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.3 \).

Next, we use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's do the calculations:

### Computer Science:

\[ P(E_{\text{CS}}) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times 0.8) \]
\[ = 0.06 + 0.4 \approx 0.46 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.46} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.06}{0.46} \approx 0.13 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(E_{\text{AVS}}) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) \]
\[ = 0.08 + 0.27 \approx 0.35 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.35} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.23 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.13,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.23
}
```

These values suggest that, given the personality sketch \( E \), Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science.
