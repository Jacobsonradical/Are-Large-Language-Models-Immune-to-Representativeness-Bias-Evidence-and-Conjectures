To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we'll need to estimate the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the given field.

We can then calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across different fields for the given \( E \), we are interested in the relative likelihoods.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): Let's say the baseline probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low, so we might estimate it at 0.05.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given the traits about Adam (love for nature, plants, and animals), the probability that he is in this field is quite high, say 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the described personality traits occurring in a student not in this field is likely lower, say 0.1.

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): The baseline probability that a random graduate student is in computer science is higher given the popularity of the field, let's estimate it at 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's interests and traits, it is less likely but still possible he is in computer science, so we might estimate this at 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The described traits are still likely, but less specific, so let's say 0.15.

Now compute \( P(H|E) \).

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

**For Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Now normalize these values to get relative probabilities.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\frac{0.04}{0.04+0.06} = 0.4\),
  "computer science": \(\frac{0.06}{0.04+0.06} = 0.6\)
}

This indicates the relative probability that Adam is enrolled in one field versus the other given the personality sketch \( E \). These values are based on estimations and should be interpreted accordingly.
