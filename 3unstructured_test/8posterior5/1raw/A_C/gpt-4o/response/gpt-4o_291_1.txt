To use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis's negation \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's assess these probabilities for the two fields in question.

For simplicity, we will make some reasonable assumptions based on the given information and the nature of graduate studies in these fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** Let's assume that the chance of a graduate student in the U.S. being in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low because it is a specialized field.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, the likelihood that this personality sketch fits someone in agricultural and veterinary science is high.
3. **Likelihood of Evidence Given Negation \( P(E|\neg H) \):** Given the broader range of other fields, including many that may not closely align with Adam's interests, this probability is lower.

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** Considering the popularity and broad applications of computer science, the prior probability of a graduate student being in this field is relatively high.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Given Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts, there's a moderate fit; however, his strong interest in nature and animals might not resonate as strongly with computer science.
3. **Likelihood of Evidence Given Negation \( P(E|\neg H) \):** Given that computer science is just one of many non-aligned fields, this probability might also be relatively high.

Without explicit numerical values, we will make qualitative judgments to assign rough probabilities:

| Field                          | P(H)   | P(E|H) | P(E|\neg H) |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| Agricultural and Veterinary Science | 0.05  | 0.8    | 0.4         |
| Computer Science               | 0.3    | 0.5    | 0.6         |

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and can be normalized later, the relative values suffice to compare:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri}} \propto 0.8 \times 0.05 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} \propto 0.5 \times 0.3 \]

Let's compute:

- \( P(H|E)_{\text{agri}} \propto 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \)
- \( P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} \propto 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.15 \)

To convert these proportional values to probabilities, we can normalize them by their sum:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri}} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.15} \approx 0.21 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{0.15}{0.04 + 0.15} \approx 0.79 \]

Thus, we obtain the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.21,
  "computer science": 0.79
}
```

These results suggest that, even though Adam's personality aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science, the sheer prevalence and moderate fit of computer science result in a higher probability for the latter, given the provided sketch.
