To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' Rule, we need estimates for the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of E given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of E given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of E, which we can derive from the law of total probability:  
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

The Bayes' Rule formula:  
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Now let's estimate these probabilities for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: This field is relatively common among those with a genuine curiosity about nature and animals, so let's estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.1.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given the personality sketch of Adam, it is very likely he fits well in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.8.
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For simplicity, let’s assume that in fields not closely related to nature and animals, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).
4. **Overall \( P(E) \)**: Using the total probability, assuming there are many other fields Adam might be enrolled in, let’s use it to approximate \( P(E) \):

   \( P(E) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.26 \)

Combining these:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \approx 0.3077 \]

### Computer Science
1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a common field for intelligent individuals who enjoy puzzles, so let's estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.2.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, but only some aspects of his personality fit clearly with computer science, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.5.
3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For other fields, still using \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).
4. **Overall \( P(E) \)**: Using the total probability with the updated prior,

   \( P(E) \approx 0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8 = 0.26 \) (similar to above)

Combining these:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.3846 \]

### Final Results
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077,
  "computer science": 0.3846
}
```

These probabilities suggest that given the personality sketch of Adam, it is slightly more likely he would be in computer science than in agricultural and veterinary science.
