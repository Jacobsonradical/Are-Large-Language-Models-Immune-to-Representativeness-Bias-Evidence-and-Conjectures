To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a particular field, given his personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

First, we need to judge the following for both fields:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in that field.

Then using Bayes' rule, we can compute \( P(H|E) \).

Let's assume the following reasonable values based on the description:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - Prior probability \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) \): Given Adam's characteristics align well with this field, we might assign a moderately high prior, say, \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.2 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \): Adam's interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals strongly suggest this field, so we set \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.8 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) \): Adam's characteristics are somewhat common but not so strongly indicating exclusion from this field, let's say \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) = 0.3 \).

2. **Computer Science**
   - Prior probability \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): Given the high number of graduate students in this field, we might assign a reasonable middle prior, say, \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.2 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): While some of Adam's traits (e.g., high intelligence, abstract thinking) align with this field, other traits (nature, animals) do not strongly, so \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.2 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \): Given Adam's characteristics are somewhat generic to exclude this field, let's again use \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.3 \).

Next, to compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:
- Compute the normalization constant \( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}}) + P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).
  
This constant ensures that probabilities sum to 1 over all hypotheses and the negation of the hypotheses. For simplicity, assume the prior for all other fields together, \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H_{\text{ag}}) - P(H_{\text{cs}}) \).

Using these values, we can now calculate:

1. For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}})}{P(E)}
   \]

2. For **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)}
   \]

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5333,  // Example value, actual calculation necessary
  "computer science": 0.1   // Example value, actual calculation necessary
}
```

However, if more precision is required, you can calculate the exact values with the accurate fraction: 

1. \( P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{ (0.8 \times 0.2) + (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.6)} \)
2. \( P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{ (0.8 \times 0.2) + (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.6)} \)

Simplifying calculations yield:
\[
P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) \approx \frac{0.16}{0.46} \approx 0.3478
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.46} \approx 0.087 \ 
\]

Thus,

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3478,
  "computer science": 0.087
}
```
