To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field—computer science and agricultural and veterinary science—we need to apply Bayes' rule. Here is a systematic approach:

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood that Adam has the personality sketch \( E \) given he was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood that Adam has the personality sketch \( E \) given he was not enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability that Adam has the personality sketch \( E \).

Given the personality sketch:
- Adam has a deep love for nature and animals, empathy, and an appreciation for hard work, suggesting fields related to nature and animals might have a higher likelihood.
- Adam is highly intelligent and enjoys solving puzzles, suggesting that fields requiring problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts are relevant.
- Adam was a graduate student in the U.S., suggesting a reasonably wide range of possible fields.

Let's assume generic and somewhat arbitrary prior probabilities based on common graduate fields in the U.S.:

1. \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \)
2. \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.05 \)

Now let's judge the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

1. For computer science:
   - Interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts are high matches.
   - Curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are less frequent but not irrelevant.
   - Estimate \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \).

2. For agricultural and veterinary science:
   - Curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation of hard work are highly relevant.
   - Intelligence and problem-solving skills also valuable but secondary.
   - Estimate \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.7 \).

Now let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \):

1. \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \): Considering a non-computer science field, matching the given sketch could reasonably be around:
   - Estimate \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.2 \).

2. \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): For non-agricultural/veterinary science fields, given that nature and animal orientations might be less common:
   - Estimate \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \).

Now we need to compute the overall probabilities:

1. For computer science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{computer science})} \]
\[ = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times (1 - 0.2)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.16} \]
\[ = \frac{0.06}{0.22} \]
\[ \approx 0.273 \]

2. For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science})} \]
\[ = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.7 \times 0.05 + 0.1 \times (1 - 0.05)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.095} \]
\[ = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \]
\[ \approx 0.269 \]

Therefore:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.273,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.269
}
