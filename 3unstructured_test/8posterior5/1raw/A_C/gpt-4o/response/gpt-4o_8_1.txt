To evaluate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses \( H = \) "Adam was enrolled in \( \text{agricultural and veterinary science} \)" and \( H = \) "Adam was enrolled in \( \text{computer science} \)", we will use Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let’s assume graduate students are equally distributed across different fields. However, considering Adam’s traits which align well with agricultural and veterinary science, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication align strongly with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is trickier. If Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, his traits might still be present but less common. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' Rule: 
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.15 = 0.105 \]

### For Computer Science:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let's again assume equal distribution, but considering Adam's fit here seems less intuitive, we will use \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s intelligence and love for solving puzzles match well with a field such as computer science, but his other traits fit less well. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given he is not in computer science, Adam's traits wouldn't be significantly less likely in other fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04 \]

### Conclusion:

Combining the calculations, we have the following probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.105,
  "computer science": 0.04
}
```

Please note that these values are subjective and depend on the assumed priors and likelihoods. Adjustments to these assumptions could change the resulting probabilities.
