Let's evaluate the given parameters for each of the fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** The probability that any given graduate student is in this field. Agriculture and veterinary science are specialized fields, so not all graduate students choose these. We might estimate this to be moderate. Let's assume it's about 0.10 for graduate students. 

- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, and animals, which aligns closely with this field. We can assume this is fairly high, say 0.80.

- **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that the description does not align as closely with most other fields, this could be lower. Let's estimate this to be about 0.30.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \)

Calculations:
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.10) + (0.30 \times 0.90) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.10}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** The probability that any given graduate student is in computer science. Computer science is a very popular field, so this probability is likely higher. Assume it's about 0.20.

- **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in computer science. Some aspects such as being quiet, enjoying solving puzzles, and high intelligence may fit, but the deep love for nature and animals is less typical. Estimate this to be moderate, around 0.40.

- **P(E|¬H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in computer science. Given the diversity of other fields, this might not change much from the agricultural and veterinary science case. Let's keep this at 0.30.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(E) = (0.40 \times 0.20) + (0.30 \times 0.80) = 0.08 + 0.24 = 0.32 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.40 \times 0.20}{0.32} = 0.25 \]

Based on the calculations, here is the result:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
