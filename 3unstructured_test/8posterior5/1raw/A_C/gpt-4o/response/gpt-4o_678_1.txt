To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we're comparing the likelihood of Adam being in two specific fields (computer science and agricultural and veterinary science), we don't need the exact value of \( P(E) \), as it will be the same for both fields and thus cancel out in the comparison. We'll focus on calculating the relative probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

We'll estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) based on how well the personality sketch of Adam correlates with the fields mentioned.

### For Computer Science:
- **P(H):** Relatively high given the popularity of the field for high intelligence and abstract thinking. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
- **P(E|H):** Lower, as the personality sketch mentions a love for nature, empathy, and a connection to animals, which are less associated with computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Empathy and a love for nature are relatively common traits that could be expected outside computer science. We'd assume a high probability. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H):** Moderately high, as this field aligns well with Adam's interests. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H):** Very high, as the sketch fits perfectly with traits required in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Again, relatively common, though slightly less so than with computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Now, let's compare the two relative probabilities:

### Computer Science:
\[ \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} = \frac{0.025}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a common term and will cancel out, the relative probabilities indicate that Adam is more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch.

Thus, we can summarize our results as:

{
  "computer science": 0.025,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
