To apply Bayesian inference, we'll start by estimating the probabilities in the following way:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given the hypothesis that he was enrolled in the given field.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the evidence given that he was not enrolled in the given field.
- \(P(H|E)\): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given the evidence.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\(P(H)\)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Since this is one of many potential fields, we might start with a low value but higher than some fields due to his strong interest in nature and animals.
   - Estimate: \(P(H) = 0.05\)

2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, these traits strongly align with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Estimate: \(P(E|H) = 0.8\)

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - While his traits are not exclusive to this field, they do align well with it, so they are less likely to be observed in unrelated fields.
   - Estimate: \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.95}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \approx 0.174
\]

### Computer Science

1. **\(P(H)\)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - Computer science is a popular field, but it doesn't align as well with Adam's interests in nature and animals.
   - Estimate: \(P(H) = 0.10\)

2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were enrolled in computer science.
   - Some of Adam's traits, such as high intelligence and puzzle-solving ability, are relevant to computer science.
   - Estimate: \(P(E|H) = 0.6\)

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were not enrolled in computer science.
   - While these traits are common among computer science students, they are also found in many other fields.
   - Estimate: \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.4\)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.10}{0.6 \times 0.10 + 0.4 \times 0.90}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.36}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.42} \approx 0.143
\]

Now we format the answer:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "computer science": 0.143
}
