To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field (before considering the personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field given the personality sketch E, which we can calculate using Bayes' Rule.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) can be further broken down using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H) \]

However, without concrete data for all possible fields, we need to use reasonable assumptions and intuitive insights. We'll assume reasonable estimations for these probabilities based on the given personality sketch.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): While we don't have precise numbers, let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (since there are many fields of study).
- \( P(E|H) \): Considering Adam's deep love for animals and appreciation for nature, we can assume a high likelihood, say \( 0.6 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that someone not in agricultural and veterinary science fits this profile might be moderate, say \( 0.3 \).

### For Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): Likewise, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Considering Adam is good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, let's assume a moderate likelihood, say \( 0.5 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that someone not in computer science fits this profile might also be moderate, say \( 0.3 \).

Now, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (denoted as AV):
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) + P(E|\neg H_{AV}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AV}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.06 + 0.27 = 0.33 \]

\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.33} \approx 0.18 \]

#### For Computer Science (denoted as CS):
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.05 + 0.27 = 0.32 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.32} \approx 0.156 \]

Combining the results:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.18",
  "computer science": "0.156"
}

These values give us an understanding of the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in each respective field given his personality sketch.
