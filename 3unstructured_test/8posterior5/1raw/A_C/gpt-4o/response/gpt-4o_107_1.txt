Sure, let's evaluate the different fields and calculate the probabilities.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student. While the exact probability can vary, let's reasonably estimate this as 0.05 (5%) based on the general distribution of graduate students across various fields.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is indeed studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, this would be quite high. Let's estimate this as 0.8 (80%).
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is not studying agricultural and veterinary science. Since empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature could still fit other fields but less directly, let's estimate this as 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.95} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.19} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.174 \]

### For Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science as a graduate student. This field is more popular, so let's estimate this as 0.1 (10%).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is studying computer science. His intelligence and puzzle-solving skills fit well, but his love for nature and animals is less aligned. Let's estimate this as 0.3 (30%).
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is not studying computer science. Considering the previous consideration, let's keep this consistent at around 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.3 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.18} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.21} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.143 \]

Therefore, the answers are:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
