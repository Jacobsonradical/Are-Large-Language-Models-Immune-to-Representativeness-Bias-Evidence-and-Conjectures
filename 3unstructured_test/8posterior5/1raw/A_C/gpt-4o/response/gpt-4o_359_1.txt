To estimate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood under the negation \( P(E|\neg H) \). Let's work through this:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - **P(H)**: The prior probability. Let's assume generally that a small but notable percentage of graduate students might be in this field. For simplicity, let's set this around 0.1.
    - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch fits if he were in this field. Given his love for nature, animals, and plants, this seems quite high. Let's approximate this as 0.8.
    - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood regardless of this specific field. Given he could fit into other areas that involve nature or puzzles, let's assume this to be moderately low, around 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.27} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
    - **P(H)**: The prior probability. Computer science is a very common field, so let’s consider it higher, around 0.2.
    - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch fits if he were in this field. With his intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and abstract thinking, this is plausible but less aligned with his nature and animal interests. Let's estimate this as 0.5.
    - **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood regardless of this field. Given the general attributes making him suitable for other fields, this might be slightly higher, around 0.6.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.48} = \frac{0.1}{0.58} \approx 0.172 \]

So in summary:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "computer science": 0.172
