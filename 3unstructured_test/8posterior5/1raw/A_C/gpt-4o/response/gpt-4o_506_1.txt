To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) via Bayes' Theorem for each field, we need to judge \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence (which can be considered as a normalization constant here).

Let's start with reasonable assumptions:

### Computer Science
- **P(H):** Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. According to typical distributions of graduate students, let's assume \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \) (CS is a popular field, but not overwhelmingly dominant).
- **P(E|H):** Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were in the computer science field. Given his strong abstract thinking and intelligence, this might be moderately high. Let's assume \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of observing the personality traits of Adam if he were not in computer science. Given these traits are somewhat neutral and could apply to many fields, let's assume \( P(E|\neg \text{computer science}) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.2} = 0.3 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H):** Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common compared to CS, let's assume \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H):** Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and his love for animals, this likelihood should be high. Let's assume \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.7 \).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Probability of observing Adam's traits if he were not in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.1} = 0.7 \]

Resulting probabilities:
