To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we'll use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is not in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence.

For this problem, \( P(E) \) can be considered as a normalization constant and thus doesn't need to be explicitly calculated for the relative comparison between fields.

We'll estimate \( P(H) \) based on general knowledge about graduate students in the U.S., and then use the information provided about Adam to estimate \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \) for Computer Science: Moderate, given the popularity of the field. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's characteristics like high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles align with computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): There are many other fields where his characteristics apply, so let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Less common, but fits well with Adam's love for nature and animals. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's characteristics, especially his genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals, match this field very well. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The characteristics are less common for those not in this field but still possible in other disciplines. Letâ€™s assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.05 = 0.035 \]

Now, we can present the relative probabilities as follows (normalized values would sum to 1 but here we'll present them as calculated relative weights):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.035
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood that Adam is in computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary science, based on the provided personality sketch. However, the specific field specialization outside these two can also play a significant role in Adam's profile.
