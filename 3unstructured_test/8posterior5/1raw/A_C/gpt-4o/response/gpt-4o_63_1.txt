To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to determine the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.

Then, we can compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Given the personality sketch of Adam and general knowledge, let's assign some estimated values:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)** - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary science:
   - This could be relatively low but not negligible, as it's a specific field compared to more common fields like computer science.
   - Estimate: \( P(H)_{AVS} = 0.05 \)

2. **\( P(E|H) \)** - The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary science:
   - Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, combined with empathy and dedication, aligns well with this field.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H)_{AVS} = 0.8 \)
   
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)** - The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary science:
   - While Adam's traits can fit other fields, they are particularly strong for this one.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H)_{AVS} = 0.2 \)

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)** - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science:
   - This is higher because computer science is a very common field of study.
   - Estimate: \( P(H)_{CS} = 0.2 \)

2. **\( P(E|H) \)** - The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in Computer Science:
   - Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills fit well, but his warm heart and empathy are not strong indicators for computer science compared to his other traits.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H)_{CS} = 0.4 \)

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)** - The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not enrolled in Computer Science:
   - Given the specificity of his traits to fields like Agricultural and Veterinary Science, this is somewhat lower.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H)_{CS} = 0.3 \)

### Computation

Now, we apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field. Let's compute \( P(E) \) first:

\[ P(E)_{AVS} = P(E|H)_{AVS} \cdot P(H)_{AVS} + P(E|\neg H)_{AVS} \cdot P(\neg H)_{AVS} \]
\[ P(E)_{AVS} = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 \]
\[ P(E)_{AVS} = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{AVS} \cdot P(H)_{AVS}}{P(E)_{AVS}} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} \approx 0.1739 \]

\[ P(E)_{CS} = P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS} + P(E|\neg H)_{CS} \cdot P(\neg H)_{CS} \]
\[ P(E)_{CS} = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E)_{CS} = 0.08 + 0.24 = 0.32 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H)_{CS} \cdot P(H)_{CS}}{P(E)_{CS}} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \approx 0.25 \]

Therefore:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.1739",
  "computer science": "0.25"
}
