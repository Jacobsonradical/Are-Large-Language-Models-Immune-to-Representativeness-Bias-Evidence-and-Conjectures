Let's break down the situation using Bayes' rule for both fields. 

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
   - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability that a computer science student has a personality sketch like Adam's.
   - **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability that a non-computer science student has a personality sketch like Adam's.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **P(E|H)**: This is the probability that an agricultural and veterinary science student has a personality sketch like Adam's.
   - **P(E|¬H)**: This is the probability that a non-agricultural and veterinary science student has a personality sketch like Adam's.

Without exact data, we will make reasonable estimates:

- For **computer science**:
  - **P(H)**: Moderate likelihood, say 0.20 (given the high popularity of the field).
  - **P(E|H)**: Low likelihood, as traits like empathy and love for animals are less stereotypically associated with computer science, say 0.10.
  - **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of the personality sketch in fields other than computer science, assume 0.30.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.20}{0.10 \times 0.20 + 0.30 \times 0.80} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.24} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077 \]

- For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
  - **P(H)**: Lower overall probability but not negligible, say 0.05 (specific yet relevant).
  - **P(E|H)**: High likelihood, as empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature are highly relevant, say 0.70.
  - **P(E|¬H)**: Probability of the personality sketch in fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, assume 0.25.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \times 0.05}{0.70 \times 0.05 + 0.25 \times 0.95} = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.2375} = \frac{0.035}{0.2725} \approx 0.128 \]

So, the computed probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.128
}
