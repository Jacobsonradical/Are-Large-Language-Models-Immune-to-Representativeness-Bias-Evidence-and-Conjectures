To compute \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we first need a heuristic estimation of \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\). Then, we'll use Bayes' Rule to derive \(P(H|E)\).

The formula for Bayes' Rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) can be expanded as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since we do not have exact probabilities, we will make educated estimations.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

Let's denote:
- \( H_{\text{agri}} \) to be the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( E \) is his personality sketch.

#### Estimations for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) \): The prior probability that any random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate it around \(0.1\). 

- \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \): The likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science is quite high since it fits well with his interests and empathy for animals. Let's estimate it around \(0.7\).

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \): The probability of Adam having this personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate it around \(0.2\) because these traits can fit other fields but are not as aligned as they are with agricultural and veterinary science.

#### Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{agri}})} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.18} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.25} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = 0.28 \]

### Computer Science

Let's denote:
- \( H_{\text{cs}} \) to be the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( E \) is his personality sketch.

#### Estimations for Computer Science:

- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): The prior probability that any random graduate student is in computer science. Let's estimate it around \(0.15\) because it's a broad and popular field.

- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): The likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch given he is in computer science is moderate since some traits such as high intelligence and solving puzzles fit well, but his strong empathy and love for nature might not be as perfectly aligned. Let's estimate it around \(0.4\).

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \): The probability of Adam having this personality sketch given that he is not in computer science. Let's estimate it around \(0.3\) because his traits could be spread across various fields.

#### Calculation for Computer Science:

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{cs}})} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.4 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.85} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.255} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.315} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = 0.19 \]

Therefore, the values are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "computer science": 0.19
}
