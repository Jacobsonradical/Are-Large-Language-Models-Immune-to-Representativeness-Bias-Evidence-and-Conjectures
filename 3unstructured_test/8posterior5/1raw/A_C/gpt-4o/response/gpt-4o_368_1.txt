To compute \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), where \(P(\neg H)\) is the probability that Adam is not enrolled in a specific field.

Let's assign prior probabilities \(P(H)\) based on the general likelihood of a graduate student being enrolled in each field:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science** 
2. **Computer science**

For simplicity, we assume the following:

\[ P(H) \]
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Let's estimate \(P(H)\) for agricultural and veterinary science as 0.1 (10%), considering it's not among the most common fields but not exceedingly rare either.
- **Computer science**: Let's estimate \(P(H)\) for computer science as 0.3 (30%), considering it is a very popular field of study among graduate students in the U.S.

Next, let's evaluate \(P(E|H)\):

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals), \(P(E|H)\) is high. Let's assign \(P(E|H) = 0.8\).
- **Computer science**: Given Adam's intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, but not necessarily having a strong nature orientation, \(P(E|H) \approx 0.4\).

For \(P(E|\neg H)\), we estimate the likelihood of Adam's characteristics given he is not in the specific field. Since \(\neg H\) represents the complement, encompassing all other fields, we will assign:

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.2\); being interested in nature and animals is less common.
- **Computer science**: \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.7\); intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are attributes also valued in many other fields.

Now, we calculate \(P(H|E)\):

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} = 0.3077 \]

- **Computer science**:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.4 \cdot 0.3 + 0.7 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.49} = \frac{0.12}{0.61} = 0.1967 \]
