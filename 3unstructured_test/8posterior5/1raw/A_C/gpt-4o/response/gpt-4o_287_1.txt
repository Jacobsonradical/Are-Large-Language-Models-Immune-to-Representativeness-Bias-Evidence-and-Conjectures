To apply Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \) for both agricultural and veterinary science, and computer science.

### Estimations:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: Let's estimate the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field may not be as common as some other fields. Let's assume a reasonable estimate: \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
  
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, he seems well-suited to the agricultural and veterinary sciences. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) should be high. Let's set it at \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
  
- **P(E|\neg H)**: For the general population of graduate students not in agricultural and veterinary sciences, the probability that someone has Adam's profile could be relatively lower. Letâ€™s estimate it at \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

### Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

Bayes' Theorem: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.05)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

#### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: Computer science is a very common field in graduate studies. Let's assume a higher prior: \( P(H) = 0.25 \).
  
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's affinity for solving puzzles and high intelligence for abstract concepts, but not necessarily empathy and nature, \( P(E|H) \) should still be reasonably high, but not as high as agricultural and veterinary science. We can estimate it at \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
  
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Same estimation as for agricultural and veterinary science, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

### Calculation for Computer Science:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.25)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.125 + 0.075 = 0.2 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.25}{0.2} = 0.625 \]

### Summary Answer:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.296",
  "computer science": "0.625"
}
