To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to assume or estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being in each field), \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is in the field), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is not in the field).

For simplicity, we'll assume \( P(E) \) is a constant for both fields since it doesn't affect the relative comparison between the two fields.

### Let's break down the estimates:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: Given that computer science is a common field, we'll estimate this to be higher but not excessively so. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
   - **P(E|H)**: The personality sketch describes someone empathic, fond of nature, and abstract concepts. While computer science students can have such traits, it's less characteristic. We'll estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not in computer science. Since other fields might better fit the description, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.2 \cdot 0.2 + (1 - 0.2) \cdot 0.3} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.24} = \frac{0.04}{0.28} \approx 0.143
   \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)**: This field is less common, but the personality sketch aligns closely with this field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
   - **P(E|H)**: The description fits perfectly with a student in agricultural and veterinary science. We'll estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.9 \).
   - **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Since other fields might be less fitting, we estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

   Using Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{AgVet} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.9}{0.1 \cdot 0.9 + (1 - 0.1) \cdot 0.2} = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.18} = \frac{0.09}{0.27} \approx 0.333
   \]

Summarizing the results:
