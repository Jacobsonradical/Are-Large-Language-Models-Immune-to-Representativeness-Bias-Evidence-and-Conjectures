To apply Bayes' Rule, we need the probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch (P(H|E)). Bayes' Rule is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's analyze each of the given fields step by step.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The probability that any randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's tentatively set this as a low prior based on the total number of such students compared to other fields. For simplicity, let's assume:
   \[ P(H) = 0.05 \] (5% of graduate students).

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam, given his personality sketch, would be in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his deep love for animals, strong empathy, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants, this probability is quite high:
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. While his traits could relate to many other fields, they are less likely compared to this specific match:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The probability that any randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Due to the high number of students in this field, let's assume:
   \[ P(H) = 0.2 \] (20% of graduate students).

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam, given his personality sketch, would be in computer science. Given his interest in puzzles and high intelligence, this is somewhat relevant but not as strong as the previous field:
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.4 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is not in computer science. His traits would similarly match many other fields, so this might also be:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

### Calculation

We are not given \(P(E)\), but we can simplify the Bayes' formula due to proportionality:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

### Normalization
To normalize these probabilities, we sum them and then divide each by this sum:
\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural \& veterinary} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.08} = \frac{0.04}{0.12} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{computer science} = \frac{0.08}{0.04 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.12} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]

So the probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.33",
  "computer science": "0.67"
}
