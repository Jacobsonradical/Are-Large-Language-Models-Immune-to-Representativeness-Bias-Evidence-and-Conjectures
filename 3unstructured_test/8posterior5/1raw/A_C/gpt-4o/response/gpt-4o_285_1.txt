To calculate \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, which can be derived from the total probability of all potential fields (although we won't necessarily need this to compare probabilities between fields).

Now, let's decide on our values for each variable.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Probability Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science. Since this field aligns quite well with Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, let's assume it's moderately probable.
  - \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam was in this field, the personality sketch seems highly likely.
  - \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Probability Adam was in computer science. This is also a possible field given Adam's high intelligence and ability to solve puzzles, though it seems less aligned with his love for nature and animals.
  - \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam was in this field, the personality sketch is somewhat likely due to his intelligence and abstract thinking but less so for nature and animals.
  - \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we can use proportional reasoning to compare \( P(H|E) \) values directly:

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

### Calculation:

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16
\]

For **Computer Science**:
\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03
\]

Normalizing these:

Total proportional factor:
\[
0.16 + 0.03 = 0.19
\]

Thus:
\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.19} \approx 0.842
\]
\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.19} \approx 0.158
\]

Let's round these values for simplicity:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.84,
  "computer science": 0.16
}
```

These results suggest that based on the personality sketch, it is much more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
