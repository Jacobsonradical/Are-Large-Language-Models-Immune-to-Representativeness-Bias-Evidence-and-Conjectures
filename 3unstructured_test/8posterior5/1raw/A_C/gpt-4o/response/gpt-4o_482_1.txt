Certainly! To determine \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we need to break it down into the relevant components:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' Rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to simplify comparisons without needing the actual value of \( P(E) \) (total probability of E), we can focus on the Bayesian numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \):

- \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \)

For "agricultural and veterinary science" (AGS) and "computer science" (CS):
### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H_AGS):** 
The overall probability of being enrolled in this field without any additional information. Let's assume a moderate value, acknowledging these are not the most or least common fields.

- \( P(H_{\text{AGS}}) = 0.1 \)

**P(E|H_AGS):** 
Given the personality description, Adam's involves a curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication, which aligns very well with agricultural and veterinary sciences.

- \( P(E|H_{\text{AGS}}) = 0.9 \)

**P(E|\neg H_AGS):** 
The probability of having such a personality sketch for someone in a different field. Without being too specific, people in many other fields may not have such a specific alignment with Adam's traits.

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AGS}}) = 0.3 \)

Using these, we calculate the numerator for Bayes' Rule:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AGS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AGS}}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \)

### 2. Computer Science

**P(H_CS):** 
The overall probability of being enrolled in this field, recognizing it's a very popular field among graduate students.

- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \)

**P(E|H_CS):** 
This is a bit lower since the personality sketch does not align as directly with typical CS interests, though his intelligence and puzzle-solving fit well.

- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \)

**P(E|\neg H_CS):** 
As before, diversity of fields but lower chance for exact personality match.

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \)

Using these, we calculate the numerator for Bayes' Rule:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12 \)

Now, we compare these numerators and normalize them to get probabilities for each hypothesis given E:

### Normalized Probabilities
To find \( P(H_{\text{AGS}}|E) \) and \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \), we normalize:

- Total = \( 0.09 + 0.12 = 0.21 \)

- \( P(H_{\text{AGS}}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.21} \approx 0.43 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.21} \approx 0.57 \)

So the answers would be:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.43,
  "computer science": 0.57
}
```
