To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the given personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the given personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.
4. Using these, we compute \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field given the personality sketch \( E \).

For simplicity, I'll assume some likely values based on common knowledge and the given information:

1. **P(H) for agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - It is relatively less common for graduate students to be in this field compared to more popular fields like computer science. For simplicity, let’s assume 0.05.

2. **P(E|H) for agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - Adam’s personality sketch strongly aligns with this field as it involves nature, plants, animals, and empathy. Let’s assume a high probability of 0.9.

3. **P(E|\neg H) for agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - The sketch is quite specialized, so the likelihood of this personality sketch appearing in fields outside agricultural and veterinary science would be lower. Let’s assume 0.2.

4. **P(H) for computer science**:
   - This is a highly popular field, so it is relatively more likely for a random graduate student to be enrolled in it. Let’s assume 0.3.

5. **P(E|H) for computer science**:
   - Adam’s personality sketch does not strongly align with computer science. Let’s assume a moderate probability of 0.3.

6. **P(E|\neg H) for computer science**:
   - Given the specificity of the personality sketch, this is low. Let’s assume 0.4.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's compute each step:

**For agricultural and veterinary science**:

\[ P(E)_{\text{agriculture}} = (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) \]
\[ P(E)_{\text{agriculture}} = 0.045 + 0.19 = 0.235 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agriculture}} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.235} = \frac{0.045}{0.235} \approx 0.191 \]

**For computer science**:

\[ P(E)_{\text{computer}} = (0.3 \cdot 0.3) + (0.4 \cdot 0.7) \]
\[ P(E)_{\text{computer}} = 0.09 + 0.28 = 0.37 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer}} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.37} = \frac{0.09}{0.37} \approx 0.243 \]

So the final answer is:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.191,
  "computer science": 0.243
}
```
