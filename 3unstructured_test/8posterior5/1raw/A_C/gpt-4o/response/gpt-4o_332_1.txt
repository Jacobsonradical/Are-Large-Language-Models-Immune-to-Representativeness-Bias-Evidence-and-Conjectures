To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Assign Initial Probabilities:**
   - \( P(H) \) is the initial (prior) probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
   - \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that the personality sketch \( E \) matches Adam if he is indeed enrolled in that field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability that the personality sketch \( E \) matches Adam if he is not enrolled in that specific field.

2. **Apply Bayes' Rule:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we are primarily interested in comparing the values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1-P(H)) \).

Let's start with some reasonable estimates:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**Hypotheses:**
- \( P(H) \): A rough guess of the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam fits the personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam fits the personality sketch given that he is not in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, and his empathy, he seems well-suited for agricultural and veterinary science.

**Estimates:**
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume this is about 0.05 (5%), as it's not a very common graduate field compared to others.
- \( P(E|H) \): High, given his traits. Let's say 0.8 (80%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Lower, considering his specific interests align more with this field. Let's estimate 0.2 (20%).

### Computer Science
**Hypotheses:**
- \( P(H) \): A rough guess of the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam fits the personality sketch given that he is in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam fits the personality sketch given that he is not in computer science.

Considering Adam's high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, computer science could also be a possibility, though his love for nature and animals might be less relevant.

**Estimates:**
- \( P(H) \): Higher, perhaps around 0.2 (20%), as computer science is a popular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Moderate since his traits somewhat align. Let's say 0.5 (50%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Slightly lower since his traits might not be as strongly aligned with non-computer science fields. Letâ€™s estimate 0.4 (40%).

Now we compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[
P(H|E)_{agricultural} = \frac{P(E|H)_{agricultural} \cdot P(H)_{agricultural}}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)}
\]
### Computer Science
\[
P(H|E)_{computer} = \frac{P(E|H)_{computer} \cdot P(H)_{computer}}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for both fields, we focus on the numerator comparisons.

### Agriculture and Veterinary Science: 
\[ 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1 \]

To convert these into reasonable probabilities (considering sums less than 1.0), we'll normalize them:

\[
P(H|E)_{agricultural} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.1} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.14} \approx 0.286
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{computer} = \frac{0.1}{0.04 + 0.1} \approx \frac{0.1}{0.14} \approx 0.714
\]

So, based on these estimates:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.286",
  "computer science": "0.714"
}
\]
