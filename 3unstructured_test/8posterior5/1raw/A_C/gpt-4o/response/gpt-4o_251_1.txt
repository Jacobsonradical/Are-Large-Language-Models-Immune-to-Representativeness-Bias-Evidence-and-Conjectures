To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Given the nature of the fields and Adam's personality sketch, we can make reasonable estimates for these probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science could be estimated, but generally, it might be a less common field compared to some others. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.10 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and dedication, he strongly aligns with the characteristics desirable in this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches any field other than agricultural and veterinary science would be lower since not all fields value these traits equally. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \).

Now for Bayes' rule, we first need the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). This can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.80 \times 0.10 + 0.20 \times 0.90 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.10}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.31 \]

### Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The probability that a random graduate student is in computer science is quite high given the popularity of the field. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.20 \).

2. **P(E|H)**: Adamâ€™s intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts are traits that fit well with computer science, but his strong focus on nature and empathy might be less aligned. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.50 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch matches any field other than computer science would be somewhat less focused on the traits specific to computer science. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.25 \).

Now for Bayes' rule:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.50 \times 0.20 + 0.25 \times 0.80 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.10 + 0.20 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.30 \]

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.50 \times 0.20}{0.30} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10}{0.30} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.33 \]

Finally, let's put it all together:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.31,
  "computer science": 0.33
}
