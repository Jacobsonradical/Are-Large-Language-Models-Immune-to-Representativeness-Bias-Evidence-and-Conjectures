First, let's break down the problem using Bayes' rule. To compute \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch), we need the following components:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field before knowing the personality sketch.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of obtaining the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the specific field.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of obtaining the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in the specific field.
4. **\( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of obtaining the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across both fields we are comparing, we can use a simplified form:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's assign values based on intuition and the given personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Moderately high, as there are numerous fields available in graduate programs, but not dominant ones. Let's assign 0.15.
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, given Adam's love for nature, plants, empathy, and love for animals. Let's assign 0.9.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Assuming most other fields don't align as well with the personality traits. Let's assign 0.2.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): This is a fairly common and popular field. Let's assign 0.2.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, given Adam's intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving skills. Let's assign 0.5.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Since the personality sketch fits moderately well with computer science. Let's assign 0.5.

Using the simplified form of Bayes' rule \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \):

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E)_\text{agricultural} \propto 0.9 \times 0.15 = 0.135 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_\text{computer} \propto 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]

Normalizing these, we get:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H|E)_\text{agricultural} &\approx \frac{0.135}{0.135 + 0.1} = \frac{0.135}{0.235} \approx 0.574 \\
P(H|E)_\text{computer} &\approx \frac{0.1}{0.135 + 0.1} = \frac{0.1}{0.235} \approx 0.426 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, the probabilities, not necessarily adding up to 1, are approximately:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.574",
  "computer science": "0.426"
}
