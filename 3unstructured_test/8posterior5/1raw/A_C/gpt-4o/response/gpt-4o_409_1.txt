To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Theorem, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \), the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not in that field.
4. \( P(E) \), the overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
Since \( P(E) \) involves the total probability including all other possible fields, it is generally easier to compare the relative \( P(H|E) \) values between fields directly.

Assuming the following:
- \( P(H) \) for both fields is equal initially, say 0.5 for simplicity.
- A strong fit of Adamâ€™s characteristics to the field increases \( P(E|H) \).
- The more general nature of the field would adjust \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### For Computer Science:
- **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a reasonable prior of 0.5.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's characteristics somewhat align with interests in puzzles and high intelligence, which may be more typical in computer science, yet not strongly aligned with love for nature and animals.
  Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Not necessarily significant characteristics outside computer science, let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **\( P(H) \)**: Prior might also start as 0.5.
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Strong alignment with love for nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work.
  Outcome might be \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: this becomes broader, thus \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

From this:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

So:
- **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15
  \]
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4
  \]

Finally, normalizing these values to compare:
\[
P(H|E)_\text{CS} = \frac{0.15}{0.15+0.4} = \frac{0.15}{0.55} \approx 0.27
\]
\[
P(H|E)_\text{AVS} = \frac{0.4}{0.55} \approx 0.73
\]

Thus, the probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.27,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.73
}
