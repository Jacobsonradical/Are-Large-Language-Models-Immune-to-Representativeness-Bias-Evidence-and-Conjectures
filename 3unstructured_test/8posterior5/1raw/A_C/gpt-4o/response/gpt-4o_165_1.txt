To solve this, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in the field.
4. \( P(E) \): Overall probability of the evidence (a weighted sum of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)).

Given that exact values are often not easily obtainable, I'll provide estimates based on the information provided.

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): We need to assume some prior probability. For simplicity, let's assume generally many students are in STEM fields, so we might estimate a prior of about 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): The evidence suggests Adam has traits that might not be directly aligned with typical computer science students but can appear among them (e.g., puzzles, intelligence). Let's set this as 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in computer science, it is still highly likely he could exhibit these traits because they are quite general. Let's estimate this at 0.5.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 = 0.03 + 0.45 = 0.48 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.48} \approx 0.0625 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): Considering Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, the prior probability might reasonably be higher. Let's estimate this at 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): Adamâ€™s traits strongly align with this field. We can estimate this at 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): If Adam is not in this field, the evidence (nature, plants, animals) is less likely but not impossible. Let's set this at 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8 = 0.16 + 0.16 = 0.32 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.32} = \frac{0.16}{0.32} = 0.5 \]

So, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.0625,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
```
