Let's denote the following:

- "agricultural and veterinary science" as \( H_1 \)
- "computer science" as \( H_2 \)

Now, let's outline our approach step-by-step for each field.

### Step 1: Estimate Initial Probabilities \( P(H) \)

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** \( P(H_1) \):
   - Graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science fields are relatively common but not the most numerous. Let's assume the probability is moderate.
   - \(P(H_1) = 0.1\)

2. **Computer Science** \( P(H_2) \):
   - Graduate students in computer science are quite numerous. It's a very popular field.
   - \(P(H_2) = 0.2\)

### Step 2: Estimate \( P(E|H) \)

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** \( P(E|H_1) \):
   - Adam's interests and personality traits strongly correlate with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, this probability is relatively high.
   - \(P(E|H_1) = 0.8\)

2. **Computer Science** \( P(E|H_2) \):
   - While Adam has intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles (relevant traits for computer science), his deep love for animals and nature suggests this field less strongly.
   - \(P(E|H_2) = 0.3\)

### Step 3: Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)

Here, \(\neg H\) represents all other fields of study. 

1. For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Other fields might only partially align with Adam's personality sketch.
   - \(P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.5\)

2. For **Computer Science**:
   - Similar reasoning as \(\neg H_1\).
   - \(P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.6\)

### Step 4: Calculate \( P(H|E) \) Using Bayesâ€™ Rule

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.1 + 0.5 \times (1-0.1)} 
   = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.45} 
   = \frac{0.08}{0.53} 
   \approx 0.151
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.6 \times (1-0.2)} 
   = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.48} 
   = \frac{0.06}{0.54} 
   \approx 0.111
   \]

### Final Result

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.151,
  "computer science": 0.111
}
```
