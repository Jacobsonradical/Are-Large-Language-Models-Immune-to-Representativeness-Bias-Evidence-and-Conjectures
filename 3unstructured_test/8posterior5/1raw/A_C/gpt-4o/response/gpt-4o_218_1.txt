Let's start by considering the fields of study, "computer science" and "agricultural and veterinary science," and use the given information to apply Bayes' Rule.

**1. Computer Science:**
- P(H_computer_science): The probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is studying computer science. Let's assume computer science is one of the more common fields, so P(H) might be higher.
- P(E|H_computer_science): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone studying computer science. Facts such as high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are positive indicators here.
- P(E|\neg H_computer_science): The probability of the personality sketch E given Adam is not in computer science. We would need this to figure out the complement scenario, but we may assume that it's more likely given fields like humanities or social sciences.

**2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- P(H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science): The probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This probability is likely lower compared to computer science due to field popularity.
- P(E|H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science): Adam's personality fits well with this field as he has a deep love for animals and a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- P(E|\neg H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science): Similar to computer science, but here, it may be that only specific fields like the physical sciences align closely with some components.

### Assumptions for Probabilities:
- P(H_computer_science) = 0.2
- P(E|H_computer_science) = 0.7
- P(E|\neg H_computer_science) = 0.3

- P(H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science) = 0.1
- P(E|H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science) = 0.9
- P(E|\neg H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science) = 0.4

### Bayesâ€™ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \)

#### Computer Science Calculation:
\[ P(E)_{cs} = (0.7 * 0.2) + (0.3 * 0.8) = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38 \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.7 * 0.2}{0.38} = \frac{0.14}{0.38} \approx 0.3684 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science Calculation:
\[ P(E)_{avs} = (0.9 * 0.1) + (0.4 * 0.9) = 0.09 + 0.36 = 0.45 \]
\[ P(H_{avs}|E) = \frac{0.9 * 0.1}{0.45} = \frac{0.09}{0.45} = 0.2 \]

### Answer:
