To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we'll need to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

**Bayes' Rule states:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where,
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of evidence given not the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

For simplicity, we'll focus directly on estimating the numerators involved in Bayes' Rule, avoiding exact computation of the denominator \( P(E) \) since we are comparing relative probabilities for different fields.

### 1. Computer Science

- **\( P(H) \) (Prior for Computer Science):**
  Assume computer science is a popular field. Let's say \( P(H) \) = 0.2 (20%).

- **\( P(E|H) \) (Probability of E given H, for Computer Science):**
  Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, puzzle solving) are not stereotypically associated with the typical computer science profile but are not entirely excluded either. 
  Assume \( P(E|H) \) = 0.1 (10%).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of E given not H, for Computer Science):**
  Other fields like humanities, biological sciences, and social sciences might align more closely with Adam's traits.
  Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.6 (60%).

Then, using estimates:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.48} = \frac{0.02}{0.5} \approx 0.04 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(H) \) (Prior for Agricultural and Veterinary Science):**
  Considered a less popular field compared to computer science.
  Assume \( P(H) \) = 0.05 (5%).

- **\( P(E|H) \) (Probability of E given H, for Agricultural and Veterinary Science):**
  Adam's personality traits fit very well with this field. He's curious about nature, loves animals, and understands hard work.
  Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) = 0.7 (70%).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of E given not H, for Agricultural and Veterinary Science):**
  Other fields might not match as closely. Given empirical data we considered priorly:
  Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.2 (20%).

Then, using estimates:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H))} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.7 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.19} = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \approx 0.156 \]
