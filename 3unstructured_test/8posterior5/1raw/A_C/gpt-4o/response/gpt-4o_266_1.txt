To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for both fields using Bayes' rule, we follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's denote:
- \( H_1 \) for "agricultural and veterinary science" 
- \( H_2 \) for "computer science"

Since we are only given limited contextual information, our estimates will be heuristic and not based on specific empirical data.

### Estimations

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(H_1):** This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his personality sketch aligns strongly with nature, plants, and animals, a heuristic estimate might be higher. Let's assume:
   \[ P(H_1) = 0.25 \]

2. **P(E|H_1):** The likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in agricultural science. Given Adam's characteristics, this seems somewhat plausible:
   \[ P(E|H_1) = 0.8 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H_1):** The likelihood of the personality sketch given he is not in agricultural science. Adam could still fit well in many other fields that have similar interests in nature and animals but perhaps with lower probability:
   \[ P(E|\neg H_1) = 0.3 \]

#### Computer Science:
1. **P(H_2):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Given his intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and abstract thinking, it's plausible but slightly less likely considering his strong outdoor orientation:
   \[ P(H_2) = 0.15 \]

2. **P(E|H_2):** The likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in computer science. His empathy and nature interests may be less aligned, so this value might be lower:
   \[ P(E|H_2) = 0.4 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H_2):** The likelihood of the personality sketch given he is not in computer science. Since his characteristics fit more naturally with disciplines involving living beings and nature, this would be a bit higher:
   \[ P(E|\neg H_2) = 0.7 \]

### Calculation
Since \( P(E) \) can be simplified as a normalization factor across all hypotheses, we can ignore that in a relative comparison. Here is how \( P(H|E) \) for both fields would be calculated relatively:

\[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) \]
\[ P(H_1|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.25 = 0.2 \]

\[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.15 = 0.06 \]

We can then normalize these values such that the total probabilities sum to 1 if needed. However, strictly following the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.06
