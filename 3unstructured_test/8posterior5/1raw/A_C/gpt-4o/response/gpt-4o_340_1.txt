To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \)
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \)
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence \( E \)

Since \( P(E) \) will cancel out when comparing relative probabilities among different hypotheses, we'll focus on the numerator:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Now let's judge the values for each field and apply Bayes' Rule:

### For Computer Science:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H_{CS}) \)**: 
   Graduate students in computer science are fairly common, so let's assume \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**:
   Given Adam’s traits:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Not highly relevant
   - Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles: Relevant
   - Warm heart, empathy, animals: Not highly relevant
   - High intelligence, appreciates hard work: Relevant
   We can assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H_{AgVet}) \)**: 
   Fewer students might be in this field compared to computer science, so let's assume \( P(H_{AgVet}) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{AgVet}) \)**:
   Given Adam’s traits:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Highly relevant
   - Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles: Neutral
   - Warm heart, empathy, animals: Highly relevant
   - High intelligence, appreciates hard work: Highly relevant
   We can assume \( P(E|H_{AgVet}) = 0.8 \).

### Normalize the Posterior Probabilities:
Now, let's compute the unnormalized posterior probabilities and then normalize them:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{AgVet}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AgVet}) \cdot P(H_{AgVet}) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Normalize to give relative probabilities:
Total = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.429 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{AgVet}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.14} \approx 0.571 \]

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.429,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.571
}
```

These probabilities indicate that based on Adam’s personality traits, it is more likely that he was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science rather than Computer Science.
