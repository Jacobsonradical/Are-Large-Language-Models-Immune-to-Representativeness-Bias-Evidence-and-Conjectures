In order to compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following probabilities for each field:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

Let's start by estimating these for each field:

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science. Assuming the distribution of graduate students across different fields is more or less even, let’s assume this to be around 0.1 (10%).

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. Given that Computer Scientists might also enjoy solving puzzles and have high intelligence but might be less involved with nature and animals, let's assign this a lower value, say 0.05 (5%).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in Computer Science. This could be more common in other fields like Agricultural and Veterinary Science, as the sketch aligns more with those areas. Let’s assume this to be 0.95 (95%).

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be approximated as \( P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \).

Using the values:
\[ P(E) \approx 0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.95 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.005 + 0.855 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.86 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.86} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.005}{0.86} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0058 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Again, assuming an even distribution, let’s keep this around 0.1 (10%).

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is likely high because it aligns well with the profile sketch (interest in nature, animals, etc.). Let’s assume this to be 0.8 (80%).

- **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. This would be lower because other fields are less aligned with the sketch. Let’s assume this to be 0.2 (20%).

Now, applying Bayes' theorem with these values:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]

Using the values:
\[ P(E) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.08 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.26 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3077 \]

Therefore, the final probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.0058,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3077
}
