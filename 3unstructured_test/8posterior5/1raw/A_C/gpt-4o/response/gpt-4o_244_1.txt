To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the relevant probabilities. Let's denote:

- \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) \) and \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \) as the prior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science and computer science, respectively.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \) and \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \) as the likelihoods, which are the probabilities of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science and computer science, respectively.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) \) and \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \) as the probabilities of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science and computer science, respectively.
- \( P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) \) and \( P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \) as the posterior probabilities that we want to compute.

### Prior Probabilities
Given that there are many graduate fields, let's assume:
- \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) \approx 0.05 \): Since agricultural and veterinary science is a relatively specialized field.
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.10 \): Since computer science is a more common graduate field.

### Likelihoods
- \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \): Adam's interests and empathy are strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this at around 0.8.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): Adam's puzzle-solving abilities and high intelligence align with computer science, but his love for nature and animals makes this less likely. Let's estimate this at around 0.3.

### Complementary Likelihoods
We need to judge how likely Adam's personality sketch is if he is not enrolled in these fields. Given the number of graduate fields, this is quite speculative:
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{ag}}) \approx 0.2 \): It is less common for someone in other fields to have such a strong alignment with the personality described.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.7 \): Adam's personality can still apply to other scientific and technical fields.

### Bayes' Rule
Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Calculations
#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E)_{\text{ag}} = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95 \approx 0.24 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.24} \approx 0.167 \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(E)_{\text{cs}} = 0.3 \cdot 0.10 + 0.7 \cdot 0.90 \approx 0.66 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.10}{0.66} \approx 0.045 \]
