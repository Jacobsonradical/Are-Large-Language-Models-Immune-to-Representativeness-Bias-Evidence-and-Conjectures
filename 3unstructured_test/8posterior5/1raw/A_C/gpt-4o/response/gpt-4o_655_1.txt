Sure, let's start by applying Bayes' rule, which is given as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to compute the probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field of study and then calculate \( P(H|E) \).

### Computer Science

#### Step 1: Estimating \( P(H) \)
- \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science. Let's assume approximately 10% (0.1) of graduate students are in this field.

#### Step 2: Estimating \( P(E|H) \)
- \( P(E|H) \): This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science. Adam's interests and qualities (love for animals, appreciation for nature) don't strongly align with computer science but his intelligence and puzzle-solving do. Let's estimate this as a moderate probability, say 0.2.

#### Step 3: Estimating \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in computer science. Since fields like agricultural and veterinary science align better with his traits, this probability might be higher, say 0.5.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Step 1: Estimating \( P(H) \)
- \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s assume approximately 5% (0.05) of graduate students are in this field.

#### Step 2: Estimating \( P(E|H) \)
- \( P(E|H) \): This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. His interests and qualities perfectly align with this field. Let’s estimate this as high, say 0.9.

#### Step 3: Estimating \( P(E|\neg H) \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that many other fields don’t align well with his personality, this might be lower, say 0.4.

### Calculation Using Bayes' Rule
Let's assume \( P(E) \) is the same for each field as it represents the overall likelihood of the personality sketch (a simplifying step since exact value is unknown and will cancel out):

#### Computer Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \]

Now comparing these fractions:

- For computer science: \(\frac{0.02}{P(E)}\)
- For agricultural and veterinary science: \(\frac{0.045}{P(E)}\)

Given the denominators are the same, we can compare the numerators directly:

- \( P(H|E) \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science} \) is larger than \( P(H|E) \text{ for computer science} \).

### Final Probabilities

Since we are comparing relative probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045
}
```
These are indicative values and reflect that Adam is more likely enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch.
