To solve for the probabilities, we need to estimate the following:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is in the specified field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is not in the specified field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specific field given the personality sketch.

Let's denote:
- H1 as the hypothesis that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science.
- H2 as the hypothesis that Adam was in computer science.

Based on the information given, we can make some reasonable estimates for these probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H1)**: Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This is a relatively niche field, so we can estimate it to be low, say around 0.05.
2. **P(E|H1)**: Given that Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, which aligns perfectly with agricultural and veterinary science, this is very high. Let's estimate it around 0.90.
3. **P(E|\neg H1)**: Given that Adam's interests are very specific and a bit niche, it's relatively unlikely that he would have these characteristics if he were in another field. Let's estimate it around 0.20.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \times P(H1)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H1) \times P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \times P(\neg H1) \).

### Computer Science
1. **P(H2)**: Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science, which is quite popular. We can estimate this higher, say around 0.20.
2. **P(E|H2)**: Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, this aligns with computer science, but not perfectly. Let's estimate it around 0.50.
3. **P(E|\neg H2)**: If Adam is not in computer science, given his characteristics, it is less likely that he would have these attributes. Let's estimate it around 0.30.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \times P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

Now, let's compute the probabilities:

### Computation
#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \times P(H1) + P(E|\neg H1) \times P(\neg H1) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.90 \times 0.05 + 0.20 \times (1 - 0.05) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.190 = 0.235 \]

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.90 \times 0.05}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H1|E) \approx \frac{0.045}{0.235} \]
\[ P(H1|E) \approx 0.191 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(E) = P(E|H2) \times P(H2) + P(E|\neg H2) \times P(\neg H2) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.50 \times 0.20 + 0.30 \times (1 - 0.20) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.10 + 0.24 = 0.34 \]

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.50 \times 0.20}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H2|E) \approx \frac{0.10}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H2|E) \approx 0.294 \]
