To calculate \(P(H|E)\) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\).

Let's approach it step by step.

### For Computer Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in computer science.
   - Computer science is a common field for graduate students in the U.S. Let's estimate \(P(H)\) at around 15%.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam given he is in computer science.
   - Computer science students can have strong intelligence and problem-solving skills, but Adam's deep love for animals and nature might be less common. Let's estimate \(P(E|H)\) at around 10%.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not in computer science.
   - Given the strong correlation of Adam's personality with fields related to nature and animals, \(P(E|\neg H)\) might be higher. Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H)\) at around 20%.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.10 \times 0.15}{(0.10 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.015}{0.185} \approx 0.081 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - This field is less common than computer science, but Adam's personality aligns well. Let's estimate \(P(H)\) at around 5%.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work align very well. Let’s estimate \(P(E|H)\) at around 60%.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - For non-agricultural and veterinary fields, the personality traits would be less correlated. Let’s estimate \(P(E|\neg H)\) at around 15%.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.60 \times 0.05}{(0.60 \times 0.05) + (0.15 \times 0.95)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.1425} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{AVS} = \frac{0.03}{0.1725} \approx 0.174 \]

So, the probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.081,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174
}
