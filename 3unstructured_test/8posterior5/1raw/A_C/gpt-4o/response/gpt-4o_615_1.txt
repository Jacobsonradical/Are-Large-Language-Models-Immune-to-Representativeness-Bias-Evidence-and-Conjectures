To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the relevant probabilities. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.

Given that:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam.

Let's go through each hypothesis for the specified fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \): This is the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in this field. Let's assume this is relatively low because it is a more specialized field.
  - Estimated as: 0.05 (5%)

- \( P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \): This is the probability of Adam having his described personality if he is in this field. Given his love for nature, animals, and strong empathy, this is quite high.
  - Estimated as: 0.8 (80%)

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \): This is the probability of Adam having his described personality if he is NOT in this field. This may be moderate because there could be other fields with similar personality traits.
  - Estimated as: 0.3 (30%)

### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{\text{Computer Science}}) \): This is the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in this field. Considering the popularity of computer science, this is relatively high compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Estimated as: 0.2 (20%)

- \( P(E|H_{\text{Computer Science}}) \): This is the probability of Adam having his described personality if he is in this field. Since the personality traits do not strongly align with the typical traits associated with computer science (though possible), this is lower.
  - Estimated as: 0.2 (20%)

- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{Computer Science}}) \): This is the probability of Adam having his described personality if he is NOT in this field. This is similar to the above scenario.
  - Estimated as: 0.4 (40%)

### Calculation of Posterior Probabilities

We use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{Computer Science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{Computer Science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Computer Science}})}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, the calculations are:

\[ P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{Computer Science}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Now, normalizing these probabilities:

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.2 + \cdots \text{(contributions from other fields)} \]

Since we're only interested in the relative probabilities, we can simplify:

\[ P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.04} = 0.5 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{Computer Science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.04} = 0.5 \]

Thus, although these probabilities need to add up to the total considering other fields, without their contributions, the relative comparison tells us:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67,
  "computer science": 0.33
}
```
(Note: Actual probabilities would be scaled to sum to 1 when considering all possible fields. Here, the ratios imply a higher likelihood of agricultural and veterinary science vs. computer science for Adam.)
