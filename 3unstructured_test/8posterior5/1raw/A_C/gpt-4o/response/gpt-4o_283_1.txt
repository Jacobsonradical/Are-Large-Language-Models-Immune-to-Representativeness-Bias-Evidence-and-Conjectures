To apply Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following probabilities for each field (agricultural and veterinary science, and computer science):

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in the given field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in the given field.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given his personality sketch \( E \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all hypotheses, it can be omitted for the comparative purpose. We'll focus on computing the relative probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Adam was enrolled in agriculture and veterinary science. Let’s assume this is moderately likely given the number of students in this field.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.2 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was in agriculture and veterinary science. This field aligns well with his love for nature, plants, and animals.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was not in agriculture and veterinary science. Let’s assume students not in this field may have similar traits but to a lesser extent.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science. This is a popular field, so let’s assume it has a higher prior probability.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.3 \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was in computer science. Empathy, love for nature, and abstract thinking fit but may not align perfectly with the usual traits expected in this field.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was not in computer science. Students not in this field might have these traits but not as commonly.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.15 \]

Finally, we normalize these to get relative probabilities, keeping in mind that the total does not need to add up to 1.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```

This suggests that given Adam's personality sketch, it is slightly more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science.
