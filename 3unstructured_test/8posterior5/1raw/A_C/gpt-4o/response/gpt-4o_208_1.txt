To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break it down step-by-step for each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H\_CS)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. This could vary, but we may assume a relatively moderate value for graduate students.
   - **P(E|H\_CS)**: The probability that if Adam is in computer science, he has the characteristics described in E.
   - **P(E|\neg H\_CS)**: The probability that if Adam is not in computer science, he has the characteristics described in E.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H\_AVS)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **P(E|H\_AVS)**: The probability that if Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science, he has the characteristics described in E.
   - **P(E|\neg H\_AVS)**: The probability that if Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science, he has the characteristics described in E.

Let's assign reasonable values based on the personality sketch:

### Computer Science
- **P(H\_CS)**: Computer science is a common graduate field, so we might assume P(H\_CS) is moderately high, let's say 0.3.
- **P(E|H\_CS)**: Adam's love for animals and nature does not strongly align with the typical characteristics of computer science students. But his intelligence, problem-solving skills, and appreciation for hard work could fit. Let's estimate 0.2.
- **P(E|\neg H\_CS)**: Given the many fields that could handle Adam's characteristics better, let's estimate this as a bit higher, say 0.6.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H\_AVS)**: This field aligns well with Adam's love for nature and animals, but it’s generally less common than computer science. Let's assume 0.1.
- **P(E|H\_AVS)**: Adam’s characteristics strongly align with this field. Let's estimate 0.9.
- **P(E|\neg H\_AVS)**: Many fields don’t align with Adam's appreciation for nature and animals. Let’s estimate this as 0.3.

With these values, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \) for both fields:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

For **Computer Science**:

\[ P(H\_CS|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{(0.2 \times 0.3) + (0.6 \times (1-0.3))} \]

\[ P(H\_CS|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.42} = \frac{0.06}{0.48} \approx 0.125 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[ P(H\_AVS|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{(0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times (1-0.1))} \]

\[ P(H\_AVS|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.27} = \frac{0.09}{0.36} = 0.25 \]

So our answers are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.125,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25
}
