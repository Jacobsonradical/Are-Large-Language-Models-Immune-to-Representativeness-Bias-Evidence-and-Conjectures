Let's break down the information given and apply Bayes' Theorem to calculate \( P(H|E) \).

Given:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is *not* enrolled in a particular field.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- \( P(H) \): Let’s assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is moderate. Assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given his curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy, it is highly consistent with this field. Therefore, \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that there are many fields where curiosity, intelligence, and empathy are valuable, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Thus,
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Agri & Vet}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

### Computer Science

- \( P(H) \): Let’s assume the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science is moderately available in many schools. Assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given his intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, it is also somewhat consistent with this field. Therefore, \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given his other traits, we can keep this consistent with the previous approach, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Thus,
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Normalizing Constant \( P(E) \)

Since we do not have a full list of all possible fields and their probabilities, we approximate \( P(E) \) using the information available:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H)(1 - P(H)) = \left( \frac{\sum P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i)}{\sum P(H_i)} \right) \]

Given just these two fields, let's approximate:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{Agri & Vet}}) P(H_{\text{Agri & Vet}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) * P(H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.5 \cdot 0.1) = 0.04  + 0.05 = 0.09 \]
    
Now we calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Agri & Vet}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.09} ≈ 0.444 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.09} ≈ 0.556 \]

Hence, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.44,
  "computer science": 0.56
}
```

Remember, these values are approximations and can vary with more precise priors and component probabilities.
