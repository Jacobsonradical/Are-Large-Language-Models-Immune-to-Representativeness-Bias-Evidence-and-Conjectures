To calculate the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of the hypothesis), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of observing the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis).

We can then compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) can be expanded as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

For simplicity, we'll assume an equal prior probability for each field of study, say both \( P(H) \) values are initially 0.1. Note that the probabilities \( P(H) \) for different fields are relative.

**Let's assign qualitative estimates for the given fields based on the personality sketch:**

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): This field seems quite fitting given Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals. Let's assume a moderate prior probability.
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, as his traits align well with interests and requirements of this field.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate, assuming there are other fields that might also result in similar personality traits.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate, given his high intelligence and abstract-thinking capabilities.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate to low, as not all aspects of his personality perfectly align with computer science (not every computer science student would necessarily have a strong love for nature or animals).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Moderate to high, as computer science is a common field and he might fit partially.

Now, let's make rough numerical estimates:

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2 \)

For **Computer Science**:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

Let's compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{agriculture}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{agriculture}}) \]
\[ \approx 0.9 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ \approx 0.09 + 0.18 \]
\[ \approx 0.27 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}} | E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agriculture}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.27} \]
\[ \approx 0.333 \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ \approx 0.5 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ \approx 0.05 + 0.27 \]
\[ \approx 0.32 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.32} \]
\[ \approx 0.156 \]

Finally, the output for the specified fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.333,
  "computer science": 0.156
}
