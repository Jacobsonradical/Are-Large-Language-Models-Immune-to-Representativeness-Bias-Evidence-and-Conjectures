To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields (computer science and agricultural and veterinary science) given the personality sketch of Adam (E), we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality traits given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality traits \( E \).

Let's define and justify each component for the fields "computer science" and "agricultural and veterinary science".

### 1. Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior might be the general probability of any graduate student in the U.S. being enrolled in computer science. Let's assume this probability is relatively high, given the popularity of the field.
  \[ P(H)_{\text{cs}} = 0.20 \]

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam has the given traits if he is studying computer science. Traits like high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts fit well, but strong empathy and love for animals might not be closely related.
  \[ P(E|H)_{\text{cs}} = 0.30 \]

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam has these traits if he is not studying computer science. This is harder to estimate but should be lower since computer science attracts people with certain analytical traits.
  \[ P(E|\neg H)_{\text{cs}} = 0.10 \]

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower than computer science due to fewer students in this field.
  \[ P(H)_{\text{agri}} = 0.05 \]

- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of traits like empathy, love for animals, appreciation of hard work, and curiosity about nature is very high in this field.
  \[ P(E|H)_{\text{agri}} = 0.80 \]

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam has these traits if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Traits like these are much rarer outside this field given Adam's specific profile.
  \[ P(E|\neg H)_{\text{agri}} = 0.10 \]

Now, computing \( P(H|E) \):

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{cs}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{cs}}}{P(E)_{\text{cs}}} \]
\[ P(E)_{\text{cs}} = P(E|H)_{\text{cs}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{cs}} + P(E|\neg H)_{\text{cs}} \cdot P(\neg H)_{\text{cs}} \]
\[ P(E)_{\text{cs}} = 0.30 \cdot 0.20 + 0.10 \cdot (1 - 0.20) \]
\[ P(E)_{\text{cs}} = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.43 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{agri}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{agri}}}{P(E)_{\text{agri}}} \]
\[ P(E)_{\text{agri}} = P(E|H)_{\text{agri}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{agri}} + P(E|\neg H)_{\text{agri}} \cdot P(\neg H)_{\text{agri}} \]
\[ P(E)_{\text{agri}} = 0.80 \cdot 0.05 + 0.10 \cdot (1 - 0.05) \]
\[ P(E)_{\text{agri}} = 0.04 + 0.095 = 0.135 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri}} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.05}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agri}} = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.30 \]

So the final probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.43,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.30
}
