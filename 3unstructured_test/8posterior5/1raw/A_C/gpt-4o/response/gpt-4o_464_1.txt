Sure, let's first outline the probabilities we need to assign.

1. **Prior Probability** P(H): This is our initial belief about Adam being in a certain field before considering his personality sketch.
  
2. **Likelihood** P(E|H): This is the probability that the personality sketch E matches Adam if he is in a certain field H.

3. **Complement Likelihood** P(E|¬H): This is the probability that the personality sketch E matches Adam if he is not in a certain field H.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only interested in comparing the relative posterior probabilities and not the exact value, we can ignore the exact value of P(E), and we will only compare the numerators. Essentially:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

#### Likelihoods based on personality description:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals, it's very likely he could be in this field.
- **Computer Science**: Given Adam's intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, this field also seems quite probable.

#### Initial Prior Probabilities P(H):
Given there is no additional information, we'll assign equal initial priors to each field.

#### Likelihoods P(E|H):
- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**, Adam's characteristics align well with this field: high.
- For **Computer Science**, some of Adam's characteristics align well (like solving puzzles and intelligence) but not as strongly as the connection to nature and animals: medium-high.

#### Complement Likelihoods P(E|¬H):
- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**, if Adam were not in this field, it's still possible his characteristics could fit many fields: medium.
- For **Computer Science**, if Adam were not in this field, his characteristics could also fit various other fields: medium-high.

Given these considerations, I will assign sample values for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H):

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - P(H): 0.5 (prior belief)
  - P(E|H): 0.8
  - P(E|¬H): 0.4

- **Computer Science**:
  - P(H): 0.5 (prior belief)
  - P(E|H): 0.6
  - P(E|¬H): 0.7

Now, calculating the posteriors (excluding P(E) for relative comparison):

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4 \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.6 \cdot 0.5 = 0.3 \]

Therefore, in relative terms, here are the probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
