To apply Bayes' Theorem for determining \( P(H|E) \), we need to assess and compute the probabilities as follows:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in the specific field \(H\).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in the specific field \(H\).
4. \( P(E) \): Total probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\).

Bayes' Theorem formula is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we assume that \( P(E) \) is a constant when comparing the fields, so it can be factored out. Here's the assessment for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \): There's a low to moderate prior probability that a graduate student might be in this field. Assume this field is less common, but Adam's interest suggests some relevance.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)

- \( P(E|H) \): Adamâ€™s traits (love for nature, plants, and animals) strongly match the characteristics of someone enrolled in this field.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch appearing if Adam was not in this field. Given there are many other fields where empathy, intelligence, and curiosity could fit, but less so with such a specific match to nature and animals.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \): There's a high prior probability that a graduate student might be enrolled in computer science, as it is a common field.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) 

- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits (high intelligence, good at solving puzzles) might fit someone in computer science, but his love for nature and animals is less relevant here.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch if Adam was not in this field has to cover other possible fields, many of which could fit the general intelligence and curiosity aspects.
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \)

Now, we plug these values into Bayes' Theorem to obtain \( P(H|E) \) for each field, under the assumption that \( P(E) \) is constant:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \approx 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]

Therefore, the results (scaled proportionally) are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "computer science": 0.12
}
