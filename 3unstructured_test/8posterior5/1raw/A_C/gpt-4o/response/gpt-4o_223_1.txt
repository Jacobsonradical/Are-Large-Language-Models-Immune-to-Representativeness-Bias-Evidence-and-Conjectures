To determine the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields given Adam's personality sketch, we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam.

To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \) (which can be difficult to estimate directly, but can often be derived from the other values).

Given that we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can provide estimates based on the qualitative information:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This is moderately high given that Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals.
- **P(E|H)**: High, because Adam's characteristics align well with the kind of student who would enroll in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Moderate, because empathy and a love for animals can also be present in other fields, but the specific interest in nature and plants makes it slightly less likely if not in this field.

Given this qualitative assessment:
- Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) (since it is a plausible field but not overwhelmingly common).
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) (as the personality traits align well).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) (since these traits can occur in other fields too).

Applying Bayes' rule:

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Relatively lower compared to agricultural science because Adam's curiosity about nature and plants seems less aligned with this field.
- **P(E|H)**: Moderate, because his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills do fit well with computer science traits.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: Higher, because his other traits (empathy, love for nature and animals) might be less relevant or prevalent in computer science.

Given this qualitative assessment:
- Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (since it's less likely but not implausible).
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \) (as some traits fit well but others don't).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \) (because his traits are more typical of fields other than computer science).

Applying Bayes' rule:

Using these probability estimates, we can now apply Bayes' theorem for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.24}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1}{P(E)} \]

To maintain values between 0 and 1 without computing the exact \( P(E) \):

\[ \frac{P(H|E, \text{Agri Sci})}{P(H|E, \text{CS})} = \frac{0.24}{0.1} = 2.4 \]

This suggests that it's 2.4 times more likely for Adam to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Computer Science, given his personality sketch. Normalizing probabilities based on this ratio, and noting that other fields exist, we can present:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values indicate higher confidence in Adam's enrollment in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Computer Science, given his personality sketch.
