Let's begin by defining the terms and making reasonable assumptions based on the given information.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch, given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch, given that he is not enrolled in a specific field.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability of Adam being in a specific field, given his personality sketch, which is computed using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} {P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: Assume that the prior probability of any graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low, given the diversity of graduate fields. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).

- **P(E|H)**: His genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work is highly correlated with this field. Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

- **P(E|¬H)**: Since many fields do not closely match Adam's personality sketch, we can assume this to be relatively low. Let’s assume \( P(E|¬H) = 0.2 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05} {0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.2 \cdot 0.95} \approx 0.1739 \]

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Assume that computer science is a relatively common field for graduate students. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

- **P(E|H)**: His interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence aligns somewhat but not as strongly as the previous field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

- **P(E|¬H)**: This would be higher than for agriculture but still not too high. Let’s assume \( P(E|¬H) = 0.3 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2} {0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \approx 0.25 \]

### Summary of Posterior Probabilities

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1739,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

These values reflect the likelihood of Adam's field of enrollment based on his personality sketch. The posterior probabilities indicate that given Adam's characteristics, he has a higher likelihood of being in computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary science, although both probabilities are notable.
