To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to first estimate the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in the given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
**P(H)**: This should be relatively low, considering the broad range of graduate fields available. Let’s estimate \( P(H) \) = 0.05.
 
**P(E|H)**: Adam’s love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science. Let’s estimate \( P(E|H) \) = 0.7.

**P(E|\neg H)**: The probability that someone with Adam's personality sketch is not in agricultural and veterinary science might be a bit lower since his traits are very fitting for this field. Let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where 
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.19 = 0.225 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.225} = \frac{0.035}{0.225} \approx 0.156 \]

### For Computer Science:
**P(H)**: Let’s assume computer science has a higher prior probability given its popularity. Estimate \( P(H) \) = 0.1.

**P(E|H)**: While Adam’s intelligence and aptitude for puzzles fit computer science, his love for nature, plants, and animals doesn’t directly align. So, \( P(E|H) \) = 0.3.

**P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of someone with Adam’s profile not being in computer science might be reflective of a better suitability for fields like biology or environmental sciences. Let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.27 = 0.3 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.03}{0.3} = 0.1 \]

Based on these estimates, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:
