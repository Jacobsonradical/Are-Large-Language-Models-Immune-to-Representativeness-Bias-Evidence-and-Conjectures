To calculate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across both fields, we can simplify our comparison to:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### For Computer Science:
1. **\( P(H) \) - Prior Probability**: Computer Science is a popular field for graduate students. Let's assume \( P(H) \) to be moderate, say 0.3 (30%).
  
2. **\( P(E|H) \) - Likelihood of the Personality Given the Hypothesis**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which align well with Computer Science. However, his love for nature and animals is less relevant. So, let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) - Likelihood of the Personality Given other Fields**: This is more difficult to estimate. Since there are many fields other than Computer Science, let's roughly estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be 0.1 (10%).

Now, using these heuristics, we get:

\[ P(H|E \text{ for CS}) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **\( P(H) \) - Prior Probability**: Agricultural and Veterinary Science is less common compared to fields like Computer Science, but given Adam's interest in nature and animals, let's assume it to be a reasonable choice. Let's assign \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

2. **\( P(E|H) \) - Likelihood of the Personality Given the Hypothesis**: Adam's personality aligns closely with this field, especially his love for animals and nature. Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \) (70%).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) - Likelihood of the Personality Given other Fields**: Again, this is difficult to estimate exactly, but let's use the same rough estimate as for Computer Science, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

Now, using these heuristics, we get:

\[ P(H|E \text{ for AVS}) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

### Result:

{
  "computer science": "0.06",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.14"
}

Note that these values are not absolute probabilities but proportional to the likelihoods based on the given information.
