Let's proceed with assessing the probabilities and then applying Bayes' rule.

Given:
- E: Personality sketch of Adam.
- H: Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
  - H1: Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  - H2: Computer Science.
- NegH: Negation of the specific field hypothesis.

For Bayes' rule, we need:

- P(H): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- P(E|H): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that specific field.
- P(E|¬H): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in that field.

Overall, we are calculating P(H|E), the posterior probability:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \).

### Assessing Probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - P(H1): Prior probability of Adam being in the field of Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Since only a fraction of all graduate students are in this field, let's assume P(H1) is moderate, around 0.1.
   - P(E|H1): Given Adam's traits such as a curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work, it's highly likely he is in this field. Therefore, we set P(E|H1) high, around 0.8.
   - P(E|¬H1): This is the probability of having Adam's persona given he is not in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Nature-related traits may be less prevalent in non-agricultural fields but are generally positive traits, so we can set P(E|¬H1) moderately low, around 0.3.

   Calculate P(H1|E):
   
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|¬H1) \cdot (1 - P(H1)) = (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

   \[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   - P(H2): Prior probability of Adam being in the field of Computer Science. This field has a higher enrollment rate, so let's set P(H2) to 0.3.
   - P(E|H2): Given Adam's traits like high intelligence and problem-solving skills, he could be a fit for this field, but the nature and animal-loving traits are less directly relevant. Therefore, we can set this to around 0.5.
   - P(E|¬H2): For others not in Computer Science, their personality could follow similar distributions of curiosity and intelligence so we can set this around 0.3.

   Calculate P(H2|E):

   \[ P(E) = P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + P(E|¬H2) \cdot (1 - P(H2)) = (0.5 \cdot 0.3) + (0.3 \cdot 0.7) = 0.15 + 0.21 = 0.36 \]

   \[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.36} \approx 0.417 \]

Thus, our final results are as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.229,
  "computer science": 0.417
}
