To begin, we need to estimate the probabilities for Adam being enrolled in each field, given his personality sketch \(E\). We’ll use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we assume \(P(E)\) is the same across comparisons and hence it can be considered as a proportionality constant.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: 
   Computer Science is a popular field for graduate studies. We can tentatively assign a moderate prior probability.
   
   \[P(H_{CS}) = 0.3\]

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\) Construction**:
   Given the personality sketch \(E\), Adam seems to have a combination of traits that are not typical for a stereotypical computer science student.
   
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Not particularly frequent.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Common.
   - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Not necessarily typical.
   - High intelligence, abstract concepts: Relevant.

   \[P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4\]

3. **Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   Given the sketch, we can estimate traits distributed across different disciplines.
  
   \[P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.8\]
  
Computing \( P(H_{CS}|E) \):
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   Agricultural and veterinary science is less common than computer science but fits better with Adam's description.
   
   \[P(H_{AV}) = 0.05\]

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\) Construction**:
   Adam’s traits fit better into this field.
   
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Directly relevant.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Relevant for scientific research.
   - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Very fitting.
   - High intelligence, abstract concepts: Relevant.

   \[P(E|H_{AV}) = 0.9\]

3. **Complement Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
   Given the sketch, for fields other than agricultural and veterinary science, the traits somewhat reduce relevance.
   
   \[P(E|\neg H_{AV}) = 0.6\]

Computing \( P(H_{AV}|E) \):
\[
P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} \propto P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045
\]

Given the proportional comparisons, we can refine the conditional probabilities:

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.12 \quad \text{and} \quad P(H_{AV}|E) \propto 0.045
\]

Finally, normalizing the proportions to fit within 0 to 1 scale if needed.

To encapsulate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045
}
```
Keep in mind these are illustrative proportions, not normalized absolute probabilities.
