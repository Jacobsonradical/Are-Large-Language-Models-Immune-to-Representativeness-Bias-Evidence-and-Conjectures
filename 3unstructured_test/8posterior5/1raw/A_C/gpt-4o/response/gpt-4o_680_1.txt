To use Bayes' rule and calculate \( P(H|E) \), where \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a particular field, and \( E \) is the evidence given in the personality sketch, we need to follow these steps:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) would be common for all hypotheses, it acts as a normalizing factor. Therefore, we will focus on estimating \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \) for each field and use them to determine \( P(H|E) \).

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of a graduate student majoring in computer science. This is generally high considering the popularity of this field.
   - Let's assume: \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.30 \)

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of the evidence given Adam is in computer science.
   - Adam's traits such as high intelligence and problem-solving skills are common in computer science, but his love for nature and animals is not typical.
   - Let's assume: \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.20 \)

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of the evidence given Adam is not in computer science.
   - Considering how specific his love for nature and animals is, this is likely higher since it fits more with non-CS fields.
   - Let's assume: \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.50 \)

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.20 \cdot 0.30 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.06 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of a graduate student majoring in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common than computer science.
   - Let's assume: \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.10 \)

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of the evidence given Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field.
   - Let's assume: \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.70 \)

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of the evidence given Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Considering Adam's specific traits: love for nature, animals, and his quiet disposition, this is lower.
   - Let's assume: \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.30 \)

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.70 \cdot 0.10 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.07 \]

To normalize the probabilities, we now compare the proportions:

- For computer science: \(P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.06\)
- For agricultural and veterinary science: \(P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.07\)

Let's normalize these values:

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.07} \approx 0.46
\]
\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.06 + 0.07} \approx 0.54
\]

Now, let's present this in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": 0.46,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.54
