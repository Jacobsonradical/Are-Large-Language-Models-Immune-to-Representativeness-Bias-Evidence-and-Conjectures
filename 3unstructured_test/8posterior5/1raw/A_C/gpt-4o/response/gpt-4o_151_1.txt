To answer your question, I'll follow these steps:

1. Estimate \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in a specific field.
4. Use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \): The probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that the total does not need to add up to 1, we will use a qualitative assessment of the probabilities.

**Computer Science:**

1. \( P(H) \): Let's assume there is a moderate likelihood that Adam could be enrolled in computer science, due to the high number of students in this field (~0.3).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits like curiosity, intelligence, and solving puzzles might fit well with computer science students (~0.4).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of having these personality traits if he is not in computer science is moderate (~0.2).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

1. \( P(H) \): There might be a lower prior probability here due to fewer students generally choosing this specific field (~0.1).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals fit very well with this field (~0.7).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of these personality traits if he is not in this field is lower (~0.2).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.07}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is a constant for normalization and not needed for comparison:

{
  "computer science": \(\approx 0.12\),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\approx 0.07\)
}

While actual values of \( P(E) \) can affect the final probabilities, the comparative likelihood suggests Adam is slightly more likely to be in computer science based on this qualitative assessment. However, the strong correlation of his personality with agricultural and veterinary science should not be understated, even if fewer people are enrolled in that field.

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
