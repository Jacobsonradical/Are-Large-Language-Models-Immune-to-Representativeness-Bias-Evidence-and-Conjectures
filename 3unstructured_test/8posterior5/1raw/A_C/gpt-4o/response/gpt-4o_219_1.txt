To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) if hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \). For our purposes, this can be simplified using \( P(E) \approx P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \).

Let's break it down for each field:

### Field: Computer Science
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Since we lack specific information, we'll treat it as moderate. Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability of the evidence given Adam is in computer science. Adam's profile (love for nature, empathy, animals, abstract concepts) doesn't strongly align with typical computer science traits, so we might consider it moderate-to-low. Let’s assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): The probability of the evidence given Adam is not in computer science. There's a higher chance of these traits fitting other fields. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \).

### Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since this aligns well with Adam's traits, we'll set it higher. Let’s assume \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The probability of the evidence given Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science. Adam's traits align well with this field. Let’s assume \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.7 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The probability of the evidence given Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science. There are other fields that align with his traits, but less so. Let’s assume \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.3 \).

Given these assumptions:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}})P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{AVS}})P(\neg H_{\text{AVS}}) \]

Let’s calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) \approx (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.8) + (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.04 + 0.32 + 0.07 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.7 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Rule for each field:

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.057 \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.07}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \approx 0.1 \]

So the probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.057,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.1
}
