To compute \( P(H|E) \), where \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a particular field, we will use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both fields, it will cancel out when comparing the probabilities, allowing us to compare \( P(H|E) \) directly using the known probabilities \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Judging the Probabilities:**
   - **\( P(H) \) (Prior probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science)**:  
     Graduate students in agriculture and veterinary sciences are relatively less compared to some larger fields like computer science, but it's still a significant number. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \) (5%).

   - **\( P(E|H) \) (Probability of Adam's personality traits given he is in agricultural and veterinary science):**
     Adam's traits closely align with typical interests and personality types in this field. His curiosity about nature, empathy, appreciation for the hard work and love for animals strongly suggest this match. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \) (90%).

   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of Adam's personality traits given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science):**
     These traits are less common, though not unheard of, in other fields. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \) (10%).

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.9 \cdot 0.05 + 0.1 \cdot 0.95} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.095} = \frac{0.045}{0.14} \approx 0.321 \]

### Computer Science

1. **Judging the Probabilities:**
   - **\( P(H) \) (Prior probability of being in computer science):**  
     Computer Science is a very common field of study for graduate students in the U.S. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.25 \) (25%).

   - **\( P(E|H) \) (Probability of Adam's personality traits given he is in computer science):**
     These personality traits are less aligned with computer science, which typically focuses more on abstract thinking and problem-solving, but less on empathy, nature, and animals. However, his intelligence and problem-solving skills fit. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \) (30%).

   - **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of Adam's personality traits given he is not in computer science):**
     As before, these traits are slightly more common in fields other than computer science. Thus, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.25 \) (25%).

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.3 \cdot 0.25 + 0.25 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.1875} = \frac{0.075}{0.2625} \approx 0.286 \]

### Final Values
Given the calculations above, the approximate values for \( P(H|E) \) are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.321,
