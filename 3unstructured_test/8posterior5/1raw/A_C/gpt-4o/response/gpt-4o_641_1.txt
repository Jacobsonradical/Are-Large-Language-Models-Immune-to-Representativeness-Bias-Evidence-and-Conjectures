To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine \(P(H)\)**: the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. **Determine \(P(E|H)\)**: the probability that Adam's personality sketch \(E\) would be true if he were enrolled in that field \(H\).
3. **Determine \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: the probability that Adam's personality sketch \(E\) would be true if he were not enrolled in that field \(H\).
4. **Bayes' Rule**:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

Given that we are not provided with exact numerical probabilities in the problem, we can make educated estimates based on the provided personality sketch.

### Step-by-step Estimations:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\(P(H)\)**: Let's assume a not-so-high but reasonable prior for being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Estimate: 0.1 (10%)

2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: The personality sketch is highly consistent with someone in agricultural and veterinary science, given the nature-related curiosity, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
   - Estimate: 0.8 (80%)

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The probability of having such a personality sketch outside this field is lower but still possible.
   - Estimate: 0.2 (20%)

#### Computer Science

1. **\(P(H)\)**: Computer science is a common graduate field of specialization.
   - Estimate: 0.2 (20%)

2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: The personality sketch, suggesting high intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts, aligns moderately well with computer science. However, it lacks some consistency regarding the subject's nature-related curiosity and empathy.
   - Estimate: 0.3 (30%)

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The probability of having such a personality sketch outside this field is comparatively higher, particularly matched with fields involving nature and animals.
   - Estimate: 0.7 (70%)

### Computation Using Bayes' Rule

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{(0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.2 \times 0.9)} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.3077
\]

#### Computer Science

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{(0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.7 \times 0.8)} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.56} = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \approx 0.0968
\]
