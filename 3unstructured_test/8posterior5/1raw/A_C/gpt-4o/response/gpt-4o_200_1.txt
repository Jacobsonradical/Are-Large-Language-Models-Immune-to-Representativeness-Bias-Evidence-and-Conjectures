Sure, let's go through the Bayesian inference for each field. Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field H.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence E given that Adam is enrolled in the field H.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence E given that Adam is not enrolled in the field H.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence E.

For simplicity, we assume reasonable values for these probabilities based on the description of Adam. However, exact numeric probabilities are often difficult to determine without additional data, so we'll make reasoned estimations. 

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science: Assume a moderate prevalence, let's say 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch occurs if he is enrolled in computer science: Considering his interest in puzzles and high intelligence, let's assign a value of 0.4.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is not in computer science: Given other fields could also fit this sketch well, let's assign a value of 0.3.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science: Assume a lower prevalence, let's say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch occurs if he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science: Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, let's assign a value of 0.7.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is not in agricultural and veterinary science: Given this specific fit of interests, let's assign a value of 0.4.

Now let's compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field.

### Computer Science
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.32 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.25 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.36 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.43 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.43} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.43} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \approx 0.163 \]

Given these calculations, here are the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.163
}
