To compute \(P(H|E)\), we need to use Bayes' Rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, we need to estimate:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in a specific field.

We will estimate these probabilities for both "agricultural and veterinary science" and "computer science."

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\(P(H)\)**: The base rate probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it's relatively low. Let's assign \(P(H) = 0.05\) (5%).

2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, this personality sketch aligns well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign \(P(E|H) = 0.7\) (70%).

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Given that these characteristics are somewhat specialized but could be found in other fields as well, let's assign \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.1\) (10%).

4. **\(P(E)\)**: The total probability of the personality sketch \(E\) irrespective of the field. We can compute it as follows:
   
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   
   \[
   P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.035 + 0.095 = 0.13
   \]

5. **\(P(H|E)\)** for agricultural and veterinary science:
   
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.13} = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \approx 0.269
   \]

### Computer Science

1. **\(P(H)\)**: The base rate probability of a graduate student being in computer science. Let's assume it's relatively high compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign \(P(H) = 0.15\) (15%).

2. **\(P(E|H)\)**: Given that Adam is good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoys solving puzzles, these characteristics align well with computer science. Let's assign \(P(E|H) = 0.5\) (50%).

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The probability of having Adam's personality sketch if he is not in computer science. Considering these traits can be present in many fields of study, let's assign \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.15\) (15%).

4. **\(P(E)\)**: The total probability of the personality sketch \(E\) irrespective of the field. We can compute it as follows:
   
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   
   \[
   P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.15) + (0.15 \cdot 0.85) = 0.075 + 0.1275 = 0.2025
   \]

5. **\(P(H|E)\)** for computer science:
   
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.15}{0.2025} = \frac{0.075}{0.2025} \approx 0.37
   \]
