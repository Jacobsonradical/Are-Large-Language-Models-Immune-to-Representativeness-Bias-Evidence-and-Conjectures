To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), where \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field, \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in that field, and \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch.

Given our fields of interest:
1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
2. Computer Science

Let's assess the priors and likelihoods for these fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H_agriculture)**: This is the prior probability. Given a broad distribution of graduate fields, let's assume the probability of Adam being in this field to be moderate but not too high, say around 0.05.

**P(E|H_agriculture)**: The personality sketch fits well with someone in this field. Curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work suggest a high likelihood, let's say 0.6.

**P(E|\neg H_agriculture)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch if Adam is not in this field. Considering the sketch could fit other fields as well, let's assign it a moderate probability, say 0.3. 

Now calculate:

\( P(H_{agriculture}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agriculture}) \cdot P(H_{agriculture})}{P(E)} \)

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor and summed over all possible hypotheses, it's consistent across hypotheses, simplifying our relative comparisons.

### Computer Science

**P(H_computer_science)**: For computer science, assuming a broad prior distribution, we can assign it a higher prior due to the popularity and broad applicability of the field, say 0.2.

**P(E|H_computer_science)**: The personality sketch is less directly fitting for computer science. While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant, the focus on nature and animals is less so. Let's give it 0.2.

**P(E|\neg H_computer_science)**: The likelihood of seeing this personality outside computer science may be higher given Adamâ€™s empathy and nature-oriented interests could fit numerous other fields. For this, let's use 0.35.

Now calculate:

\( P(H_{computer_science}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{computer_science}) \cdot P(H_{computer_science})}{P(E)} \)

### Comparative Values

Though we haven't explicitly calculated \( P(E) \), we can estimate and rank the relative posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{agriculture}|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.05 = 0.03 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{computer_science}|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04 \]

Now we normalize roughly (assuming only these two fields considered explicitly):

\[
P(H_{agriculture}|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.04} \approx 0.428 
\]
\[
P(H_{computer_science}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.03 + 0.04} \approx 0.571 
\]

Hence,

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.428,
  "computer science": 0.571
}
```

Note that these are simplified values based on our assumptions and relative scaling. Other fields and exact normalization could shift these probabilities further.
