Sure, let's use Bayes' rule to find the probabilities. We'll denote:

- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) as the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H|E) \) as the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch.

Since we're given two specific fields, we'll estimate these probabilities based on the personality traits described.

### For Computer Science:
1. **P(H):** Let's assume that the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in computer science is moderately high, given the popularity of the field. We'll estimate it as \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

2. **P(E|H):** Given his love for solving puzzles and high intelligence, it seems reasonably likely that someone with these traits could be in computer science. However, traits like empathy and a deep love for animals are not specifically indicative of this field but also not contradictory, so we’ll set \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Given that the remaining fields would cover a broad range of disciplines, and that his traits seem more aligned with something like environmental or veterinary sciences, it's less likely we'd see this personality if he wasn't in computer science. Estimating \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll calculate the proportional values:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.3 = 0.15 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **P(H):** Let's assume the prior probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science is lower, given the field's lower general enrollment compared to computer science. We'll estimate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H):** Given his deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy, it is highly likely his traits align with this field. We'll set \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** Given the personality sketch strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science, it's less likely we'd observe this personality in other fields. We’ll set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll calculate the proportional values:
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

### Normalizing the Probabilities:
We need to normalize these proportional values to get valid probabilities between 0 and 1.

Total proportional values:
\[ 0.15 + 0.08 = 0.23 \]

Normalized probabilities:
\[ P(H|E)_{computer\ science} = \frac{0.15}{0.23} \approx 0.65 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science} = \frac{0.08}{0.23} \approx 0.35 \]

Thus, our final estimates are:

{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35
}

Please note that these are rough estimates based on assumed probabilities and given information.
