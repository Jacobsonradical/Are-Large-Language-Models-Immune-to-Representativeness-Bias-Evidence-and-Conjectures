To apply Bayes' rule for calculating the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to estimate the following components:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the given personality sketch if Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam is not enrolled in that field.

We apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) will be a constant for all fields being compared, we can ignore it for comparison purposes and focus on the numerator:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's estimate these components based on the given sketch and general knowledge:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Assuming that graduate students are equally likely to be in any field (which may not be entirely accurate), this could be a small probability since fewer students are in this field compared to others.
  \[
  P(H) \approx 0.05
  \]
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) align well with this field.
  \[
  P(E|H) \approx 0.7
  \]
- **P(E|\neg H)**: These traits could be present in students from several other fields, not just Agricultural and Veterinary Science, but less so than in this specific field.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3
  \]

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Given the popularity of computer science and the large number of graduate students in the field, this prior could be higher.
  \[
  P(H) \approx 0.25
  \]
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's warm heart, empathy, and love for nature are less strongly associated with computer science.
  \[
  P(E|H) \approx 0.1
  \]
- **P(E|\neg H)**: These traits might be common outside the field of Computer Science.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4
  \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule for both fields while normalizing for comparative purposes:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[
P(\text{Agri}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Agri}) \cdot P(\text{Agri}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035
\]

#### Computer Science
\[
P(\text{CS}|E) \propto P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.025
\]

Normalized for comparison:
\[
P(\text{Agri}|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.025} \approx 0.583
\]
\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.035 + 0.025} \approx 0.417
\]

The comparative probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are approximately:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.583,
  "computer science": 0.417
}
```

Note: These values are based on heuristic assumptions and subjective estimates, not empirical data. Adjusting the priors and likelihoods based on more specific information can yield more accurate probabilities.
