To compute the probabilities P(H|E) for Adam being enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science based on the given personality sketch E, we need to follow the Bayesian formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we will be comparing the relative probabilities for both fields, we can focus on the proportional relationship without needing the denominator \(P(E)\). This leads us to consider:

\[ P(H|E) \proportional P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need some estimated values for \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\):

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch E given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.

**For Computer Science:**

1. **P(H for Computer Science)**: Since computer science is a common graduate field, let's assign a moderate prior, say \(P(H) = 0.2\).
2. **P(E|H for Computer Science)**: Given Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, this likelihood is somewhat moderate, say \(P(E|H) = 0.3\).
3. **P(E|\neg H for Computer Science)**: Given the personality sketch does not strongly indicate computer science, let's assign a lower value, say \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.1\).

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

1. **P(H for Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: This field is less common but not rare, let's assign \(P(H) = 0.1\).
2. **P(E|H for Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, this likelihood is quite high, say \(P(E|H) = 0.7\).
3. **P(E|\neg H for Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: Given the personality sketch strongly matches this field, let's assign a lower probability for not fitting other fields, say \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.3\).

Now, we calculate the posterior probabilities proportional to:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \proportional P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \proportional P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

Despite not being normalized, these values give us relative strengths of the hypotheses.

Given these, we can normalize the posterior probabilities to ensure they sum to 1 (considering only these two options):

Propagating the constants, let's normalize roughly:

\[ P(H|E \text{ for CS}) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.07} = 0.462 \]
\[ P(H|E \text{ for Agriculture/Veterinary}) \approx \frac{0.07}{0.06 + 0.07} = 0.538 \]

For simplicity:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.462,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.538
}
```

These values indicate that, given Adam's personality sketch, it is slightly more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than computer science.
