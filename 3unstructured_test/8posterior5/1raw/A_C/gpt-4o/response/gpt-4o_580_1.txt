To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor and is the same for all fields, we simplify the calculation and focus on the relative probabilities.

Let's first identify each of the components needed for Bayes' rule:

1. **\( P(H) \) - Prior probability of being enrolled in a specific field.**
   - For simplicity, we can assume that without specific prior knowledge, the fields might have equal initial prior probabilities, so \( P(H) \) can be considered as roughly equal. However, intuitively, fewer students might be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Computer Science. Let's take some educated guesses about their relative priors.

2. **\( P(E|H) \) - Probability of the personality sketch given the field.**
   - The sketch suggests Adam is very empathetic, curious about nature and animals, which aligns well with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - The abstract concepts understanding aligns with Computer Science, but the warm heart and love for animals may be less relevant.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) - Probability of the personality sketch given he's not enrolled in the specific field.**
   - This depends on how likely any random graduate student would fit the personality sketch provided.

### Estimations:

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Let's assume this is relatively less common, say 0.1.
   - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \): More common, say 0.3.

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: The sketch highly matches the field, \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.8 \).
   - For Computer Science: Less alignment, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.4 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - We consider this as the average likelihood of any graduate fitting this profile across all possible fields. Since the personality sketch aligns more closely with Agricultural and Veterinary Science and less so with Computer Science, letâ€™s take it to be around 0.3.

### Applying Bayes Rule:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

**Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

Finally, to express the probabilities in a form as per the question:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.12
}
```

Please note, these values are illustrative and based on assumed priors and likelihoods for simplicity. For more accurate results, actual data and more precise priors should be used.
