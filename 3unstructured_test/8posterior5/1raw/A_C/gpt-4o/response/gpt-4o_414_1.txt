To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the denominator \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses and will be normalized out when comparing among different hypotheses, we'll primarily focus on the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Let's denote \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field, \( P(E|H) \) as the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field, and \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is not in that field.

Based on the provided personality sketch, Adam has:
- A genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- A quiet disposition
- A fondness for solving puzzles
- Warmth, empathy, and a love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- A strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

### Estimations:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that an average graduate student is in this field might be relatively low compared to more conventional fields like computer science, in general; I'll estimate it to be 0.05.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having these characteristics if he is in agricultural and veterinary science could be quite high given his love for animals, nature, and understanding of hard work and dedication; I'll estimate this to be 0.8.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having these characteristics if he is not in agricultural and veterinary science will be lower; let's estimate this to be 0.4 (since his traits could align with other fields too but less clearly so).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

#### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that an average graduate student is in computer science will likely be higher; I'll estimate it to be 0.2.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having these characteristics if he is in computer science could be moderate. His love for solving puzzles and high intelligence aligns but a deep appreciation for nature and animals might not be as strong a match; let's estimate this to be 0.5.
- **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having these characteristics if he is not in computer science may be similar to the general likelihood of these characteristics across fields; let's estimate this to be 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]

### Normalized Probabilities (approximately):

We normalize within the context of only these two fields:

\[ P(H|E \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.1} = \frac{0.04}{0.14} = 0.2857 \]

\[ P(H|E \text{ for computer science}) \approx \frac{0.1}{0.04 + 0.1} = \frac{0.1}{0.14} = 0.7143 \]

### Conclusion:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2857,
  "computer science": 0.7143
}
```

Note that these values are proportional probabilities and would be subject to adjustment if we consider other potential fields Adam could be enrolled in.
