Sure, let's go step-by-step. We'll use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), which requires us to estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch of Adam given that he is enrolled in the specific field.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch of Adam given that he is not enrolled in the specific field.

Let's start with the first field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Let's assume there's an equal probability of Adam being enrolled in any given field, as we don't have specific data. However, agricultural and veterinary science might have fewer students overall compared to fields like computer science.
   - Estimate: \( P(H)_{\text{agri}} = 0.1 \)

2. **Probability of E given H \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and loves animals, which fits well.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H)_{\text{agri}} \approx 0.7 \)

3. **Probability of E given not H \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Consider how many other fields fit Adam's personality. Many fields might not fit as well, but others like biology or environmental science might.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{agri}} \approx 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) can be broken down as:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H)P(H) + P(E | \neg H)P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E)_{\text{agri}} = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34 \]

So:

\[ P(H | E)_{\text{agri}} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.206 \]

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Based on current trends, more students are likely in computer science.
   - Estimate: \( P(H)_{\text{cs}} = 0.2 \)

2. **Probability of E given H \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which fits computer science well, though other aspects like the love for nature and animals are less related.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|H)_{\text{cs}} \approx 0.5 \)

3. **Probability of E given not H \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - This remains relatively similar to the first case.
   - Estimate: \( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{cs}} \approx 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(E)_{\text{cs}} = (0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.1 + 0.24 = 0.34 \]

So:

\[ P(H | E)_{\text{cs}} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \approx 0.294 \]

### Results:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.206,
  "computer science": 0.294
}
```

These values indicate that given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood of him being in computer science is higher compared to agricultural and veterinary science, but the answer doesn't sum to 1 as expected due to the normalization and inclusion of other possible fields.
