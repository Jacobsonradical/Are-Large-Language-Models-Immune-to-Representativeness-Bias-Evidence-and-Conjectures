To evaluate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field based on the given personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break this down step by step for both "agricultural and veterinary science" and "computer science".

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that any given graduate student could be in agricultural and veterinary science. 
   - Given the diversity in graduate fields, let's assume a modest prior. For simplicity, let's set this at 0.10.
  
2. **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is studying agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given his love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, we hypothesize that Adam fits well in this field.
   - Let's estimate this probability to be 0.80.
  
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science, but in any other field.
   - Since there are many fields that value curiosity, intelligence, and empathy, but not all fields directly correlate with nature, plants, and animals, this might be lower.
   - Let's estimate this probability to be 0.20.

### Computer Science

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that any given graduate student could be in computer science.
   - Computing is a popular field, so we might assign a slightly higher prior probability. For simplicity, let's set this at 0.20.
  
2. **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is studying computer science.
   - Given Adam's interest in puzzles and high intelligence, it’s plausible, but the nature and animal focus doesn't directly align.
   - Let's estimate this probability to be 0.50.
  
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in computer science, but in any other field.
   - This could be considered similar to the agricultural and veterinary science scenario.
   - Let's estimate this probability to be 0.30.

### Calculating P(H|E)

We'll use the normalization factor \( P(E) \), but since we're holding that constant and looking for relative likelihoods, we'll focus on the numerator of Bayes' formula.

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's compute these:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.80 \times 0.10 = 0.08 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.50 \times 0.20 = 0.10 \]

Now we can see that the probability is higher for computer science relative to agricultural and veterinary science, based on our assumed probabilities.

Converting these proportions into probabilities (not necessarily summing to 1 due to the normalization factor not being applied here), we get:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.10
