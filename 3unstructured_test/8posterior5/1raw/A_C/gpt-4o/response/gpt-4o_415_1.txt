To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science, given the personality sketch \( E \), we'll use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are ultimately interested in comparing \( P(H|E) \) for different fields rather than in the absolute values, we will focus on the underlying components:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam would have personality traits \( E \) if he were enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam would have personality traits \( E \) if he were not enrolled in that field.

We'll assume general values for these probabilities based on the given personality sketch and typical characteristics associated with the fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \) (agricultural and veterinary science): This field is not the most common for graduate students, but it's not extremely rare either. Let's assume a moderate prior probability.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, the likelihood of exhibiting personality traits \( E \) if Adam were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is quite high.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): These traits might still exist without being in this field, but they wouldn't be as strongly predicted.

### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \) (computer science): This is a very common field for graduate students, so we might consider a higher prior probability for this field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's intelligence and problem-solving abilities, there is a moderate likelihood of exhibiting \( E \) if Adam were enrolled in computer science. However, his empathy, love for nature, and animals may be less directly related.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Again, these traits might still exist without being in this field, but to a lesser degree compared with those in agricultural and veterinary science.

Now, let's assign some rough values:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - Prior \( P(H) = 0.05 \)
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
   - Complementary likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \) (since these traits can still be found outside this field but less likely)

2. Computer Science:
   - Prior \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \)
   - Complementary likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \) (as traits are more common and the field is broad)

Using Bayes' Theorem (ignoring the constant normalization factor \( P(E) \) for comparison purposes):

1. \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \)
2. \( P(\text{Computer Science} | E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.15 = 0.06 \)

Thus, the probabilities (without normalization) are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.06
}
```

These values indicate that, given the personality traits, while both fields are plausible, Adam is slightly more likely to be in computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
