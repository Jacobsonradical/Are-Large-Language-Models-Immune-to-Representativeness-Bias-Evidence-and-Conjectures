To calculate \(P(H|E)\) for each field, we use Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant, representing the total probability of observing evidence \(E\) under all hypotheses.

For simplicity, we'll assume some approximate values based on general understanding and the information given in the personality sketch.

### Computer Science

**Prior Probability (P(H)):**
- Computer Science is a very popular field for graduate students. Let's assume \(P(H)\) = 0.20.

**Likelihood (P(E|H)):**
- The personality sketch does not strongly indicate typical traits of a computer scientist. While intelligence and puzzle-solving are relevant, curiosity about nature and love for animals are less common. Let's assume \(P(E|H)\) = 0.10.

**P(E|\neg H):**
- This is the probability of observing Adam's traits in fields other than Computer Science. Given that many other fields could align better with Adam's traits, this could be relatively high. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 0.30.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Prior Probability (P(H)):**
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science is less common than Computer Science but still a significant field. Let's assume \(P(H)\) = 0.05.

**Likelihood (P(E|H)):**
- The personality sketch suggests a strong alignment with characteristics typical of this field (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, etc.). Let's assume \(P(E|H)\) = 0.60.

**P(E|\neg H):**
- This is again the probability of observing Adam's traits in fields other than Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given that other fields are less closely aligned, this probability drops. Let's assume \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 0.20.

### Normalizing Constant (P(E))

To find \(P(E)\), we sum the total probability of observing the evidence across all hypotheses (assuming two fields for simplification):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + ...\]

For simplicity, assuming only these two hypotheses, let's use:

\[ P(E) = (0.10 \cdot 0.20) + (0.60 \cdot 0.05) + \ldots\]

Computing the normalization constant can get complex without the exact figures, so we'll estimate the influence of the major fields.

### Applying Bayes' Rule

- For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{0.10 \cdot 0.20 + 0.60 \cdot 0.05} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.03} = \frac{0.02}{0.05} \approx 0.4 \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.60 \cdot 0.05}{0.10 \cdot 0.20 + 0.60 \cdot 0.05} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.02 + 0.03} = \frac{0.03}{0.05} \approx 0.6 \]

### Final Results

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These results indicate a higher probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science given the personality sketch provided.
