To determine the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the given hypotheses using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the complementary likelihoods \( P(E|\neg H) \).

### Computer Science Field

#### Priors
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): This is the probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
  - Considering the popularity of computer science among graduate students, we can estimate a moderate prior. Let's assume \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).

#### Likelihood
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in computer science.
  - A personality sketch showing a deep love for nature, animals, and strong empathy might be less common in computer science students, so let's assume a lower likelihood. Let's take \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.1 \).

#### Complementary Likelihood
- \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \): This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in any field other than computer science.
  - Given the many fields where empathy, an interest in nature, animals, and abstract thinking are valuable, we can assume this is higher. Suppose \( P(E|\neg H_{CS}) = 0.6 \).

Using Bayes' rule for computer science, we get:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \approx P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|\neg H_{CS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{CS}) \):
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.48 = 0.5 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.02}{0.5} = 0.04 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### Priors
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Given the specificity of the field, we could estimate it at a lower prior. Let's assume \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.05 \).

#### Likelihood
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
  - His strong empathy, love for animals, and nature fit this field well, so we can assume a higher likelihood. Let's use \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \).

#### Complementary Likelihood
- \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in any field other than agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Since many other fields could match elements of Adamâ€™s personality, this value might be moderately high. Suppose \( P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) = 0.55 \).

Using Bayes' rule for agricultural and veterinary science, we get:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \approx P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|\neg H_{AVS}) \cdot P(\neg H_{AVS}) \):
\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.55 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.5225 = 0.5625 \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.5625} = \frac{0.04}{0.5625} \approx 0.071 \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.071
}

Note: These values are based on assumptions and estimations for illustrative purposes. Actual probabilities may vary with more accurate priors and likelihoods.
