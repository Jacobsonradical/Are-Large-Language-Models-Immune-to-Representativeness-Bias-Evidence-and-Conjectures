To determine the probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to follow a structured approach. Let's compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field given:

1. **Computer Science**
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

We start with some approximations for the initial probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was in a given field of study.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was not in that field.

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H)_{\text{CS}} \)**: 
   Estimate the prior probability based on the popularity of computer science among graduate students. Let's assume this to be 0.15.

2. **\( P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \)**: 
   Consider the match between the personality sketch and typical computer science students. Curiosity and high intelligence fit well, but empathy and animal love might be less common. Let's estimate this as 0.20.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{CS}} \)**:
   This is the probability of Adam's personality traits given that he was not a computer science major. Since many fields could fit Adam's description, let's assume this to be relatively high, around 0.60.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \times P(H)_{\text{CS}}}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \)

\[ P(E) = (0.20 \times 0.15) + (0.60 \times 0.85) \approx 0.03 + 0.51 = 0.54 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.20 \times 0.15}{0.54} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.54} \approx 0.056 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H)_{\text{AVS}} \)**: 
   Estimate the prior probability for this less common field among graduate students. Let's assume this to be 0.05.

2. **\( P(E|H)_{\text{AVS}} \)**: 
   The match between the personality sketch and agricultural/veterinary students is strong, given his love for nature, animals, and empathy. Let's estimate this as 0.80.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H)_{\text{AVS}} \)**:
   The probability of Adam's personality traits given he was not an agricultural/veterinary major. For other fields, let's assume this to be around 0.50.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{AVS}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{AVS}} \times P(H)_{\text{AVS}}}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.05) + (0.50 \times 0.95) \approx 0.04 + 0.475 = 0.515 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{AVS}} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.05}{0.515} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.515} \approx 0.078 \]

Given the above calculations:

{
  "computer science": "0.056",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.078"
}
