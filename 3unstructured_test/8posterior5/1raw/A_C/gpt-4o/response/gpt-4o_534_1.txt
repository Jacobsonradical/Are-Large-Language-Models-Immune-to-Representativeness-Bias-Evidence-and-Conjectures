Let's first assess the components needed for the Bayesian calculation for each hypothesis:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)** (prior probability): Graduate fields in agricultural and veterinary science are less common than some other fields, but given Adam's interest in nature, animals, and empathy, it's reasonably likely.
    - Estimated P(H): 0.2 (or 20%)

- **P(E|H)** (likelihood of evidence given the hypothesis): Given Adam's traits fit well with agricultural and veterinary science, it's probable he's in this field.
    - Estimated P(E|H): 0.9 (or 90%)

- **P(E|¬H)** (likelihood of evidence given not the hypothesis): Assuming the pool of all other graduate fields, which might not fit Adam's traits as closely, we estimate the likelihood is lower.
    - Estimated P(E|¬H): 0.2 (or 20%)

### Computer Science
- **P(H)** (prior probability): Computer science is a very common graduate field, and while Adam's interest in puzzles aligns with this, his other interests don't match as directly with computer science.
    - Estimated P(H): 0.3 (or 30%)

- **P(E|H)** (likelihood of evidence given the hypothesis): While some of Adam's traits like problem-solving skills and high intelligence fit computer science, the other characteristics (empathy, love for nature and animals) don't fit as well.
    - Estimated P(E|H): 0.4 (or 40%)

- **P(E|¬H)** (likelihood of evidence given not the hypothesis): The pool of non-computer science fields is broad, making it slightly less likely that Adam’s traits fit any of them precisely.
    - Estimated P(E|¬H): 0.3 (or 30%)

Now, we can use Bayes' rule to calculate P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) = 0.18 + 0.16 = 0.34 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} = \frac{0.18}{0.34} \approx 0.529 \]

### Computer Science:

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.3) + (0.3 \cdot 0.7) = 0.12 + 0.21 = 0.33 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.33} = \frac{0.12}{0.33} \approx 0.364 \]
