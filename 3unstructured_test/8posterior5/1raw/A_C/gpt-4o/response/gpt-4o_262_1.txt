To estimate the values for the probabilities and apply Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps for both the fields of study: agricultural and veterinary science and computer science. Here is a systematic way to approach this:

1. **P(H) - The prior probability of H (Adam being enrolled in that field)**
   - This is a rough estimate of the probability that any given graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in a specific field.
  
2. **P(E|H) - The probability of observing the personality sketch E given H is true**
   - This considers how likely it is that someone with Adam’s personality traits would be studying in that field.
  
3. **P(E|¬H) - The probability of observing the personality sketch E given H is not true**
   - This considers the likelihood that someone with Adam’s traits would be in a different field.

4. **P(H|E) - The posterior probability, which is what we are trying to compute.**

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We assume P(E) is the sum over all fields Adam could potentially be enrolled in, but since we are focusing only on two fields, we will simplify it by comparing relative probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability that a U.S. graduate student is in the agricultural and veterinary sciences is about 0.05 (since this is a specialized field).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s love for nature, animals, and his empathy, it is quite likely he would be in this field. Let’s estimate this as 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H)**: A rough estimate of the probability that someone with Adam's characteristics is in a different field. Given that there are many graduate fields where these traits might be less common, we can estimate this at 0.1.

### Computer Science
- **P(H)**: Let’s assume the prior probability that a U.S. graduate student is in computer science is about 0.15 (a more common field).
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, it’s plausible he could be in computer science, but his strong affinity for nature and animals make it less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary sciences. Let's estimate this as 0.3.
- **P(E|¬H)**: This would include all other fields Adam could be in where the traits might equally fit (including more likely fields like agricultural and veterinary sciences). Let’s estimate this as 0.15.

Applying Bayes' rule for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.1 \times (1 - 0.05)} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.095} = \frac{0.04}{0.135} \approx 0.296 \]

### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.15 \times (1 - 0.15)} = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.1275} = \frac{0.045}{0.1725} \approx 0.261 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "computer science": 0.261
}
