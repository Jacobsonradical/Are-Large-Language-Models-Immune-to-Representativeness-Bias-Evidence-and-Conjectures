To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch (denoted as \( P(H|E) \)), we will use Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote the probabilities for each involved term:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not in that field.

We'll assume:
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch. Since we only compare relative probabilities, \( P(E) \) can remain as a constant denominator and thus won't affect relative rankings.

### Computer Science
**Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: 
Graduate students in computer science fields are relatively numerous. A rough guess might be around 10%.

**Probability of Personality Sketch Given Field, \( P(E|H) \)**:
- Nature curiosity: Lower
- Puzzles: Higher
- Empathy for animals and warm-hearted: Lower
- Abstract concepts: Higher
- Hard work and dedication: Neutral

Given these traits, \( P(E|H) \) might be moderately low.

**Probability of Personality Sketch Given Not in Field, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
Assume that personality traits like Adam's are more typical in non-computer science fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: 
There are fewer graduate students in agricultural and veterinary programs, so we might guess closer to 5%.

**Probability of Personality Sketch Given Field, \( P(E|H) \)**:
- Nature curiosity: Very high
- Puzzles: Neutral
- Empathy for animals and warm-hearted: Very high
- Abstract concepts: Neutral to higher
- Hard work and dedication: High

Given these traits, \( P(E|H) \) might be quite high.

**Probability of Personality Sketch Given Not in Field, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
Assume that Adam's personality is less typical in non-agricultural and non-veterinary fields.

### Calculations
We'll estimate:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.5 \)

Given the priors:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.05 \)

We calculate:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

To determine relative probabilities without needing \( P(E) \):

\[ \frac{P(H_{\text{CS}}|E)}{P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.8 \times 0.05} = \frac{0.02}{0.04} = 0.5 \]

Hence, the relative likelihoods are:

{
  "computer science": "0.5 * p, where p > 0",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "p, where p > 0"
}

Given the relative measure \( p \), adjusting to intuitive numerical values:

{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67
}
