To analyze the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field of study given the personality sketch (denoted as \(E\)), we can apply Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, for simplicity, we'll use the following heuristic judgments for the required probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is not in that field.

We'll assume general priors and likelihoods for these fields, and since we only need the relative probabilities, the normalization factor \(P(E)\) can be omitted because we can recalibrate our results to the set of fields being considered here, even though they don't need to sum up to 1.

**For Computer Science:**

- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): Let's assume the prior probability that a random graduate student is in computer science is moderate. Let's say it's around 0.3 (30%).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and strong empathy, the likelihood that this personality matches a computer science student is relatively low. But his intelligence and abstract thinking skills might fit well. Let's say this is around 0.2 (20%).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{cs}}) \): The probability of the personality sketch fitting other fields (excluding computer science) is higher, considering his strong affinity for nature and animals. Let's give this a value of around 0.6 (60%).

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

- \( P(H_{\text{av})} \): We'll consider a smaller prior since fewer graduate students opt for agricultural and veterinary sciences. Let's say around 0.1 (10%).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{av})} \): Given Adam's strong love for nature, animals, and empathy, the likelihood is quite high that this personality sketch matches someone in this field. Let's assume 0.8 (80%).
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{av})} \): Other fields matching this personality aren't as likely but would still include something beyond agricultural and veterinary sciences. Let's assume 0.4 (40%).

Now, we'll calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \) and \( P(H_{\text{av}}|E) \):

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{av}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{av}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{av}}) \]

Normalizing to sum to the given fields:

\[ 
P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|H_{\text{av}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{av}})} 
= \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{(0.2 \cdot 0.3) + (0.8 \cdot 0.1)} 
= \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.08} 
= \frac{0.06}{0.14} 
\approx 0.429 
\]

\[ 
P(H_{\text{av}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{av}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{av}})}{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|H_{\text{av}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{av}})} 
= \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{(0.2 \cdot 0.3) + (0.8 \cdot 0.1)} 
= \frac{0.08}{0.06 + 0.08} 
= \frac{0.08}{0.14} 
\approx 0.571 
\]

So the computed posterior probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": "0.429",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.571"
}
