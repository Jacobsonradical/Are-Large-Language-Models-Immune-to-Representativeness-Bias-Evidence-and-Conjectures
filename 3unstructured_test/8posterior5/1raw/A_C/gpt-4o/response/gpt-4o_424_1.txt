To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). For simplification, we'll assume \( P(E) \) remains the same across all hypotheses, allowing us to compare the relative values directly.

### Estimations

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1):**

   - **\( P(H_1) \)**: This is the prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume \( P(H_1) \) is relatively modest given the range of graduate fields available. Estimate: 0.1
   - **\( P(E|H_1) \)**: Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it's highly likely that this field suits him. Estimate: 0.8
   - **\( P(E|\neg H_1) \)**: This is a bit trickier, but considering multiple other fields could also fit some aspects of his personality, like environmental science or biology. Estimate: 0.4

2. **Computer Science (H2):**

   - **\( P(H_2) \)**: This is the prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in Computer Science. Considering the popularity of this field, it might be relatively high. Estimate: 0.25
   - **\( P(E|H_2) \)**: Given Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, computer science is a plausible field, yet it is less directly related to his love for nature and animals. Estimate: 0.3
   - **\( P(E|\neg H_2) \)**: Again considering the general distribution of graduate fields that may fit Adam's profile. Estimate: 0.6

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Bayes' Rule is given by
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across all hypotheses, we focus on the numerator:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Calculations

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.3 \times 0.25 = 0.075 \]

### Comparison

To express these in a comparative format, we normalize these scores by their sum to get approximate probabilities:

Sum = \( 0.08 + 0.075 = 0.155 \)

Normalized probabilities:
- \( P(H_1|E) \) ≈ \( \frac{0.08}{0.155} \approx 0.516 \)
- \( P(H_2|E) \) ≈ \( \frac{0.075}{0.155} \approx 0.484 \)

While these probabilities should sum to 1, note these are relative probabilities for comparison purposes.

Therefore, the estimates are:
