Let's assess the probabilities and apply Bayes' Theorem:

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each specific field:

### Computer Science
- **P(H) (Prior Probability)**: The probability that a given graduate student is in computer science. Let's assume it's a common field, so we might choose \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- **P(E|H) (Likelihood)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science. Considering his traits (quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts), this likelihood is relatively high, say \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
- **P(E|\neg H) (Likelihood given the complement)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in computer science. Since these traits are not exclusive to computer science, they could be present across many fields, but perhaps at a lower rate, so let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H) (Prior Probability)**: The probability that a given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- **P(E|H) (Likelihood)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Considering his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, this likelihood is high, say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H) (Likelihood given the complement)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not in agricultural and veterinary science. Again, these traits are not exclusive but less likely compared to computer science, so letâ€™s hypothesize \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \), we can compute the probabilities.

### Computer Science
- **P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)**:
  \[
  P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times (1 - 0.2)) = 0.12 + 0.24 = 0.36
  \]
- **P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.36} = \frac{0.12}{0.36} = 0.33
  \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)**:
  \[
  P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.4 \times (1 - 0.05)) = 0.04 + 0.38 = 0.42
  \]
- **P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.42} = \frac{0.04}{0.42} \approx 0.095
  \]

The resulting probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.095
}

These probabilities do not sum to 1, which is fine since there are other graduate fields of specialization not considered here.
