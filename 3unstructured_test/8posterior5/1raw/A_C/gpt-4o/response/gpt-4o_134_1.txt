To solve this problem using Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the probabilities involved. Let's go through the steps for both fields.

### Step 1: Defining the Hypotheses
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science

### Step 2: Estimating the Probabilities
- \( P(H_1) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science
- \( P(H_2) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science

### Step 3: Estimating Likelihoods Given the Personality Sketch
- \( P(E|H_1) \): Probability of the personality sketch given Adam was enrolled in computer science
- \( P(E|H_2) \): Probability of the personality sketch given Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science
- \( P(E|\neg H_1) \): Probability of the personality sketch given Adam was not enrolled in computer science
- \( P(E|\neg H_2) \): Probability of the personality sketch given Adam was not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science

### Step 4: Applying Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \), the marginal likelihood, can be found using:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|\neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1) \]

Given the personality sketch, let's assume the following probabilities:

#### For Computer Science
- \( P(H_1) \approx 0.3 \): Prior probability that Adam was studying computer science (assuming a moderate interest among graduate students)
- \( P(E|H_1) \approx 0.2 \): Probability of having Adam's personality traits if he was in computer science, as computer science doesn't necessarily attract students with strong empathy or love for animals.
- \( P(E|\neg H_1) \approx 0.7 \): Probability of having his personality traits if he was not in computer science, because fields such as agricultural and veterinary science are more likely given his personality sketch.

Applying these to Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.7 \cdot 0.7} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.49} = \frac{0.06}{0.55} \approx 0.109 \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_2) \approx 0.1 \): Prior probability of being enrolled in this field among all possibilities.
- \( P(E|H_2) \approx 0.6 \): High likelihood of having Adam's personality traits in this field.
- \( P(E|\neg H_2) \approx 0.4 \): Lower probability of having these traits if not in agricultural and veterinary science.

Applying these to Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.36} = \frac{0.06}{0.42} \approx 0.143 \]

### Final Results
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.109,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.143
}
```

These results suggest Adam is more likely to be studying agricultural and veterinary science than computer science, given his personality sketch.
