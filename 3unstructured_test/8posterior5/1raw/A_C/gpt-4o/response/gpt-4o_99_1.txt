To determine the likelihoods, we can proceed through these steps:

1. Estimate **P(H)**: The overall probability that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. Estimate **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam, given he is in that field.
3. Estimate **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, given he is not in that field.

Using Bayes' Rule, we can compute:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We do not have exact numbers, but we can provide reasonable estimates based on the given personality sketch.

### Computer Science:
- **P(H)**: Graduate students in computer science make up a significant portion of the graduate student population, perhaps around 20-30%. We will estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.25 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Computer science students can have high intelligence and enjoy puzzles. However, Adams' strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are less directly related to computer science. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.20 \).
- **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of finding someone with Adam’s characteristics in any field other than computer science might be higher since empathy and love for nature and animals are not typical traits for computer science graduates. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.40 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(H)**: A smaller percentage of students are in this field, let's estimate about 5-10%. We will use \( P(H) \approx 0.075 \).
- **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam has a love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, which aligns very well with agricultural and veterinary sciences, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.70 \).
- **P(E|¬H)**: This remains as before, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.40 \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.075}{P(E)} = \frac{0.0525}{P(E)} \]

While we do not know \( P(E) \), we can still use these results to understand the relative probabilities.

Given these calculations, we can see that Adam's personality is significantly more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than computer science.

Let's summarize the estimates arbitrarily normalizing \( P(E) \):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.05 / P(E),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.0525 / P(E)
}
```

Expressed as relative conditions (not absolute calculations, as \( P(E) \) is not known but assumed to be constant for relative probability):

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.10",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.525"
}
```
