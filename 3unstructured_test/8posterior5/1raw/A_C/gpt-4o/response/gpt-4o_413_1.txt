To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to estimate:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given field \( H \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given not field \( H \).

To simplify the calculation, let's assume there is a total of five fields Adam could be enrolled in: computer science, agricultural and veterinary science, engineering, humanities, and social sciences. While this assumption isn't literally true, it will suffice for estimating the probabilities.

Since P(H) represents our general belief about Adam being in a given field before seeing his personality sketch, let's assume each of the five fields is equally probable initially (hence prior probability for each field is 1/5 = 0.2).

Now, considering \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \):

- For computer science:
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Unlikely given Adam's traits which align less with typical computer science characteristics, e.g., love for nature and animals. Let's estimate this as 0.1.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \): This includes all other fields equally, but since agricultural and veterinary science aligns better, let's estimate this as 0.7 (averaging lower likelihood for other fields).

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Highly likely given Adam’s personality traits. Let's estimate this as 0.8.
    - \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Includes the other fields less likely to perfectly align with Adam’s traits. Let's estimate this as 0.2 (since the majority of non-agricultural fields don't align well).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(H) \) = 0.2 for all fields:

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{(0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.8 \cdot 0.2)} = \frac{0.02}{0.18} \approx 0.111 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{(0.8 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.2)} = \frac{0.16}{0.20} = 0.8 \]
