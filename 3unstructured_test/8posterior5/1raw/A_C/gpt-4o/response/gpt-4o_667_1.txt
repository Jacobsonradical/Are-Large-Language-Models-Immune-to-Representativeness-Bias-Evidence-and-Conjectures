To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in that field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only comparing two fields and not considering other fields explicitly, the constant \( P(E) \) can be ignored for the purpose of comparison. We will focus on the numerators.

### Computer Science

**P(H):** Without specific enrollment data, we can assume \( P(H) \) is relatively balanced across different fields.

**P(E|H):** The personality sketch mentions traits like high intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving, which are relevant to computer science. However, there is no specific mention of a technological focus.

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability that someone with Adam's personality sketch is not in computer science. Given that Adam's interests align more with nature, animals, and empathy, this value might be relatively high.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H):** As previously stated, assuming balance.

**P(E|H):** The personality traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.

**P(E|\neg H):** The probability that someone with Adam's traits is not in agricultural and veterinary science. This might be relatively low given the strong alignment.

Now, let's hypothesize reasonable values (these are qualitative estimates and should ideally be based on empirical data):

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

### Justification

- **P(H for computer science)**: Let's assume a reasonably arbitrary prior \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).
- **P(E|H for computer science)**: Given that Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills align but there's no direct indication of technology, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \).
- **P(E|\neg H for computer science)**: Given the emphasis on nature and animals possibly pointing away from computer science, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \).

Combining these:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.4 \times 0.3 + 0.6 \times 0.7} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.42} = \frac{0.12}{0.54} \approx 0.22 \]


- **P(H for agricultural and veterinary science)**: Assume a prior \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).
- **P(E|H for agricultural and veterinary science)**: Given Adam's strong alignment with nature and animals, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
- **P(E|\neg H for agricultural and veterinary science)**: Because traits might align less strongly, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \).

Combining these:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{0.8 \times 0.3 + 0.3 \times 0.7} = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.21} = \frac{0.24}{0.45} \approx 0.53 \]

Please, note these are approximate values based on qualitative assessment:

{
  "computer science": 0.22,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.53
}
