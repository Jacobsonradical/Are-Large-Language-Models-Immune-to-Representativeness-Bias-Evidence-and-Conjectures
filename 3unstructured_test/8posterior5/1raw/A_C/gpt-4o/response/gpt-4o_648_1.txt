To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either Computer Science or Agricultural and Veterinary Science given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to utilize Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both calculations, we will focus on the relevant terms.

### Hypothesis: Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Considering the general population of graduate students:
   - Assume the probability of a graduate student being in computer science is approximately \( 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - While computer science students may have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, some of the traits (like a deep love for animals and nature) are less common. Let's assign a moderate likelihood, say \( 0.3 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Considering other fields, it seems reasonably likely that someone with these traits could be in other fields since empathy, love for animals, and nature are common in several areas. Let's assign \( 0.6 \).

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 * 0.2 + 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.48 = 0.54 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 * 0.2}{0.54} = \frac{0.06}{0.54} \approx 0.111 \]

### Hypothesis: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Considering the general population of graduate students:
   - Assume the probability is approximately \( 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems very likely he matches someone in this field. Let's assign a high likelihood, say \( 0.9 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Considering other fields, it seems reasonably likely that someone with these traits fits in other fields too. Let's assign \( 0.6 \). 

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 * 0.1 + 0.6 * 0.9 = 0.09 + 0.54 = 0.63 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 * 0.1}{0.63} = \frac{0.09}{0.63} \approx 0.143 \]

Now we can compile the results:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.143
}
