Sure, let's go through the evaluation of each hypothesis and calculate the probabilities step by step.

### Hypothesis Evaluation

1. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science. This might be based on general enrollment statistics. Let's assume it is moderately likely that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science since it's a common field.
     - \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
   
   - \( P(E | H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science.
     - Adam's empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature are not typical traits heavily associated with Computer Science students. However, his high intelligence and problem-solving skills are relevant.
     - \( P(E | H) = 0.4 \)
   
   - \( P(E | \neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in Computer Science.
     - Assuming the personality sketch could generally fit more naturally into fields other than Computer Science.
     - \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.6 \)
   
   - Using Bayes' Theorem:
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
     \]
     Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \),
     \[
     P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 = 0.08 + 0.48 = 0.56
     \]
     So,
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.56} = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \approx 0.143
     \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume this is less likely than Computer Science but still possible.
     - \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
   
   - \( P(E | H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
     - The traits like love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy are closely aligned with this field.
     - \( P(E | H) = 0.8 \)
   
   - \( P(E | \neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
     - Other fields might not align as well with the traits described in the personality sketch.
     - \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.4 \)
   
   - Using Bayes' Theorem:
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
     \]
     Since \( P(E) \) is already calculated as 0.56,
     \[
     P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.56} = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \approx 0.143
     \]

### Results

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.143,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.143
}
```

Both Computer Science and Agricultural and Veterinary Science have the same posterior probability given the provided personality sketch, reflecting the nuances and overlaps of traits that can apply to multiple fields.
