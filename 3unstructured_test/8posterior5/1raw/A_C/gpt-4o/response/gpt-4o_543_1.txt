To determine the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

Given that we are estimating relative probabilities, we'll assume \( P(E) \) is constant for both fields, so we'll focus on calculating the numerators \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: The probability of being in this field. Let's assume it's moderate since agricultural and veterinary science is a specialized, but important, field. So, let's say roughly 0.1.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he's in this field. Given his love for nature, plants, animals, strong empathy, and work dedication, this is high. Let's estimate it as 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch if he is not in this field. It seems less likely he has these traits in arbitrary fields, so we might estimate something like 0.2.

### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: The probability of being in this field. Let's assume it's relatively high given the popularity of computer science programs. So, say around 0.3.
- **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given he's in this field. While his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills fit, the rest about nature and animals doesn't. Let's estimate it as 0.3.
- **P(E|¬H)**: Similarly, if Adam is not in computer science, other fields might match his profile even less. Let's estimate 0.1.

Given the above, compute the unscaled \( P(H|E) \):

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \]

These represent our unscaled posterior probabilities. However, to answer in a strict value between 0 and 1 without normalization, we'll respond relative to each other under the fixed total.
