To estimate the probabilities, let's break it down as follows:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, without any additional information.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in each field.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in each field.

Let's walk through the reasoning for each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**P(H)**: The base rate or prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science fields is relatively low. For instance, let's estimate this as \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (this is a plausible value; actual values would depend on the specific institution's enrollment statistics).

**P(E|H)**: If Adam were enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, the described characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, high empathy) strongly align with typical traits that students in this field might have. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) should be high. Let's estimate this as \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

**P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science would be lower, as these traits might not be as common in other fields of study. Let's estimate this as \( P(E|¬H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence across all fields:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.95 \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.95) = 0.04 + 0.19 = 0.23 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.23} \approx 0.174 \]

### Computer Science

**P(H)**: The base rate or prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Computer Science is relatively high. For instance, let's estimate this as \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (again, assuming plausible enrollment rates).

**P(E|H)**: If Adam were enrolled in Computer Science, traits such as high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts fit well, but the traits related to empathy, love for animals, and nature might not fit as strongly. Let's estimate this as \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

**P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in Computer Science would be higher than in the previous case but still relatively low. Let's estimate this as \( P(E|¬H) = 0.25 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.25 \cdot 0.8) = 0.08 + 0.2 = 0.28 \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.28} \approx 0.286 \]

So the results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.174,
  "computer science": 0.286
}
```

These results imply that based on the given personality sketch, there is a higher posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science than in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, though neither probability is overwhelmingly high.
