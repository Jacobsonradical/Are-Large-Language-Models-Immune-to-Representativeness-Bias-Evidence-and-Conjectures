To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is constant across different hypotheses and isn't known, we'll use the relative values of \( P(H|E) \) for comparison through:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's analyze for each field:

1. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(H_{cs}) \): The base rate probability that Adam, as a U.S. graduate student, is in computer science. Let's assume a moderate base rate: 0.2 (20%).
   - \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): The likelihood that Adam, given his personality sketch, is in computer science. He possesses high intelligence and likes solving puzzles, which fits a computer science profile. Moderately high: 0.6 (60%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{cs}) \): The likelihood that Adam has the described personality sketch but is in a different field. Given the empathy, love for nature, and animals might be more common outside of CS. Low: 0.2 (20%).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(H_{avs}) \): The base rate probability that Adam, as a U.S. graduate student, is in agricultural and veterinary science. Assume a lower base rate: 0.05 (5%).
   - \( P(E|H_{avs}) \): The likelihood that Adam, given his personality sketch, is in agricultural and veterinary science. His love for nature and animals strongly fits this profile. High: 0.9 (90%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H_{avs}) \): The likelihood that Adam has the described personality sketch but isn't in agricultural and veterinary science. Lower but some other field might still fit: 0.3 (30%).

Now, applying Bayes' rule in the absolute sense (without normalization factor \( P(E) \)):

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H_{cs}) \times P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.2 \times 0.6 = 0.12 \)
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_{avs}) \times P(E|H_{avs}) = 0.05 \times 0.9 = 0.045 \)

This value is not normalized, but it gives a comparative sense that:

{
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045
}

Based on these values, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science relative to agricultural and veterinary sciences, given his personality sketch.
