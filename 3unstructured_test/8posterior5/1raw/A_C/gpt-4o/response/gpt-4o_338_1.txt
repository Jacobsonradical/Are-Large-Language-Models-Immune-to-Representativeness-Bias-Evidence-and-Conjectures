To use Bayes' theorem to compute the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in different fields based on the given personality sketch, we need to start by defining the relevant probabilities.

Bayes' theorem is formulated as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \).

For this analysis, we will separately consider each hypothesis \( H \) (enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or computer science) and estimate these probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that a graduate student might enroll in agricultural and veterinary science without any additional information. Let's approximate this as 0.05 for the purposes of this analysis.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his personality sketch closely aligns with this field, we might estimate this to be 0.6.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) if Adam is not enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given this is very general and could fit a range of fields, we might place a rough estimate of 0.2.

### Computer Science

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that a graduate student might enroll in computer science. As a popular field, let's approximate this as 0.2.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Although he has a high intelligence beneficial for the field, some aspects like empathy and love for animals are less relevant, so this might be 0.3.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) if Adam is not enrolled in computer science. Similar to the reasoning above, this might be about 0.2.

Now, we need to compute \( P(E) \) which is a normalization factor but since we'll only be comparing ratios, we can directly compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field without explicitly calculating \( P(E) \).

### Calculation for Agricultural and Veterinary Science

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Since we're focused on relative comparisons:
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.05}{0.2} = 0.15
\]

### Calculation for Computer Science

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Since we're focused on relative comparisons:
\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.2} = 0.3
\]

### Final Probabilities

\[
\{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.15,
  "computer science": 0.3
\}
\]
