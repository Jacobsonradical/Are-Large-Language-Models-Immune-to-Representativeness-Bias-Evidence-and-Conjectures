Given the context and the personality sketch of Adam, we can assess the probabilities for his enrollment in computer science as follows:

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Assuming a general distribution of graduate students across various fields, let's assume that the proportion of students enrolled in computer science is around 0.2 (or 20%).

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of E (the personality sketch) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science. If Adam's characteristics match somewhat with what we might expect from someone in this field, we might estimate this to be fairly moderate. For example, programmers and scientists often exhibit high intelligence and problem-solving skills, which fits well with Adam's profile. Let's estimate this to be around 0.5.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of E given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science. Considering that Adam's profile (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) might fit well with biology, environmental science, or similar fields, we'll assume these characteristics are somewhat less likely to fit computer science specifically. Let's estimate this to be around 0.3.

Plugging these into Bayes' Rule, we can compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.34 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.294 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science is approximately 0.294 (or 29.4%).
