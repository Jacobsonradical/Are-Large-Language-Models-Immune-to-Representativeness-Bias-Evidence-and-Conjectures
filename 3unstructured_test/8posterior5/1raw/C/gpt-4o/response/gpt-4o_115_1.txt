To apply Bayes' rule for the given problem, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

Finally, using these probabilities, we compute \( P(H|E) \), the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, via Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Now, let's provide some reasonable estimates for the necessary probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is relatively common among graduate students. Suppose we estimate this to be around 20% (0.2).

2. \( P(E|H) \): Computer scientists can have a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoy solving puzzles, and have high intelligence. However, the combination of Adam's characteristics might be slightly less common. Estimate this to be around 30% (0.3).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): There are many fields other than computer science where Adam's personality sketch might be more likely, such as biology, environmental science, etc. Estimate this to be around 10% (0.1).

Now we can compute:

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14 \]

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.14} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.429 (or 42.9%).

Here is the final formatted answer:
