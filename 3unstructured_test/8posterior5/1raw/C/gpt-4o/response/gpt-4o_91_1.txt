To answer the question, we need to follow Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) given \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \). Letâ€™s start by estimating these probabilities.

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Since the probability of being enrolled in any specific field among all possible fields is usually quite low, let's take \( P(H) \) as 0.1 (assuming there are many fields and computer science is reasonably popular).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of the personality sketch (E) given that Adam is in computer science. Given Adam's traits, such as high intelligence, liking for solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, it is reasonably consistent with someone in computer science. Let's estimate this as 0.7.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of the personality sketch (E) given that Adam is not in computer science. Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals might suggest a field like biology or environmental science. However, traits like high intelligence and abstract thinking are present across many fields. Let's estimate this as 0.3.

Now, we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, let's determine \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Where \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \).

So,

\[ P(E) = 0.7 \times 0.1 + 0.3 \times 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.34 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2059 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.2059.
