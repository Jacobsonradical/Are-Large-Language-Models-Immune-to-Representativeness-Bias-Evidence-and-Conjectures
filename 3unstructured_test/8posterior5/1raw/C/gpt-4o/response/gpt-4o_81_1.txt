To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, let's follow the steps.

**Step 1: Assign initial probabilities (priors and likelihoods):**

We need to assign probabilities to the following:
- \( P(H) \): The probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing E (personality sketch) given that H (Adam is in computer science) is true.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing E (personality sketch) given that \(\neg H\) (Adam is not in computer science) is true.
- \( P(H|E) \): The probability that Adam is in computer science given his personality sketch, which we need to calculate.

**Step 2: Compute intermediate values:**

### Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
We assume there is no initial bias towards Adam being in any particular field. We'll take a generic prior for any given field, let's assume
\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]

### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
Given that Adam has good abstract reasoning, high intelligence, and enjoyment of puzzles, there's a moderate likelihood that he could be in computer science, but given his strong love for nature and animals, it decreases slightly compared to other fields closely related to nature. Let's assume
\[ P(E|H) = 0.3 \]

### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):
This is the probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he is not in computer science. Given that his traits are more aligned with a field like environmental science or biology, the likelihood of his characteristics if he is not in computer science is higher. Let's assume
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \]

**Step 3: Compute \( P(\neg H) \):**

\( P(\neg H) \) is simply the complement of \( P(H) \):
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \]

### Compute Normalizing Constant \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.6 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.48 = 0.54 \]

### Compute Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \):

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.54} \approx 0.111 \]

Let's provide the final answer in the specified format:
