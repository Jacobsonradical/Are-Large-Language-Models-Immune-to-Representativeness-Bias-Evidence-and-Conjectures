To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence against the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Given the personality sketch, let's make educated guesses for these probabilities for the field of Computer Science.

1. **Prior Probability (P(H)):**
   - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a computer science program. Graduate students in computer science programs are quite common, so let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H)):**
   - Given that Adam is in computer science, how likely is it that he has the described personality traits? People in computer science often have high intelligence, enjoy solving puzzles, and appreciate hard work and dedication but may not universally have a deep love for nature and animals. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. **Evidence Against the Hypothesis (P(E|\neg H)):**
   - To estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \), we need to consider how likely it is for people not in computer science to have the described traits. It's reasonable to suppose these traits are less common overall among people in non-technical fields, but let's conservatively estimate it as \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.24} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.32} \]

\[ P(H|E) = 0.25 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in a computer science program given his personality traits is 0.25.
