To determine \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's how we'll break it down:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science before considering the personality sketch. This can be estimated based on the popularity of the field or general knowledge about graduate programs.

2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science. This represents how well the personality traits match with a typical computer science student.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

4. \( P(E) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), which is the normalization constant.

Let's roughly estimate these probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): Suppose the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science is relatively common. We might assign this a value such as 0.15 (15%).

- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam's personality traits include high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, these are traits somewhat aligned with those often found in computer science students. However, the strong emphasis on nature, plants, and animals doesn't exactly fit the stereotypical computer science profile. We might estimate this at around 0.3 or 30%.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Considering that Adam's personality sketch might strongly align with fields like biology, environmental science, or related areas, it's likely more probable that these traits belong to someone not in computer science. We might estimate this probability higher, such as 0.7 or 70%.

Now we can calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.7 \times 0.85) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64 \]

Now apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.3 \times 0.15)}{0.64} = \frac{0.045}{0.64} \approx 0.0703 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0703 or 7.03%.
