To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to consider three probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch (E) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch (E) given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

We use these probabilities to compute **P(H|E)**, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability. Let's assume the distribution of graduate students' fields is quite diverse. If there are many fields, let’s assume computer science is a typical option but not dominant.
   - For the sake of our calculation, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (indicating 10%).

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in computer science. Adam's traits such as high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles fit well with the profile of a computer science student. Therefore, this probability should be relatively high.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \) (indicating 70%).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: This is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in any other field. While his traits are quite aligned with computer science, they are also somewhat common in many other fields of study (e.g., biology, psychology). Therefore, this probability will be substantial but not as high as \( P(E|H) \).
   - For this calculation, let's assume \( P(E|¬H) = 0.4 \) (indicating 40%).

### Applying Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.36 = 0.43 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.43} \approx \frac{0.07}{0.43} \approx 0.1628 \]
