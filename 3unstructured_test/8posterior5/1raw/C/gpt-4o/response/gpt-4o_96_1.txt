Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Judging P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H)

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. For the sake of calculation, let's assume a uniform prior where all fields of study are equally likely. If we assume there are, say, 10 different fields he could have been in, this would be 1/10. So,

   **P(H) = 0.1**

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam would have the personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science. Given that Adam is described as having a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work—traits not necessarily correlated with computer science but not excluding it either—let's assume a moderate likelihood. We'll estimate this to be:

   **P(E|H) = 0.3**

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability that Adam would have the personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science. Adam’s interests seem to align more closely with fields like biology, environmental science, or similar fields rather than computer science. Thus, this might be higher. We'll estimate this to be:

   **P(E|¬H) = 0.7**

### Step 2: Using Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where,

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.1) + (0.7 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.63 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.66 \]

Now, using Bayes' formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.045 \]

Therefore, considering the estimates used in the calculation, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately:

  "computer science": "0.045"
