Sure, let's break this down step-by-step using Bayes' Theorem. Here, we'll infer the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science (H) given his personality sketch (E).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he was enrolled in computer science.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he was not enrolled in computer science.
   
### Estimations:
1. **P(H)**: We can denote this as a proportion of graduate students in the U.S. who are in computer science. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15%), given that computer science is a popular field, but there are many other graduate programs.
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the described traits if he was in computer science. Computer science students can certainly have a wide range of interests and personalities. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).
   
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having these traits in any other field. Many fields cultivate such traits (e.g., biology, environmental science). We might assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

4. **P(\neg H)**: The probability that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
   \[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 \]

### Calculation:
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) 
    = (0.3 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) 
    = 0.045 + 0.17 
    = 0.215 
\]

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
        = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.215} 
        = \frac{0.045}{0.215}
        \approx 0.209
\]

Thus, the calculated probability is:

{
  "computer science": "0.209"
