To use Bayes' theorem for this calculation, we need to approach it as follows:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is given by:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Given that we don't have exact numerical values, we can make reasonable estimations based on the given information.

### Prior Probabilities (P(H) and P(¬H)):

1. **P(H)**: Without specific statistical data about the distribution of graduates across all fields, let's assume a prior probability \( P(H) \) that students are equally likely to be enrolled in various fields of study. For simplicity, let's say there are 10 broad fields of graduate study, so \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(¬H)**: The prior probability that Adam was not enrolled in computer science. Therefore, \( P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \).

### Likelihoods (P(E|H) and P(E|¬H)):

Given Adam's personality sketch, let's assess the likelihoods:

- **P(E|H)**: If Adam were enrolled in computer science, how likely is his personality sketch? Computer science students may not typically be associated with a deep love for nature or animals but might be consistent with solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. Let's estimate this as moderate, say \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

- **P(E|¬H)**: If Adam were not enrolled in computer science, how likely is his personality sketch? Fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology might align well with his interests. So, let's assume this is quite likely, say \( P(E|¬H) = 0.7 \).

### Posterior Probability Calculation:

Now, apply these numbers to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.63 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.66 \]

Now, finding \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0455 \]

So, our final answer is:

{
  "computer science": 0.0455
