To solve this problem, we need to estimate the probabilities involved and then apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

We need to provide estimates for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), and then compute \( P(H|E) \).

1. **P(H)** (the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science):
   - Assuming all fields of study are equally likely, let's denote an estimate. In the U.S, some fields like Computer Science are very popular among graduate students in recent years. However, there are still many other fields. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H)** (the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science):
   - Computer Science students often have high intelligence and are good at solving puzzles. However, not all have a strong curiosity about nature or a deep love for animals. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)** (the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science):
   - This probability would include other fields. Fields like biology or environmental science may better align with his curiosity about nature. More broadly, some other fields may match the personality sketch. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

4. **P(E)** (the overall probability of observing the personality sketch):
   - We can compute it using the law of total probability: \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).
   
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.36 = 0.39 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.39} \approx 0.077 \]

Thus, our estimate is:
