To apply Bayes' Rule, we need the following probabilities:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. P(E|H): The probability of observing the personality sketch E if Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. P(E|¬H): The probability of observing the personality sketch E if Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

Next, we'll make reasonable estimates for these probabilities:

1. P(H): Assume P(H) is the general probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science. Let's estimate P(H) as 0.2 (20%), considering the popularity of the field.

2. P(E|H): Given Adam's traits, such as high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, it’s plausible that he could be in computer science. However, his strong curiosity about nature and love for animals might not be as directly related to computer science. Let's estimate P(E|H) as 0.5 (50%).

3. P(E|¬H): This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he is not in computer science. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it seems more likely he could be in a field like biology or environmental science. Therefore, let's estimate P(E|¬H) as 0.7 (70%).

By applying Bayes' Rule, we get:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

First, calculate P(E):
\[ P(E) = (0.5 \times 0.2) + (0.7 \times 0.8) = 0.1 + 0.56 = 0.66 \]

Now, calculate P(H|E):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.5 \times 0.2)}{0.66} = \frac{0.1}{0.66} \approx 0.1515 \]

Therefore,
