To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to leverage Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To break this down, we need to:

1. Estimate \( P(H) \), the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in computer science.
3. Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \), the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in computer science.
4. Calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), which is a combination of \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

For simplicity, we assume the following estimates:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science (let's assume 1/6, considering 6 typical graduate fields: computer science, biology, chemistry, physics, psychology, engineering).
- \( P(E|H) \): Based on the personality sketch, Adam shows traits like high intelligence, good at abstract concepts, appreciation for hard work and curiosityâ€”all of which align moderately with computer science (let's assume 0.5).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given that the traits described are not exclusive to computer science and can fit well within other academic fields, the likelihood of \( E \) without \( H \) seems reasonably high (let's assume 0.2).

Now, calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \times \frac{1}{6}) + (0.2 \times \frac{5}{6}) \]

\[ P(E) = \frac{0.5}{6} + \frac{1}{6} \]

\[ P(E) = \frac{1.5}{6} = 0.25 \]

Now, use Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times \frac{1}{6}}{0.25} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5}{1.5} = \frac{1}{3} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \approx 0.333 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch is approximately \( 0.333 \).
