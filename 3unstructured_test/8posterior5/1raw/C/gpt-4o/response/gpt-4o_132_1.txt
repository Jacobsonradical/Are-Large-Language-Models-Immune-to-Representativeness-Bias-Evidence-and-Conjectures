Let's break down the Bayesian probability calculation step by step.

1. **P(H)** - Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Since we don't have specific data, we will assume a fairly neutral prior, say 0.2 (20%), since computer science is a commonly selected field among intelligent graduate students.

2. **P(E|H)** - Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in computer science. Given his interests in puzzles (which relate to problem-solving skills often seen in computer science) and high intelligence (necessary for abstract concepts), we can be reasonably confident in this probability. Let’s estimate it at 0.5 (50%).

3. **P(E|¬H)** - Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in computer science. Since his qualities like empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work aren't necessarily strongly associated with fields outside computer science, although they aren't exclusive to computer science either. We'll allocate a value of 0.4 (40%) for this likelihood.

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}\]

Substituting in the values:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.2)}\]
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.8}\]
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.32}\]
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.42}\]
\[P(H|E) \approx 0.238\]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.238 (23.8%).
