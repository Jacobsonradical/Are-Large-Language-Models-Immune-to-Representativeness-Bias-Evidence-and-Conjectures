To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' theorem as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was indeed enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

Since \( P(E) \) can be broken down into the probability of observing the sketch given computer science and not computer science, we use total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's assign plausible values for each of these probabilities:

### Probability Assignments:
1. **\( P(H) \)**: The probability of any random graduate student being in computer science.
   - Let's say approximately 0.2 (20%), given it's a common field among graduate students.

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - While computer science students may enjoy solving puzzles and be of high intelligence, the sketch includes strong empathy, an appreciation for nature, and a deep love for animals, which are less stereotypical for computer science students. Let's assign a value of 0.3 (30%).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
   - This will likely be higher since fields like biology, environmental science, and psychology may align better with the described attributes. Let's assign a value of 0.6 (60%).

### Calculation:
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 \]

\[ P(E) = (P(E|H) \cdot P(H)) + (P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.48 = 0.54 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.54} = \frac{1}{9} \approx 0.111 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.111.
