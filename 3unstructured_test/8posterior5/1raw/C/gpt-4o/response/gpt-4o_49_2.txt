To solve this problem using Bayes' rule, we'll need to evaluate the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science (let's say this is the base rate for computer science students among all graduate students).
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch E given that he is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch E given that he is not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch E (this is what we want to find).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Letâ€™s set approximate values for these probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science is 0.2 (20%).
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam has a personality that includes a love for nature, empathy, and solving puzzles, it's not completely in alignment with the typical computer science personality profile. However, it's not extremely unlikely either. Let's assign a probability of 0.3.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Given Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy), he might be more likely to be enrolled in fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Let's assign this a higher probability. Say, 0.7.

Now, we will calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.56 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.62 \]

Finally, we can apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.097 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.097 (9.7%).
