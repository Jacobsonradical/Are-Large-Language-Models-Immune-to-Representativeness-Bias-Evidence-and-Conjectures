First, let's break down the problem to find the probabilities needed for Bayes' Theorem. Here are some considerations for each probability:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science. While exact statistics can vary, computer science is a fairly common field. Let's assume this to be 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability that Adam exhibits the described personality traits (E) given that he is enrolled in computer science. Understanding abstract concepts and high intelligence are quite common for computer science students. However, empathy, love for nature, and animals might be less strongly associated. We'll assume this to be 0.3.

3. **P(E|Â¬H)**: The probability that Adam exhibits the described personality traits given that he is not enrolled in computer science. The described traits are fairly common and can be found in many other disciplines. We might consider this to be slightly higher than P(E|H), let's assume 0.35.

Using Bayes' Rule, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed from:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the given probabilities:

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.1) + (0.35 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.315 = 0.345 \]

Now applying Bayes Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.345} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.345} \approx 0.087 \]

Therefore, the final result is:
