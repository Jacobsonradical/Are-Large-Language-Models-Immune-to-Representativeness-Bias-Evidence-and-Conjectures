To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch (E), we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

Given this context, let's estimate these probabilities based on the information provided in the personality sketch and common knowledge about graduate studies:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: The likelihood of a student being enrolled in computer science among all graduate fields. Let's assume that the probability of any given student being in computer science is about 0.2 (a reasonable value given the popularity of the field).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were enrolled in computer science. Given that computer science students often exhibit high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, but might not typically have a strong emphasis on nature, plants, and animals, let's assign a value of 0.3.

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were not enrolled in computer science. This includes the traits of empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology might align well with these traits. Let's estimate this value at 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

Given:

- \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \)

We can calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.4 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.46 \]

Finally, using Bayes Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.13 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.13.
