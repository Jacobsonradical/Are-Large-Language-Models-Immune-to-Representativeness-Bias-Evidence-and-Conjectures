To solve this using Bayes' Theorem, we need to determine the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the likelihood of the evidence under the negation \(P(E|\neg H)\). Finally, we calculate the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\).

Here's an appraisal of the probabilities:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
    - Since we don't have a specific reason to believe Adam has higher or lower chance of being in computer science compared to other fields, we could assume an average chance. Since many graduates are likely from various fields, let's assume a prior probability:
    - Let's estimate \(P(H) = 0.1\).

2. **P(E|H):** The probability of the evidence E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
    - A high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit a computer science student well.
    - However, the strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are less relevant but not contradictory.
    - Let's estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.3\).

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of the evidence E given that Adam was NOT enrolled in computer science.
    - This could encompass a wide array of fields, notably biology or environmental science given his curiosity about nature and love for animals.
    - As there are plenty of other fields fitting his traits, we might estimate this to be higher.
    - Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.7\).

Using Bayes' Theorem \(P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\):
Where \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given \(P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\):

Calculate \(P(E)\):
\(P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.63 = 0.66\)

Calculate \(P(H|E)\):
\(P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.66} = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \approx 0.045\)

Thus:
