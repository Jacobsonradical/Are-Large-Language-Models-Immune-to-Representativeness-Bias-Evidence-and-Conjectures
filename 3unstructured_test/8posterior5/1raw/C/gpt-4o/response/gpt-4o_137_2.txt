To answer the question using Bayes' Rule, we need to determine the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

Given the general knowledge and the provided personality sketch, we can assess the probabilities. 

1. \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Let's assume that approximately 10% of graduate students in the U.S. are enrolled in computer science programs.
   - \( P(H) = 0.10 \)

2. \( P(E|H) \): This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is a computer science student. Although Adam has traits that might partially align with a computer science student (high intelligence, good at abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles), other traits like a love for nature and animals may not be as typically associated with computer science students. Let’s estimate this probability to be moderate.
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.25 \)

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not a computer science student. Since Adam’s traits could be found in a wide range of fields that also attract empathetic, nature-loving individuals with high intelligence (like biology, environmental science, etc.), we might assume this probability is relatively higher.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.75 \)

Using Bayes’ Rule to calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch, calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.25 \cdot 0.10) + (0.75 \cdot 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.70 \]

Now, we use Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.10}{0.70} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.70} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.036.
