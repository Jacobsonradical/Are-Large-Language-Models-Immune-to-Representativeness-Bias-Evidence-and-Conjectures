To efficiently apply Bayes' Rule and estimate \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis \( H \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science, we'll break it down into a few steps:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \):** This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Given that computer science is a popular field but not the majority among all graduate fields, let's assume this to be moderate.
2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in computer science. We assess how well Adam's attributes (curiosity, solving puzzles, high intelligence, abstract thinking) align with a typical computer science student.
3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is not in computer science. We consider how common Adam's attributes might be across other fields of graduate study.
4. **Compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule.**

Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \) is estimated to be 0.15 (since computer science is popular but not overwhelmingly so).
- Given Adam's traits that closely align with computer science, let's assume \( P(E|H) \) is quite high, about 0.8.
- Adam's traits are fairly common but not exclusive to computer science students, so \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be about 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Thus,
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ = 0.12 + 0.255 \]
\[ = 0.375 \]

Finally,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.375} \]
\[ = \frac{0.12}{0.375} \]
\[ = 0.32 \]

So, based on these estimates:

{
  "computer science": "0.32"
