To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is a computer science student.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not a computer science student.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits.

We will need to make educated guesses for these probabilities:

1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior for computer science):**
Let's assume around 10% of graduate students in the U.S. are in computer science programs.
\[ P(H) = 0.10 \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood given computer science):**
Adam’s traits like high intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving are good fits for computer science. His empathy and love for nature, while not typical, do not preclude him from being in computer science.
\[ P(E|H) = 0.50 \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (Likelihood given not computer science):**
Since not all fields require problem-solving skills and an appreciation for hard work, Adam’s traits might fit less well in a different field, yet it's still plausible.
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \]

4. **\( P(E) \) (Overall likelihood of observing E):**
\( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.50 \cdot 0.10) + (0.20 \cdot 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Now, apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.10}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.217 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on the given personality sketch is approximately 0.217.
