Let's analyze this step by step:

1. **Determining P(H):**
   P(H) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given that we're not initially provided with any specific data about the distribution of graduate students, let's assume the chance is fairly average across all fields. There are many fields, so for simplicity, let's assign a baseline probability. For illustration, let's say this probability is approximately 0.1 (or 10%).

2. **Determining P(E|H):**
   P(E|H) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science. The traits in the sketch include curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, a love for animals, and high intelligence. Computer science students can fit this description fairly well, especially the solving puzzles and high intelligence part. However, aspects like strong empathy and a love for animals might be less correlated with the stereotypical profile of a computer science student. Let's assign this a moderate probability, say 0.3.

3. **Determining P(E|¬H):**
   P(E|¬H) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science. Traits like curiosity about nature, empathy, and a love for animals might be more strongly associated with fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. Hence, this probability might be relatively high compared to P(E|H). Let's assign this a value of 0.6.

Finally, we use Bayes' rule to calculate P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Note that:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Now, we plug in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.54 = 0.57 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.57} = \frac{0.03}{0.57} \approx 0.0526 \]

Thus, the final probability:
