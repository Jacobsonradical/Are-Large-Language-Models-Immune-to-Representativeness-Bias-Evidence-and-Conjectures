To apply Bayes' rule to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch E, we need to estimate a few probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

We can make some educated guesses about these probabilities based on the given personality sketch and general knowledge.

### Estimations

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science can be roughly estimated based on the proportion of graduate students in computer science compared to other fields. Let's assume this to be around 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science. For computer science students, characteristics like high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are quite common. However, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature are not as strongly associated with computer science. Let’s estimate this at about 0.2 (20%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science. This personality sketch could fit well with several other fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or even some humanities. Let’s estimate this at about 0.15 (15%).

Now we can apply Bayes' rule.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.15 \cdot 0.9} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.135} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.155} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.129 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.129 (12.9%).
