Let's break down the problem to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule. 

Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the problem details:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Since no specific prior probability is given, let's assume an equal probability of Adam being enrolled in any field. Without loss of generality, we can assume \( P(H) \) is around the average for technical fields, say 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Adam's traits such as high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles align well with what is often seen in computer science students. So let's assume this value to be 0.7 (70%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science. Adamâ€™s empathy, love for nature, animals, and quiet demeanor might not be as strongly related to computer science fields but could be commonly observed in other disciplines. Assume this value to be around 0.3 (30%).

4. **P(E)**: The total probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.14 + 0.24 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.38 \]

Now applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.38} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.38} \]

\[ P(H|E) = 0.368 \]

Thus:

  "computer science": "0.368"
