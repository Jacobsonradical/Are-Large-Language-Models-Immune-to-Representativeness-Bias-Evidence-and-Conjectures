To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

However, we need to estimate these probabilities first.

### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
For simplicity, let's assume the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science is based on general statistics. Suppose roughly 20% of graduate students in the U.S. are in computer science (this is just an assumption for the sake of this problem and may vary in real-life statistics).

\[ 
P(H) = 0.2 
\]

### Probability of the Personality Sketch Given Computer Science \( P(E|H) \)
Adam's traits such as being of high intelligence, enjoying solving puzzles, and having strong understanding and appreciation for hard work align well with individuals in computer science. However, other traits like deep love for nature and animals are not typical indicators for computer science. Given this mixed alignment:

\[ 
P(E|H) \approx 0.5 
\]

### Probability of the Personality Sketch Given Not Computer Science \( P(E|\neg H) \)
For a broad category including all other fields, Adamâ€™s traits could fit into many other programs such as biology, environmental science, psychology, etc. Thus, while there is no strong reason these traits would be less likely outside computer science, they may be somewhat less aligned with general traits across all fields:

\[ 
P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 
\]

### Computing \( P(E) \)
Using the law of total probability:

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) 
\]

\[ 
P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) 
\]

\[ 
P(E) = 0.1 + 0.24 
\]

\[ 
P(E) = 0.34 
\]

### Applying Bayes' Theorem
Now we can compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.1}{0.34} 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) \approx 0.294 
\]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.294.
