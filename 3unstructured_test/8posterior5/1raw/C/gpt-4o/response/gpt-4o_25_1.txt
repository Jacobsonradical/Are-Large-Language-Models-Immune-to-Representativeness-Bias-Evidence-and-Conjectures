To compute \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here are the steps for estimating the necessary probabilities:

1. **P(H):** Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. **P(E|H):** Likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. **P(E|\neg H):** Likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

### Assumptions:

- **P(H):** The proportion of graduate students enrolled in computer science in the U.S. can be roughly estimated. Let's assume that the probability of any randomly selected graduate student being in computer science is around 0.15 (15%).
- **P(E|H):** Adam's characteristics include high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and problem-solving skills, which align well with traits beneficial in computer science. However, his strong interest in nature and plants, and empathy towards animals, might be less common in computer science. Let's estimate this as 0.4 (40%).
- **P(E|\neg H):** Adam's characteristics seem to fit more naturally with fields related to nature, biology, or environmental science. Thus, the probability of observing the personality sketch in fields other than computer science is likely higher. We can estimate this as 0.7 (70%).

### Calculation:
We use:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Plug in the assumed values:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 \)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.4 \cdot 0.15 + 0.7 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.595} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.655} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0916 \]

So, given Adam's personality sketch, the probability that he was enrolled in computer science is approximately 0.0916 (or 9.16%).

Here is the answer in the required format:
