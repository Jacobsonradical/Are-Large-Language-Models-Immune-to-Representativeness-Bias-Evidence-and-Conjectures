Sure, let's apply Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - Since we do not have specific information, we'll assume a reasonable prior probability for being a computer science student. Let's assume it is 0.2 (or 20%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - Considering Adam's traits, some of them do align with a typical computer science student's traits, like high intelligence and enjoying solving puzzles. Let's estimate this as 0.5 (50%).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
   - Given that his interests also align with many other fields like biology, psychology, or environmental science, we'll assume this is about 0.3 (30%).

4. **P(E)**: The total probability of the evidence.
   - This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|¬H)P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.8 = 0.1 + 0.24 = 0.34 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.294 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is about 0.294 or 29.4%.
