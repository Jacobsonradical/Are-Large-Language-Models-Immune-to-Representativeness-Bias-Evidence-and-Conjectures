To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), which can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that we need to estimate values between 0 and 1, we proceed as follows:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
    - Assuming a balanced likelihood across various fields for graduate students, let's arbitrate \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
    - Traits like high intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving fit well with computer science, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
    - The personality sketch could also fit other fields comfortably, letâ€™s assume this to be reasonably high, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

4. Compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.36 = 0.43 \]

5. Using Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.43} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.43} \approx 0.163 \]

Thus, the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch \( E \) is approximately 0.163.
