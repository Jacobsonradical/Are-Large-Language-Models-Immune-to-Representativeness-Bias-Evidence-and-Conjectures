To determine \( P(H), P(E|H), P(E|\neg H) \), and then compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the given personality sketch \( E \), along with a prior estimation of \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood under the negation \( P(E|\neg H) \). 

Given the field is computer science, let's assume the following values for the sake of calculation:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Since computer science is a common field among graduate students, we could assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having his personality sketch \( E \) if he were enrolled in computer science. Although computer scientists can share some of these traits, Adam's specific interest in nature and animals is less common. Let's estimate it as \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having his personality sketch \( E \) if he were not enrolled in computer science. Since his traits more closely align with fields like biology or environmental science, let's say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now, we can use Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of \( E \):

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Calculating \( P(E) \):

\[
P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26
\]

Then, calculating \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.0769
\]

So the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0769.
