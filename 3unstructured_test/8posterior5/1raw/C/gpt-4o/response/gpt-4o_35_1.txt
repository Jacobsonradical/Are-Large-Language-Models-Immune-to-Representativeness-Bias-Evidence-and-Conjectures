To compute \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch), we can use Bayes' Rule, which states:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
We need to determine the following probabilities:

1. **\( P(H) \)** = The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. **\( P(E|H) \)** = The likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)** = The likelihood of observing the personality sketch if Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
4. **\( P(E) \)** = The overall probability of the personality sketch, which can be found using the Law of Total Probability:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

### Estimating the Probabilities

1. **\( P(H) \)**: This would generally depend on the general distribution of graduate students across various fields, but let's assume a moderate prior probability for computer science, given its popularity among graduate students.
   \[
   P(H) \approx 0.2
   \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Considering that computer science students often have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, but may less likely exhibit strong empathy and a deep love for nature compared to some other fields, we can estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be moderate.
   \[
   P(E|H) \approx 0.3
   \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This includes all other fields. Since Adam's personality sketch could be very well fit to fields such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology (fields that have a direct connection to empathy, nature, and understanding abstract concepts), \( P(E|\neg H) \) could be higher.
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7
   \]

4. **\( P(E) \)**: This is calculated as follows:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) 
   \]
   Given \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \approx 0.8 \):
   \[
   P(E) \approx (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.56 = 0.62
   \]

### Applying Bayes' Rule

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.62} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.62} \approx 0.097
\]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.097.
