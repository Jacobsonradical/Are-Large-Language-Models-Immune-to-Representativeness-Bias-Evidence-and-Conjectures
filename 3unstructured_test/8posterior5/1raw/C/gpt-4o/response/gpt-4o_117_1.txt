Let's denote:

- \( H \): The hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( E \): The event representing the personality sketch of Adam.

Firstly, we need to make educated guesses for the probabilities based on the given information.

### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
The prior probability \( P(H) \) represents the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in computer science before considering the personality sketch. 

Assuming a rough estimate, the popularity of computer science fields among graduate students is high, but not dominant in the context of all possible fields. Let's assume:

\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]

### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is how likely Adam's personality sketch (a curiosity about nature and plants, solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work) is given that he is a computer science graduate student.

Although some traits could align well with a computer science student (e.g., high intelligence, puzzle-solving skills), others (e.g., deep love for nature and animals) might be less common but still plausible:

\[ P(E|H) = 0.4 \]

### Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)
The likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \) represents the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is not enrolled in computer science but in some other field.

Considering fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology might align more closely with Adam's personality due to interest in nature and empathy:

\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \]

### Computing \( P(H|E) \) via Bayes' Rule
Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of \( E \), computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Breaking this down:
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 \]

Now substituting into \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.48 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.56 \]

Finally, calculating \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{1}{7} \approx 0.1429 \]

So the probability \( P(H|E) \) is approximately \( 0.1429 \):
