To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on the given personality sketch (denoted as \( E \)), we'll use Bayesian inference. Here's the step-by-step process to compute \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science before considering the personality sketch. In the absence of specific information, we can assume a uniform prior probability. Given that computer science is a common field, let's estimate:
   \[
   P(H) = 0.2
   \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is a computer science student. Computer science students often exhibit problem-solving skills and high intelligence, and some might have an appreciation for hard work and dedication. However, curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals might be less common. Let's estimate:
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.4
   \]

3. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not a computer science student. Given the profile, Adam could belong to other fields such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology. Hence, the probability of observing such traits in students not in computer science might be slightly higher. Letâ€™s estimate:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.6
   \]

4. **Bayes' Rule**: To determine \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   Substituting the values, we get:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) = 0.08 + 0.48 = 0.56
   \]

   Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.56} = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \approx 0.143
   \]
