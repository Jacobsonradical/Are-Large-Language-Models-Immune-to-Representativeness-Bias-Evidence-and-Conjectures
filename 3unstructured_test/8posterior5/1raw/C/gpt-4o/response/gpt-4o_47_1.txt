To apply Bayes' rule and compute the probability \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood under the negation \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Given the provided context, let's analyze each component:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student in the U.S. in 2021 is enrolled in computer science. Computer science is a popular field, but not the majority of all graduate students. Let's estimate this as around 0.15 (or 15%).

2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam has the given personality sketch given that he is in computer science. Adam’s traits suggest a love for nature, empathy, animals, puzzles, and high intelligence. These traits may not be particularly specific to computer science students, but they are positively correlated with puzzle-solving and intelligence. Let’s reasonably estimate this likelihood as 0.3 (or 30%).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam has the given personality sketch given that he is *not* in computer science. Considering these traits could fit well with students in biology, environmental science, or other analytical fields, let's say this is around 0.25 (or 25%).

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \),

Given \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 \).

Calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.15 + 0.25 \cdot 0.85 = 0.045 + 0.2125 = 0.2575 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.2575} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.2575} \approx 0.1749 \]

Thus,
