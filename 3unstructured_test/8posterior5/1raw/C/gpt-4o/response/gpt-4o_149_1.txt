To estimate the values for \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E|\neg H)\) intuitively:

- \( P(H) \) : The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on general population data.
- \( P(E|H) \) : The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) : The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

We can use some deductive reasoning for these values:

1. **P(H)**
   - Let's assume that within the general population of graduate students, computer science is one of the popular fields but certainly not the most common one. We'll estimate it might be around 0.1 (10%), understanding it could understandably be higher among technical universities.
   - \( P(H) = 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H)**
   - Given Adam's attributes: high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles, as well as other attributes such as curiosity and empathetic nature, he could plausibly fit well in computer science. Let's evaluate it at 0.4 (40%).
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)**
   - If Adam wasn't enrolled in computer science, he still might fit in other fields that match his personality well (such as biology, environmental science, cognitive sciences, etc.). Let's set it to be a bit higher, say 0.6 (60%).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \)

Using Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Given:
\[ P(H) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.4 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \]

Calculate \( P(\neg H) \):
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \]

Substituting in values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{0.4 \times 0.1 + 0.6 \times 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.58} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.069 \]

So, here is the result for the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch:
