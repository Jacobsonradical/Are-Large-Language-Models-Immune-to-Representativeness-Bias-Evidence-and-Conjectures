Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Rule to calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science (CS) based on his personality sketch.

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) as the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \) as the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \) as the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch \( E \).

Now, let's estimate these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - The prior probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) could be evaluated based on the general popularity of computer science among graduate fields in the U.S. While this is a rough estimate, we might say that the prior probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) is moderately high because computer science is a common graduate field. Let's estimate \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - The likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) assesses how well the personality traits match with someone studying computer science. While a strong understanding of abstract concepts and high intelligence are strong fits, Adam's strong empathy and love for nature might be less typical for a traditional CS graduate student. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - For the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \), we need to consider how likely it is to observe Adam's traits in someone not in computer science. Given Adam's traits, he could fit well in other fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. Therefore, \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \) could be relatively high. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \).

Now, using Bayes' Rule:
\[ 
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} 
\]

Where:
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|\neg H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(\neg H_{\text{CS}}) 
\]

Calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ 
P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.08 + 0.48 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.56 
\]

Now calculate \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \):
\[ 
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.56} 
\]
\[ 
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.56} 
\]
\[ 
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = 0.142857 
\]

Expressed to two decimal places:

\[ 
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.14 \]

Thus, the answer is:

{
  "computer science": "0.14"
}
