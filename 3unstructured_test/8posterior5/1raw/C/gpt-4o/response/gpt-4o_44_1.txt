To evaluate the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality given that he was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality.

To proceed, we need to estimate these probabilities based on the information given.

1. **P(H)**: We need the prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science. This can be estimated based on the popularity of the field. Let's assume a reasonable probability, say:
   \[ P(H) = 0.1 \]
   (assuming about 10% of graduate students might be in computer science, though this might vary in reality.)

2. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's characteristics, how likely is it he was studying computer science?
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science.
   - Enjoying solving puzzles also aligns well.
   Let's assign a high probability, say:
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Given Adam's characteristics, how likely is it he was not studying computer science but another field?
   - His interest in nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals could suggest fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies.
   - We'll assign this a lower yet non-negligible probability, say:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

4. **P(E)**: The total probability of Adam having his specific set of personality traits:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

   Using the numbers:
   \[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.3 \times 0.9) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.35} = \frac{0.08}{0.35} \approx 0.229 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality traits is approximately 0.229.
