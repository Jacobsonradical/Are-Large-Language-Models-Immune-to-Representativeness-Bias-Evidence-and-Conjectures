To estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to evaluate the following terms:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

Let's go through these step by step. 

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):**
   - **Estimate**: Let's assume that approximately 20% of graduate students are enrolled in computer science. Thus, \( P(H) \approx 0.20 \).

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):**
   - **Nature and Plants**: Moderate, not specifically related to computer science.
   - **Solving Puzzles**: Very high, as this skill is quite relevant.
   - **Warm Heart, Empathy, Love for Animals**: Moderate to low relevance.
   - **High Intelligence & Abstract Concepts**: Very high relevance.

   Considering these details, we might reasonably assign a high probability, say, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.70 \).

3. **Likelihood (\( P(E|\neg H) \)):**
   - For graduate students not in computer science, the interest in nature and plants might be higher, but the puzzle-solving ability might be less relevant. Empathy and love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work are general traits that can be present in various fields.
  
   Combining these factors, let's assume a moderate probability, \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.50 \).

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is calculated as:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
P(E) = (0.70 \cdot 0.20) + (0.50 \cdot 0.80)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.14 + 0.40 = 0.54
\]

Finally, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.20}{0.54} = \frac{0.14}{0.54} \approx 0.259
\]

To represent the final answer in the required format:
{
  "computer science": "0.26"
