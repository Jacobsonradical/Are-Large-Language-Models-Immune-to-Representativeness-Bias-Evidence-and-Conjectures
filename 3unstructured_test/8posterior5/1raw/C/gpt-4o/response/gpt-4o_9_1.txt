To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to estimate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science.

**Assumptions for calculations:**
- Let’s assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) that a random graduate student in the U.S. is in computer science is 0.3 (this is reasonable given the popularity of computer science).
- \( P(E|H) \): To estimate this, let's consider the fit of Adam's characteristics with those typically associated with computer science students. Attributes such as high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, appreciation for hard work, and puzzle-solving align relatively well with computer science. However, a strong love for nature and animals doesn't specifically align but doesn't contradict either. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is harder to estimate as it encompasses all other fields. Many fields might fit Adam's profile (e.g., biology, environmental science). Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

**Bayes’ Theorem:**
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

First, calculate \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.3) + (0.4 \cdot 0.7) = 0.18 + 0.28 = 0.46
\]

Then, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.46} = \frac{0.18}{0.46} \approx 0.3913
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.3913.
