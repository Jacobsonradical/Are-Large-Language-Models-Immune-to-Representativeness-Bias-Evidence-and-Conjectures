To address this problem, we need to estimate the probabilities and then apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's a rough estimation based on the information provided:

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science:**
   - Since this can be quite subjective, let's assume a general distribution of graduate students across various fields. For simplicity, let's say there's a modesty high probability, given the popularity of computer science.

   P(H) ≈  0.2

2. **P(E|H) - Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was enrolled in computer science:**
   - Adam is empathetic, loves nature and animals, and enjoys solving puzzles. Empathy and love for nature are less characteristic of a computer science student but liking to solve puzzles aligns well with computer science.
   - Thus, the personality sketch partly matches.

   P(E|H) ≈ 0.3
   
3. **P(E|¬H) - Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was not enrolled in computer science:**
   - If not in computer science, Adam could equally likely be in a range of other fields where such personality traits might also fit fairly well (perhaps biology, environmental science, etc.).
   - Given Adam's interests in nature, academia in a field like biology might have a higher fit.

   P(E|¬H) ≈ 0.25

Now apply Bayes' rule to find P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:  
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H) \]

First calculate P(E):

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.25 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Now compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ \frac{0.06}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.23 \]

Thus, our estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is around 0.23. Therefore, the approximate result is:
