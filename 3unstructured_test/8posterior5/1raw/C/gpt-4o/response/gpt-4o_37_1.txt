To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to assess the provided probabilities:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given that Adam was a graduate student, the prior probability could be a general estimation of how likely graduate students major in computer science. Let's assume P(H) = 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H):** The likelihood of observing the personality traits described (E) given that Adam was in computer science. Considering that computer science students can be very diverse but often share traits like high intelligence and an interest in solving puzzles, we might assign this a moderately high probability. Let's say P(E|H) = 0.6.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** The likelihood of observing the personality traits described (E) given that Adam was not in computer science. Since Adam's traits are quite general and can apply to many fields, we can consider this high as well. Let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.5.

Now, we can use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

So,

\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.2) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.4 = 0.52 \]

Now,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.52} = \frac{0.12}{0.52} \approx 0.2308 \]

Putting this into the required format:

{
  "computer science": "0.2308"
