To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam shows the observed traits given that he was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam shows the observed traits given that he was not enrolled in computer science.

Bayes' theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given the abstract and empathetic nature of Adam, his interest in nature, animals, and solving puzzles, let's reason about these probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The likelihood that any given graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume for context that 1 in 8 students at graduate level are in computer science, so \( P(H) = 0.125 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability that a computer science student has the described personality traits. While some traits like high intelligence and being good at solving puzzles might fit, others like a deep love for animals and nature might be less common. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that a non-computer science graduate student has these personality traits, given fields like biology or environmental science might be a good fit. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \).

Now, calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.125) + (0.4 \times 0.875) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.025 + 0.35 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.375 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.125}{0.375} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.375} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.067 \]

So the probability that Adam is a computer science student given his personality traits is approximately 0.067, or 6.7%.
