Sure, let's denote our probabilities to compute \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a breakdown of each component:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of Adam's personality sketch, which can be calculated using the law of total probability.

Assume the following reasonable approximations:
- Considering the popularity of computer science among graduate students, \( P(H) \) might be around 0.2.
- Given the personality traits (love for nature, animals, empathy), it seems less typical for a computer science student, so \( P(E|H) \) might be lower, around 0.1.
- On the contrary, given the same personality traits, these might be more typical for fields like biology or psychology, leading \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be around 0.6.

Now let's calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.48 = 0.50 \]

Finally, using Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.04 \]

Thus:
