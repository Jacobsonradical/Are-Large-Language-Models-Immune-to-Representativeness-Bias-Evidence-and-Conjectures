To calculate the probability that Adam was studying computer science (\(H\)) given his personality sketch (\(E\)), we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was studying computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the personality traits given that he is studying computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having the personality traits given that he is not studying computer science.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam having the personality traits, which can be calculated by:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's assign reasonable values to these probabilities:
1. **\( P(H) \) (prior probability)**: Let's assume the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is studying computer science is 0.2 (20%).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that Adam has the given personality traits if he is studying computer science. Typically, computer science students can be highly intelligent and good at solving puzzles, but the specific interest in nature, plants, and empathy might be less aligned. Let's assign this a probability of 0.4.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability that Adam has the given personality traits if he is not studying computer science. Since these traits might be common or even more likely in fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, let's assign this a probability of 0.6.

4. **\( P(\neg H) \)**: The probability that Adam is not studying computer science, which is 1 - \( P(H) \) = 0.8.

Now we can calculate \(P(E)\):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.48 = 0.56 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to calculate \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.56} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.143 \]

So the probability that Adam was studying computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.143, or 14.3%.
