Sure, I'll provide an estimate for the probability values and use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

1. **\( P(H) \)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Let's assume \( P(H) \) is the general proportion of graduate students in computer science. This could be estimated at around 0.20 (since computer science is a popular field, but by no means the majority).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing E (Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given Adam's traits, there is a moderate chance he could be in computer science, especially considering his high intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles. Let's estimate this at 0.30.

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing E given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science. Adamâ€™s personality traits are quite general and could fit students in many fields, such as biology, psychology, or environmental science. Let's estimate this at 0.70.

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \) first:

\[ P(E) = (0.30 \cdot 0.20) + (0.70 \cdot 0.80) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.56 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.62 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.097 \]

So, the probability that Adam was a graduate student in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.097.
