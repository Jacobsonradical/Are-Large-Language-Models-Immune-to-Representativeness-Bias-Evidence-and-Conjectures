To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood (the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in computer science).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch.

First, we need to make some reasonable guesses for these probabilities:
- \( P(H) \) (Adam is enrolled in computer science): Let's assume this to be the prior probability of a graduate student being in this field. In many universities, computer science is a popular field, but given the wide array of fields available, we might estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

- \( P(E|H) \) (Probability of the personality sketch given Adam is in CS):
  - High intelligence fits well (\( P(E|H)\approx 0.9 \)).
  - Genuine curiosity, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts also fit well with many CS students.
  - While empathy and a deep love for animals aren't particularly typical traits sought in CS specifically, they don't conflict with the personality.
  Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \) after considering all these factors.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not in CS):
  - Given that many of these traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work) could fit various fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, etc., we might estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \).

The base rate \( P(E) \) is computed based on the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.36 = 0.42 \]

Finally, we compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.143 \]
