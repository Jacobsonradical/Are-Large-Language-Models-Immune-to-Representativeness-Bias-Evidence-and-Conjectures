To make a reasonable assessment of the conditional probabilities, we'll consider the typical characteristics and requirements of a graduate student in computer science and how well Adam’s personality and interests align with them.

Let's denote:
- P(H) as the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- P(E|H) as the probability of Adam's personality sketch E given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- P(E|\neg H) as the probability of Adam's personality sketch E given that he was not enrolled in computer science.
- P(H|E) as the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch E.

For simplicity, let's assume the following values:
- P(H) (the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science) = 0.2. This is based on an assumption that there are several fields he could be enrolled in, with computer science being one of them.

- P(E|H) (the likelihood of seeing Adam’s characteristics if he were in computer science) = 0.3. This is because while some characteristics of Adam, like high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, align well with computer science, other interests such as a strong empathy, deep love for animals, and fascination with nature might suggest different fields.

- P(E|\neg H) (the likelihood of seeing Adam’s characteristics if he were not in computer science) = 0.7. This might be higher, reflecting that Adam’s unique blend of characteristics might be more common outside of a technical and typically more abstract field like computer science.

Now, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.56 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.62 \]

Now, let's compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.097 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.097.
