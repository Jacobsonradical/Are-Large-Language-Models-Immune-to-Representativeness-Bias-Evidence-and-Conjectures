To determine \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in computer science, we need to evaluate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \), and then apply Bayes' rule. 

Let's make some reasonable assumptions based on the information provided:

1. \( P(H) \) represents our prior belief about the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \) represents the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) represents the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was not enrolled in computer science.

Given Adam's described personality traits, let's consider the relevance of computer science to each characteristic:

- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are typical traits of someone who might excel in computer science.
- His curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are less directly related to computer science, and might suggest a leaning towards fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology.

Based on these points, let's estimate the probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): Assuming computer science is one of many possible fields Adam could be enrolled in, let's estimate a prior of 0.1 (10%).
  
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that computer science students often require high intelligence and abstract thinking, but less so for other traits described, let's estimate this at 0.3 (30%).

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Many other fields could be suitable for Adam's overall personality sketch, including biology or environmental sciences. We might estimate this as larger, say 0.7 (70%).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.03 + 0.63 = 0.66
\]

Applying the values to Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.66} = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \approx 0.045
\]

Thus,

\[
{
  "computer science": "0.045"
}
\]
