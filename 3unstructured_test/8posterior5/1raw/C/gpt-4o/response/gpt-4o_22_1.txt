Let's use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate these probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is studying computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is studying computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is not studying computer science.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's personality traits.

### Estimations

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Given many students enroll in computer science programs, let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.20 \) (this is a rough estimation).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Computer science students might have some personality traits like high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles.
   - However, the strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication might be less common.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   - These traits can also be found in students of other fields such as biology, environmental science, or even humanities.
   - Let's estimate this likelihood as \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 \).

4. **Overall Probability \( P(E) \)**
   - \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \)
   - \( P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.20) + (0.5 \times 0.80) = 0.06 + 0.40 = 0.46 \)

### Calculation

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.20}{0.46} \approx 0.130 \]
