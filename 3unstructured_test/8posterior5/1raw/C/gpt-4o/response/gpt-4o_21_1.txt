To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to define each probability term clearly and provide reasonable estimates (since exact values are not given):

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \(E\) (Adam's personality sketch) given that he was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \(E\) given that he was not enrolled in computer science.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the evidence \(E\).

### Step-by-Step Calculation

**1. Determine \( P(H) \):**
Since we donâ€™t have specific data, we can assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) that a graduate student was in computer science. If we assume equal probability among various common fields, we'd estimate around 0.1 (10%).

\( P(H) = 0.1 \)

**2. Determine \( P(E|H) \):**
Computer science students can have varied interests, but a high intelligence, curiosity about nature (possibly linked to algorithms, data structures, or artificial intelligence), empathy, and problem-solving skills could be reasonably associated with them. Let's estimate this as 0.5.

\( P(E|H) = 0.5 \)

**3. Determine \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
This is the probability of the evidence given that Adam is not in computer science. Considering other fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, which may align more closely with his personality sketch, \( P(E|\neg H) \) could be higher, let's say 0.7.

\( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \)

**4. Compute \( P(H|E) \):**
Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Calculations:
\[ P(E) = (0.5 \times 0.1) + (0.7 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 + 0.63 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.68 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.1}{0.68} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.05}{0.68} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0735 \]

Rounding off for notation convention:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.07 \]
