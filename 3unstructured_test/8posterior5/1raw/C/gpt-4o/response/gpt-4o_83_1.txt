To provide an answer using Bayes' rule, we'll need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - The likelihood that Adam has the described personality if he was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - The likelihood that Adam has the described personality if he was not enrolled in computer science.

Given:
\(P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\)

For computational purposes:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's make some reasonable estimates for these probabilities based on the information provided:

1. \( P(H) \): 
We start by estimating the prior probability. Computer science is a common field, but not the most common. Let's estimate around 0.2 (or 20%).

2. \( P(E|H) \):
Given that people in computer science might have varied personalities, it's reasonable that a subset like Adam might exist. But considering Adam's specific traits aligning with biology or environmental sciences more, we'll estimate it at 0.3 (or 30%).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \):
Adam's characteristics highly align with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. We can estimate this probability to be relatively higher, perhaps around 0.7 (or 70%).

Now use these estimates to compute:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ = 0.06 + 0.56 \]
\[ = 0.62 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.62} \]
\[ = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \]
\[ \approx 0.097 \]

Therefore, based on our estimates and Bayes' rule, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.097 (or 9.7%).
