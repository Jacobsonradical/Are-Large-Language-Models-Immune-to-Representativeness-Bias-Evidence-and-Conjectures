To answer the question in the requested format, we first need to make reasonable estimations for the probabilities given the information available:

1. **P(H)** - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. **P(E|H)** - The probability of Adam's personality sketch (E) given that he was enrolled in computer science.
3. **P(E|\neg H)** - The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume the baseline probability that a graduate student chooses computer science as their field. Though this can vary, let's assume a moderate estimate since computer science is a popular field. Suppose P(H) = 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: We need to consider how likely Adam's personality traits are if he were a computer science student. Curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work are not typical standouts for this field, but it's not impossible. Thus, let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This reflects the probability of Adam's personality sketch if he were not in computer science. Since his traits suggest a more naturalistic or empathetic inclination (possibly towards biology, environmental science, or similar fields), let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.3.

### Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.077 \]

After following this analysis, we would get:

  "computer science": 0.077
