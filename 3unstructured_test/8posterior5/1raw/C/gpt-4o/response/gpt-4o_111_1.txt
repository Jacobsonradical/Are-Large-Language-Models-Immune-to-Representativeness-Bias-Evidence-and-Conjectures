To solve this problem, we'll start by estimating the probabilities relevant to Bayes' theorem. Specifically, we'll calculate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch of Adam if he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch of Adam if he was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch, which can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we need plausible estimates for these probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Let's assume that in the general population of graduate students in the U.S., approximately 10% are enrolled in computer science.
  \[
  P(H) \approx 0.1
  \]

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch if he was enrolled in computer science. Given his description as being highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which are traits often associated with computer science students, we can reasonably assume this is moderately high.
  \[
  P(E|H) \approx 0.6
  \]

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch if he was not enrolled in computer science. His interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy is not particularly aligned with the stereotypes of computer science students. This probability might be lower.
  \[
  P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.2
  \]

- \( P(\neg H) \): The probability that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
  \[
  P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9
  \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.06 + 0.18
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.24
\]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.24}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.24}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = 0.25
\]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is estimated to be 0.25.

Thus, our answer is:

{
  "computer science": "0.25"
}
