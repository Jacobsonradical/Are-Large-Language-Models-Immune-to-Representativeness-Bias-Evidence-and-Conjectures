Given the provided personality sketch and using Bayes' rule to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was a computer science student. Since this isn't specified directly, we'll assume a broad prior based on common enrollment statistics. In the context of graduate programs, let's assume a balanced prior, estimating P(H) as 0.3.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the personality traits described in E if he were a computer science student. While some traits (like being highly intelligent, understanding abstract concepts, enjoying solving puzzles) fit well with computer science, others (like a deep love for animals, strong empathy) may be less directly related. Let's estimate P(E|H) as 0.5.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam having the personality traits described in E if he were not a computer science student. These traits can fit many other fields besides computer science, possibly at a similar rate. Let's estimate P(E|¬H) as 0.6.

Now, using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.5 \cdot 0.3 + 0.6 \cdot 0.7} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.42} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.57} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.263 \]

Given this calculation, we find the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science to be approximately 0.263.
