Sure, let's break this down using Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's define the probabilities:
- P(H) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- P(E|¬H) is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch E.

To make these estimates, we need to consider Adam's personality traits:

1. **P(H):** Computer science has a high proportion of individuals who are intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which fits Adam's description. However, we may need to factor in that Adam has a particular interest in nature, plants, and animals, which is not as common in computer science. Let's estimate P(H) at 0.2, considering these aspects.

2. **P(E|H):** Given that someone is in computer science, they might still have a genuine curiosity about nature and empathy towards animals, although these traits are not typically associated with the majority of students in this field. Nevertheless, the traits of high intelligence and liking for puzzles fit well. Considering this, let's estimate P(E|H) at 0.4.

3. **P(E|¬H):** For fields that are not computer science, Adam's traits might be more common in biological sciences, environmental studies, or psychology, for instance. These fields might be more aligned with his interests in nature and animals. As such, the probability of E given ¬H might be higher. Let's estimate P(E|¬H) at 0.7.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.56} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.64} \]

\[ P(H|E) = 0.125 \]

Therefore:
