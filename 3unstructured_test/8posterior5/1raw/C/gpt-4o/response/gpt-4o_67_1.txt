Let's tackle this step-by-step using the given information and Bayesian inference.

### Step-by-Step Bayesian Reasoning

1. **P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.**
   - We lack specific information about Adam's likelihood of being in any particular field, so we may assume a uniform prior across different fields, making P(H) relatively low.
   - Assume: \( P(H) = 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H): The probability that Adam's personality sketch E matches given he is in computer science.**
   - Computer science students can have a variety of personalities, but quiet individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and have high intelligence align reasonably well.
   - Assume: \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H): The probability that Adam's personality sketch E matches given he is *not* in computer science.**
   - Adam's characteristics such as a love for nature, plants, and animals might make him more likely to be in a field related to biology, environmental science, or a similar field.
   - Assume: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \)

4. **Using Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

   Where \( P(E) \) is calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]

   \(\neg H\) is the event of Adam not being in computer science:
   \[
   P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.9) = 0.06 + 0.27 = 0.33
   \]

   Now, we can compute \( P(H|E) \):
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.33} = \frac{0.06}{0.33} \approx 0.1818
   \]

So, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is approximately 0.1818.
