To use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \), which in this case, we'll compute using \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

For Adam, the given personality traits and interests need to be mapped to a field of study. Evaluating the field of Computer Science with respect to Adam's traits:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the probability of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science without any additional information. Let’s assume that in 2021, among all possible fields a graduate student might enroll in, the probability of being in Computer Science is roughly 0.15 (15%). This is a rough estimate and could technically vary depending on more precise statistical data.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's traits given that he is enrolled in Computer Science. Given that Adam shows an interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and good understanding of abstract concepts, these traits align well with those often found in Computer Science students. Additionally, a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits. Let's estimate this probability as 0.8 (80%).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's traits given that he is not enrolled in Computer Science. Adam’s traits like a genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals can be associated with a variety of other fields such as Biology, Environmental Science, or Psychology. Given the broad applicability of these traits, let's set \( P(E|\neg H) \) to 0.4 (40%).

Using Bayes' Rule \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), we can compute the posterior probability.

First, we need to compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.34 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.46 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.46} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.46} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2609 \]

So, the computed probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.2609 or 26.09%.
