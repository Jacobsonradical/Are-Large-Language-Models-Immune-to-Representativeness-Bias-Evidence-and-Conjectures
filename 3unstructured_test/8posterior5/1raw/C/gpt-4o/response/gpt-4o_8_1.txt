To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to estimate the probabilities:

1. **\( P(H) \) (The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science)**
   - Suppose the probability of any given graduate student being in computer science is moderately high. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (20%).

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is in computer science)**
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, warm heart, empathy, and love for animals may not strongly correlate with typical characteristics of computer science students. However, his love for puzzles, intelligence, and abstract thinking do align well with computer science attributes. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \) (40%).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not in computer science)**
   - Students in other fields, especially biology, environmental science, or psychology, might align well with Adam's personality sketch. This probability could be relatively high. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \) (60%).

4. **\( P(E) \) (The overall probability of observing the personality sketch E)**
   - This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   
   Using our assumptions:
   
   \[
   P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.6 \times 0.8) = 0.08 + 0.48 = 0.56
   \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.56} = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \approx 0.143 
\]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately \( 0.143 \).
