Sure, let's denote the fields and work through the problem as outlined. We can use Bayes' Theorem, \(P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}\).

Here's the structured calculation:

1. **Prior probability** \( P(H) \): The likelihood that Adam, a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, is in a computer science program. Without specific data, we'd assume a general likelihood given the popularity of computer science. Let’s estimate this as 0.3.

2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the description of Adam fitting if he is enrolled in computer science. Computer science students can be curious about the structure and puzzles; significance of understanding abstract concepts fits the profile well. However, it doesn't touch on nature, plants, or animals much. We might estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.4.

3. **Complement likelihood** \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the description fitting Adam if he is not in computer science. Considering several fields could match his profile, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology, let’s estimate this as 0.3.

4. **Normalizing constant** \( P(E) \): This can be derived from summing the weighted averages of \( P(E|H)P(H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H)(1-P(H)) \).

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)(1 - P(H)) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.3) + (0.3 \times 0.7) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.21 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.33 \]

5. **Posterior probability** \( P(H|E) \): Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{0.33} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.33} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.36 \]

So, the probability that Adam is in the computer science field given his personality sketch is approximately 0.36.
