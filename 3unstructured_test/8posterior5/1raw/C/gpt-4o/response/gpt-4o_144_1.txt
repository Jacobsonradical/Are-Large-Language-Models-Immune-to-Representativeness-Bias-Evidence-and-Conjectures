Firstly, we need to gauge the relevant probability values and then use Bayes' Rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

Let's consider each component in the context of Adam's personality sketch:

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
2. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
3. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given this information:

- \( P(H) \): Computer science is a common field for graduate studies, but not overwhelmingly so compared to other fields. We might estimate this probability to be around 0.1 (10% for any given individual).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam is in computer science, there might be a smaller correlation with nature and plants, but a stronger alignment with solving puzzles, intelligence, and abstract concepts. Let's estimate this as moderate, around 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This will take into account the likelihood of E given that Adam is in any field other than computer science. Fields tied closely to nature (like biology, environmental science) might be more likely. Given these factors, this could be higher, say around 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.5 \cdot 0.9 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.45 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.48 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.48} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.48} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0625 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0625.
