To determine the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to analyze P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|\neg H), and then apply Bayes' rule. We will denote the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as P(H).

Let's break it down:
- P(H): The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- P(E|\neg H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science.
- P(E): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

### Assigning Probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: This reflects the base rate of graduate students enrolling in computer science. Let's assume a reasonable estimation:
   \[
   P(H) \approx 0.2
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam was enrolled in computer science, we'd evaluate how likely his characteristics fit with this field. While deep love for nature and animals isn't strongly aligned with computer science, high intelligence and appreciation for hard work are. Also, problem-solving skills are relevant. Therefore:
   \[
   P(E|H) \approx 0.5
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's traits given that he was enrolled in a different field. Adam's interests in nature and animals might align better with fields like biology or environmental science, but high intelligence and problem-solving skills are quite general. Therefore, these traits can also be common in other disciplines:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3
   \]

### Applying Bayes' Rule:
Bayes' theorem states:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

First, we need to use the law of total probability to find P(E):
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Since \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \):
\[
P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.1 + 0.24 = 0.34
\]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.34} \approx \frac{0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.294
\]

Thus, the computed probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.294.
