To apply Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science (H) given his personality sketch (E), we'll follow this step-by-step process:

1. **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Without specific population data, let's assume a generic prior, for instance, considering many graduate students choose computer science, but not overwhelmingly so. Let's hypothetically set P(H) = 0.2.

2. **P(E|H):** This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science. Computer science students can certainly have a high level of intelligence and abstract thinking, but his strong empathy, love for nature, and animals might be less typical. Therefore, let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.3.

3. **P(E|\neg H):** This is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science. Since Adam's traits may align well with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, let's estimate P(E|\neg H) = 0.5.

4. **P(\neg H):** This is the prior probability that Adam was not enrolled in computer science. If P(H) = 0.2, then P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8.

Now, we can use Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

So, plugging in the values:
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.4 = 0.46 \]

Finally,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.46} \approx 0.13 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.13.
