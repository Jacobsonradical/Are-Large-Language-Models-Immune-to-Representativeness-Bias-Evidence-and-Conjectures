To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to assess the likelihoods, prior probability, and evidence. Here is the step-by-step calculation:

Given:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing personality traits E given that Adam is in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of observing personality traits E given that Adam is not in computer science.

We aim to determine:
- \( P(H|E) \): Posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality traits E.

Bayes' Rule is defined as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

**Step 1: Assess the prior probability \( P(H) \):**  
Assuming that Adam, as a graduate student in the U.S., has an equal chance of being enrolled in various fields, we might assume a prior probability \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (assuming 10 different possible fields of study for simplicity).

**Step 2: Assess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**  
Given E involves traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and being good at abstract concepts, we estimate these traits somewhat likely for a computer science student, but not perfectly. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

**Step 3: Assess the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**  
Now, we need to estimate the probability of observing these traits in someone who is not a computer science student. Given Adam's love for the natural world and animals, he might be more likely found in fields like biology, ecology, or environmental science rather than computer science. So let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

**Step 4: Compute the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \):**  
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.63 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.66 \]

**Step 5: Apply Bayes' Rule:**  
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.045 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality traits is approximately 0.045.
