To evaluate the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on the given personality sketch, we will use Bayesian inference.

Given information:
- Let \( E \) denote the personality sketch of Adam.
- Let \( H \) denote the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

We need to evaluate the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \) - Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \) - Probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam was in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - Probability of observing the personality sketch given Adam was not in computer science.

Based on the personality sketch:
- Adam is curious about nature and loves animals (traits that might be less common in a typical computer science student).
- Adam solves puzzles and understands abstract concepts well (traits that align with computer science).
- High intelligence (neutral, could fit many fields including computer science).
- Warm heart and strong empathy (not directly related to computer science but doesn't exclude it).

Let's estimate the probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science might be around 0.1 (10%), assuming a distribution among various common graduate fields.

2. \( P(E|H) \) - the probability of the personality sketch given Adam is in computer science should consider that the puzzle-solving and abstract thinking skills are highly related, but the interest in nature and animals is less typical. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) - this is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in computer science, which might be higher due to the nature and animal interests being more common in other fields such as biology or environmental science. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \).

Now, we can compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch. Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.54 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.58 \]

Then, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.58} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.58} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.069 \]
