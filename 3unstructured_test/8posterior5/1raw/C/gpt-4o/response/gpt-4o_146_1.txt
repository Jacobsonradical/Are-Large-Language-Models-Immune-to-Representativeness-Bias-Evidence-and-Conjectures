Alright, let's calculate the values step by step.

1. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Generally, many fields of study exist, but I'll assume a non-biased distribution among them. Let's estimate P(H) to be around 1/10, since there could be roughly 10 popular fields of study for graduate students.

2. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch matches someone in the computer science field. People in computer science can have varied personalities, but Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and problem-solving skills align well with a typical computer science profile. I'll estimate this probability to be relatively high, say 0.6.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch matches someone not in computer science. Given that Adam's personality traits are quite general and can apply to many fields like biology, psychology, or environmental science, I'll estimate this value to be moderately high, say 0.4.

We now apply Bayesâ€™ Rule to find P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.1) + (0.4 \times 0.9) = 0.06 + 0.36 = 0.42 \]

Then,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.6) \cdot (0.1)}{0.42} = \frac{0.06}{0.42} = \frac{6}{42} = 0.142857 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.143.
