To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch), we need to assess the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The initial (prior) probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

Assumptions and Estimates:
- \( P(H) \): Let’s assume the prior probability that Adam was a computer science student is moderate. This field has a good number of graduate students in the U.S., so let’s estimate this prior probability as 0.2 (20%).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were in computer science could be somewhat moderate to high. Computer science students often have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, but they might not be typically characterized by a strong empathy and love for nature. Let's say 0.4 (40%).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not in computer science. Given Adam’s personality traits, these might be more common in fields related to biology, psychology, or environmental sciences. Let’s estimate this probability as 0.6 (60%).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.6 \times 0.8) = 0.08 + 0.48 = 0.56 \]

Now compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.56} = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \approx 0.143 \]

Thus,
