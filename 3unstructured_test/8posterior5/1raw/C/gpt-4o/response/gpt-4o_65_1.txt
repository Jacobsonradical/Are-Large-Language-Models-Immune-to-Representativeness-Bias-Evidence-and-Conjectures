To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, we can use Bayesian inference. The relevant formula for Bayes' Rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of Adam's personality sketch.

Here's how we can evaluate these terms:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - This is the base rate for computer science students among graduate students in the U.S. Without specific data, we'll assume this to be a reasonable estimate.
   
   For example, we could assume a prior around \( 0.1 \) (10%), given that computer science is a popular field but not the majority.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The likelihood that Adam, given he was in computer science, would have the described personality traits.
   
   Suppose his curiosity about nature and various plants is less common among computer science students, but his intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit well.

   We could estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - The likelihood that Adam would have the described personality traits if he were not enrolled in computer science.
   
   Given his love for nature and animals, these traits might be more common in fields like biology or environmental science.

   We could estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

4. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is computed using the law of total probability:
   
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

   Using our estimates:
   \[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.45 = 0.48 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.48} \approx 0.0625
\]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately \( 0.0625 \).
