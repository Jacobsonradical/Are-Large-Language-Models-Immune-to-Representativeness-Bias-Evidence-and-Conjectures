To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch E, we need to evaluate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

Then, we can use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

Let's estimate these probabilities using the information provided:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student was enrolled in computer science. Computer science is a common field of study, but several other fields are equally competitive. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.1 (or 10%).

2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was in computer science. The sketch describes a boy who is curious about nature and enjoys puzzles, which could align with computer science interests (e.g., problem-solving skills). However, his deep love for nature and animals might be less typical. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.2.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not in computer science. Fields like biology, environmental science, or cognitive science might be more aligned with his personality. Given the broader range of options that fit his personality outside computer science, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.4.

Now we can use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's first calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.36 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.38 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0526 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0526.
