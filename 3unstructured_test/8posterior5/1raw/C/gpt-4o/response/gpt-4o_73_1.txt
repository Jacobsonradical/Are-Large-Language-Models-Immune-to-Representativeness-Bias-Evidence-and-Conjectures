To apply Bayes' rule for computing \( P(H|E) \), we use the following formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Let's estimate these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the probability that a random graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume computer science is a popular field among graduate students, but not overly dominant. So, we might estimate:
   \[ P(H) = 0.2 \]

2. **Probability \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science.
   - Since Adam's personality traits like high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are common in computer science, but his love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles may not be as strongly associated with computer science, let’s give a reasonable estimate of:
   \[ P(E|H) = 0.3 \]

3. **Probability \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in computer science.
   - Considering that these traits might be just as likely in a variety of other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science, etc.), we can estimate:
   \[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \]

4. **Overall Probability \( P(E) \)**: This represents how common Adam's personality sketch is among all graduate students. Given the estimates for \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), and combining with the prior probability \( P(H) \):
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot (1 - 0.2)) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.24 \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.3 \]

Now, applying Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.3} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.2 \]

So our final answer is:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
