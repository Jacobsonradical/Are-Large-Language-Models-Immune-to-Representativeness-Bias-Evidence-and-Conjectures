To apply Bayes' rule to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to assign values to the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's break it down:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was *not* enrolled in computer science.

Finally, we will use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Given the personality sketch, we can infer that:

- Adam's qualities (e.g., curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) might not strongly align with the stereotypical traits of someone studying computer science.
- However, his intelligence and problem-solving abilities could be qualities that would suit a computer science field.

Firstly, let's assign reasonable probability estimates:

### Assigning Probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: Probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Let's assume that the base rate for computer science graduate students in the U.S. is around 10% (or 0.1).

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science. Considering his quiet nature, intelligence, and problem-solving abilities, but lack of direct alignment with nature and animals, we might estimate this to be relatively low, say 0.2.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science. Considering broader fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, etc., might fit better with his interests. We might estimate this higher, say 0.7.

4. **P(\neg H)**: Probability that Adam was not enrolled in computer science (this is simply \( 1 - P(H) \)). So, \( P(\neg H) = 0.9 \).

### Computation:

Now we can compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.63 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.65 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.65} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.65} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0308 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.0308.
