To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define the terms explicitly:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- P(E|H): The probability of the observed evidence given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of the observed evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
- P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the evidence.

Bayes' theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To compute \(P(H|E)\), we first need to estimate P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H).

1. **P(H):** 
   - Without additional context, let's assume equally likely enrollment in any graduate field. If there are many fields, say 10 sectors, we could initially assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

2. **P(E|H):** 
   - If Adam were in computer science, how probable is his personality sketch? Computer science students often engage in problem-solving and abstract thinking, but aspects like empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants might be less common or unrelated. So, we could estimate this to be moderate. Let's put this at \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).

3. **P(E|¬H):**
   - If Adam was not enrolled in computer science, how probable is his personality sketch? Considering empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, it might better fit a field like biology or environmental science. So, the probability might be relatively higher. Let's estimate this at \( P(E|¬H) \approx 0.7 \).

Now we need to calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability of the evidence E:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

\[ = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) \]

\[ = 0.03 + 0.63 \]

\[ = 0.66 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.66} \]

\[ \approx \frac{0.03}{0.66} \]

\[ = \frac{3}{66} \]

\[ \approx 0.045 \]

So,
