To evaluate the probabilities and use Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on his personality sketch, let's assign values to the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.

Assumptions and reasoning:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Let's assume a baseline prior for any single field among various fields a graduate student might choose. For simplicity, if we treat the likelihood of selecting any one field out of many popular ones (say 10), \( P(H) \) might be roughly \( \frac{1}{10} \).

   \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Considering Adam's traits such as high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts, these are reasonably aligned with what is often required for computer science. However, his strong inclination towards nature, plants, and animals is less typical of traditional computer science students but not impossible. Let's assign a moderate likelihood for this.

   \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   The likelihood of this personality sketch given that Adam was in a different field could be higher in fields like biology, environmental science, or zoology due to his love for nature and animals. For other fields, the likelihood may vary. Overall, it's very likely that he fits better in non-computer science fields given his personality traits.

   \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \) (As his profile fits more closely with those non-CS fields)

Now, we apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Where \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \).

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.3 \times 0.1 + 0.7 \times 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.63} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.045 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality and interests is around 0.045 or 4.5%.
