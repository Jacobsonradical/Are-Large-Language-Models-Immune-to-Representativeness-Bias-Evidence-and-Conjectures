Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
   - Since we do not have specific data on Adam's likelihood of being in computer science before considering his personality, we could use a general estimate based on common graduate programs. Let’s assume a reasonable estimate is 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam possessing his described personality traits given that he is enrolled in computer science.
   - Given the emphasis on curiosity about nature, warmth, empathy, and love for animals, these traits are not particularly common in stereotypical computer science students but not impossible either. Let’s assume a reasonably low value, say 0.1 (10%).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam possessing his described personality traits given that he is not enrolled in computer science.
   - These traits might be more common in fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Let's assume this likelihood is higher, say 0.8 (80%).

4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of Adam possessing his described personality traits. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.8 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.64 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.66 \]

5. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science given his personality traits. This can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.0303 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science given his personality traits is approximately 0.03, or 3%.
