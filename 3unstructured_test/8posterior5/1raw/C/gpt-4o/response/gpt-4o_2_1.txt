To calculate \(P(H|E)\) for the field of computer science using Bayes' rule, let's denote the following probabilities:

- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
- \(P(\neg H)\): The prior probability that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

1. **Estimate \(P(H)\)**: Computer science is a common field for graduate students, especially given the high demand for technology-related expertise. Let's assume a baseline probability for this example.

   \(P(H) = 0.2\) (an estimate as about 20% of graduate students might be in computer science).

2. **Estimate \(P(E|H)**: Considering Adam's personality sketch, there are certain characteristics that align with a computer science student (e.g., high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles). However, other traits (e.g., strong empathy, deep love for animals) are less typical for the stereotype of a computer science student but not completely out of place.

   \(P(E|H) = 0.4\) (Adam's characteristics moderately match those of a computer science student).

3. **Estimate \(P(E|\neg H)\)**: For students not enrolled in computer science, Adamâ€™s characteristics are quite common in many other fields, especially those related to biology, psychology, or environmental sciences.

   \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.6\)

4. **Estimate \(P(\neg H)\)**: This is simply \(1 - P(H)\).

   \(P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\)

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 = 0.08 + 0.48 = 0.56
\]

Therefore:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.56} = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \approx 0.143
\]

Hence, the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\):

{
  "computer science": "0.143"
