To approach this problem, let's break down the probabilities:

1. **P(H)** - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a computer science program.
2. **P(E|H)** - The probability of observing the personality sketch E (Adam's characteristics) given that he is enrolled in computer science.
3. **P(E|¬H)** - The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that he is not enrolled in computer science.
4. **P(H|E)** - The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch.

### Estimation
- **P(H)**: We need to estimate the likelihood that a typical graduate student might be studying computer science. Let's assume it's somewhat common but not predominant. We'll estimate it at 0.2.

- **P(E|H)**: Given that Adam is in computer science, we evaluate how likely his characteristics fit into this field. While computer science students can have a range of interests and traits, Adam's strong intelligence and abstract thinking are good fits. However, his love for nature and animals might be less typical. So, we'll estimate this at 0.4.

- **P(E|¬H)**: If Adam is not in computer science, he could be in many other fields such as biology, environmental science, philosophy, etc., where his traits might be more common. Since there are many other graduate programs where his personality sketch might fit well, we estimate this to be slightly higher. Let's say 0.6.

### Bayes' Rule
Bayes' rule allows us to calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.48 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.56 \]

Now, calculating \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.143 \]

Therefore, for the field of computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.143"
