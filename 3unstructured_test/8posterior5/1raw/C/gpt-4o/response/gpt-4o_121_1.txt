Sure, let's go through the process step-by-step. First, we'll outline the probabilities as described, and then apply Bayes' rule:

**Prior Probability, P(H):**
This is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Since he is a graduate student in the U.S., we can assume a relatively even distribution of students across different fields, but computer science is a popular field. For simplicity, we'll assign P(H) = 0.20.

**Likelihood, P(E|H):**
This is the probability of Adam having those personality traits given that he is enrolled in computer science. The traits include a curiosity about nature and plants, quiet demeanor, puzzle-solving interest, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and understanding of hard work. Some of these traits are common or compatible with personalities seen in computer science students, though some like empathy and love for nature might be less frequent but certainly possible.

Given the variability, let us assume P(E|H) = 0.30.

**Likelihood, P(E|¬H):**
This is the probability of Adam having those personality traits given that he is not enrolled in computer science. Considering these characteristics, it seems they are not strongly aligned with any specific field and could be distributed across various fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc.

We will assume P(E|¬H) = 0.15, as there's a lesser likelihood overall but still significant due to a broad distribution across other fields.

**Applying Bayes' Rule:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.80 \)

Now we calculate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \times 0.20}{(0.30 \times 0.20) + (0.15 \times 0.80)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.12} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.18} =  \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]

Thus, our result is:

  "computer science": "0.33"
