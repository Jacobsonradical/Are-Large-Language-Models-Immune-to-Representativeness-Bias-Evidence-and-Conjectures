To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider the following probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in computer science.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was not enrolled in computer science.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, which we will compute using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \).

### Estimations for computer science:
1. **P(H)**: Let's assume that the prior probability of Adam being a computer science student is 0.1 (10%) based on general enrollment statistics.
2. **P(E|H)**: Given that computer science students can have a strong understanding of abstract concepts and problem-solving skills (correlating with Adam's interest in puzzles and intelligence), but may be less likely to be characterized by a deep curiosity about nature and plants, warm hearts, and empathy, we might estimate this to be about 0.2.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: For the general population of non-computer science students, the personality traits described could vary widely. Let's estimate this probability at 0.1 as it is less specialized.

Now we compute:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.1 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.09 = 0.11 \]

Next, apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.11} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.11} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.182 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.182.
