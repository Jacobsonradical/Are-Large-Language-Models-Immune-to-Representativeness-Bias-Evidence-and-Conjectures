To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is constant for all fields, we can interpret the problem in terms of proportional relationships rather than actual probabilities calculating with values. This means we will make some qualitative assessments although exact quantitative values aren't given. We will estimate the probabilities based on the given personality traits and match them with the field.

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. 
   - Since we don't have specific information to favor any field, we can assume a uniform distribution across all possible fields (e.g., Biology, Environmental Science, Computer Science, etc.).

2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - Adam's characteristics such as curiosity, solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align reasonably well with traits typically associated in computer science graduate students. So, we might estimate this higher.
   
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
   - We would consider the likelihood of Adam's characteristics if he was enrolled in another field. Since his personality traits could suit many fields (like environmental science due to his curiosity about nature or psychology due to his empathy), this might also be reasonably high but not necessarily indicative of computer science alone.

Let’s assign some qualitative degrees to these assessments:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \): Assuming an equal possibility among roughly five feasible fields.
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \): Good alignment with computer science student traits.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4 \): Adam's traits could also match other fields, so not as strong.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

\[
P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16
\]

This is a rough estimation. As it is a qualitative assessment:

{
  "computer science": 0.16
}

This value should be normalized against the sum of similar calculations across all fields, but given we don’t do it here, the qualitative assessment highlights a moderate probability that Adam could be enrolled in computer science considering his personality and interests.
