Let's break this down step by step to apply Bayes' theorem for the given hypothesis \( H \) (that Adam was enrolled in computer science) given the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch).

Bayes' Theorem is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was indeed enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

First, let's make some estimations:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   This is the general likelihood that a random graduate student in the U.S. was enrolled in computer science in 2021.
   - Let's assume there's about a 1 in 10 chance, or 0.1 (10%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   This is the likelihood of Adam having the stated personality traits if he was enrolled in computer science.
   - Given Adam's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and interest in abstract concepts (traits common among many computer science students), we might estimate this relatively high, say 0.6.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   This is the likelihood of Adam having the stated personality traits if he was not enrolled in computer science.
   - These traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, warm heart, empathy) could fit many other fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc. Therefore, let's estimate this as 0.3.

4. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \):**
   This is a normalization factor that ensures the probabilities across all hypotheses sum to 1. It is given by:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   - \(\neg H\) denotes the negation of \( H \) (not computer science), which has a probability \( 1 - P(H) \).
   - So, \( P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 = 0.06 + 0.27 = 0.33 \).

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.33} \approx 0.1818 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.1818.
