To compute \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is formulated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.

### Step-by-Step Calculations

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science is 0.2 (this is an estimate and can vary based on actual data).

\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]

2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's traits, he could be somewhat likely to be in computer science due to his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts. However, traits like a warm heart, empathy, and love for animals might not be as central. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be a bit lower, say 0.3.

\[ P(E|H) = 0.3 \]

3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For fields other than computer science, such as biology or psychology, Adam's traits might fit more naturally. So, we'll assign a higher probability to \( P(E|\neg H) \), say 0.7.

\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \]

4. **Calculate \( P(E) \)**: This can be derived using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.56 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.62 \]

5. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.097 \]
