Given the provided information, we can make educated guesses about the probabilities. Keep in mind these are heuristic approximations.

1. **P(H)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Since computer science is quite a popular field, especially for someone with high intelligence and good abstract thinking skills, we can assume it is reasonably likely. Let's say P(H) = 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having these personality traits given that he was enrolled in computer science. High intelligence and interest in puzzles align well with computer science, though some aspects like empathy and love for animals are not specifically related but not contradictory either. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.5 (50%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam having these personality traits given that he was not enrolled in computer science. Adam's traits are quite general and could fit into many fields. Hence, let's assume P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 (10%).

We can now use Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.5 * 0.2) + (0.1 * 0.8) = 0.1 + 0.08 = 0.18 \]

So,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 * 0.2}{0.18} \approx 0.556 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.556.

This is a heuristic approximation and the actual probabilities can vary based on more detailed data and context.
