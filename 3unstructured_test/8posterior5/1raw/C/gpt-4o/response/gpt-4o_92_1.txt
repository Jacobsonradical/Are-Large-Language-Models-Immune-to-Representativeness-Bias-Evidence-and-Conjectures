To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \). Then we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence (E) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence (E) given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence (E), which can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's assume some reasonable estimations:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability that any given student is enrolled in computer science is moderate, say 0.15 (15%).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's interests and skills, it seems likely but not certain that he could be in computer science. Let's estimate this at 0.4 (40%).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given the same traits, it's also possible he could be in other fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. So, let's estimate this to be lower, say 0.25 (25%).

Now we can calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.15) + (0.25 \times 0.85) = 0.06 + 0.2125 = 0.2725 \]

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.4 \times 0.15)}{0.2725} = \frac{0.06}{0.2725} \approx 0.22 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.22 (22%).
