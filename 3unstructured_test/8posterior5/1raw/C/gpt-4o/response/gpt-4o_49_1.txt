Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **P(H):** The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science initially might be considered to be moderate, given that computer science is a common field among graduate students, but not overly popular among students who have a strong empathy and appreciation for nature and animals. Let's assume P(H) = 0.2.

2. **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits if he were enrolled in computer science. While computer science students can indeed have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, the strong empathy for nature and animals might not be a primary trait related to the field. Therefore, P(E|H) could be considered somewhat moderate. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.3.

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits if he were not enrolled in computer science. Since there are fields more aligned with his traits (such as biology or environmental science), P(E|¬H) might be relatively higher. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.5.

Using Bayes' Rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.4 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.46 \]

Therefore,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.13 \]

Given an initial moderate probability, yet the personality sketch not fully aligning with what might be expected, it resulted in a lower posterior probability.

But for simplicity and various hypothetical assumptions, let's reasonably set the approximate value at:

\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.2 \]

This reflects the idea that while it is plausible, other fields might more strongly match his personality profile.
