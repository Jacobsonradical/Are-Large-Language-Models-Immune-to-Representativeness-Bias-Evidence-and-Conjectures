To compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch E, we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality traits E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality traits E given that Adam was NOT enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality traits E.

We don't have exact values for these probabilities, so we will estimate them qualitatively based on the provided personality sketch.

### Estimates:
1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - Since computer science is a common field of study for intelligent students with abstract thinking, but not necessarily for those with a strong love for nature and animals, we can estimate this probability to be moderate.
   \[ P(H) \approx 0.3 \]

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described personality traits if he were studying computer science.
   - While some computer science students may have these traits, they are not strongly correlated with computer science. The traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy might not be typical for someone who is predominantly focused on computer science.
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \]

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described personality traits if he were not studying computer science.
   - Since the traits seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or similar disciplines, we can assume this probability to be higher.
   \[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \]

4. **\( P(E) \)**: The overall likelihood of Adam having the described personality traits.
   - This value needs to balance the overall distribution and should fall somewhere within the plausible range.
   \[ P(E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
   Where \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \):
   \[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.7 \cdot 0.7) \]
   \[ P(E) \approx 0.03 + 0.49 \]
   \[ P(E) \approx 0.52 \]

### Calculation using Bayesâ€™ Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.52} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.52} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.058 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.058.
