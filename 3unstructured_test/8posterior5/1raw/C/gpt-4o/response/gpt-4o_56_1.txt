To apply Bayes' rule to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch \(E\):

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Given the personality traits listed, we can assess these probabilities qualitatively:

**Probabilities:**

1. **P(H)** - Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - Let's assume, as a baseline, the prior probability that a random graduate student is in computer science given various fields available. This could be estimated around 0.1 (10%) based on general enrollment statistics.
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **P(E|H)** - Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science.
   - Traits like high intelligence and an affinity for solving puzzles do align well with qualities beneficial for computer science students. However, the deep love for animals and nature curiosity may not be as directly related.
   - Estimating this to be moderate to high: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \)

3. **P(E|\neg H)** - Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in computer science.
   - Given the traits, they could apply to various other fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, etc.
   - Therefore, this probability is likely somewhat high as well: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \)

4. **P(E)** - Overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.
   - Using the law of total probability: 
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
   - \( P(E) \approx (0.5 * 0.1) + (0.3 * 0.9) = 0.05 + 0.27 = 0.32 \)

**Bayes' Rule Calculation:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.1}{0.32} \approx \frac{0.05}{0.32} \approx 0.156 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch:
