To determine the likelihood that Adam was studying computer science given his personality sketch (E), we need to evaluate and assign probabilities to the three key components required to apply Bayes' theorem:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. **P(E|H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

Let's estimate each probability:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was studying computer science. Assuming there are many fields Adam could be studying and given no additional context about his preferences or background, we can assume a roughly uniform prior. For simplicity, let's say there are about 10 different common fields he could be studying, giving P(H) = 1/10 = 0.1.

2. **P(E|H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch (E) would be seen given he is in computer science. Computer science students often enjoy solving puzzles and are usually of high intelligence and good at abstract thinking. However, the strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals are not characteristics strongly correlated with computer science.

   Given these considerations, we may assign a moderate probability to this:
   Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.3.

3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability that Adam's personality sketch would be seen given he is not in computer science. The characteristics such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy might fit other fields better, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. 

   Let's estimate P(E|¬H) as being higher than P(E|H), say P(E|¬H) = 0.7.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where 
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.63 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.66 \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.0455 \]

Now, we convert this to a value between 0 and 1:

{
  "computer science": "0.0455"
}

This indicates that given Adam's personality sketch, there is approximately a 4.55% chance he was studying computer science.
