To calculate the probability of Adam being enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch (E), we start by assessing the prior probability \(P(H)\) of a graduate student being in computer science, the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) of Adam's personality given that he is in computer science, and the likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\) of Adam's personality given that he is not in computer science. We will then use Bayes' rule to find \(P(H|E)\).

Let's make some reasonable assumptions for these probabilities:

1. **Prior probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - The field of computer science is popular among graduate students. Let's assume \(P(H) = 0.2\).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)** (probability of his personality given he is in computer science):
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy may not be directly tied to an interest in computer science, but problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts fit well. So let's estimate \(P(E|H) = 0.3\).

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\)** (probability of his personality given he is not in computer science):
   - Given his personality sketch, Adam could fit into various other fields, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. Therefore, \(P(E|\neg H)\) should be higher. Let's estimate \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.7\).

Now we can use Bayes' rule to find \(P(H|E)\):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.56} = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \approx 0.097
\]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.097 or 9.7%.
