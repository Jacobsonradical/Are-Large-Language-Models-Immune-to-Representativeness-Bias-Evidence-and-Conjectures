To compute the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to make reasonable estimates for:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in computer science.

Let's make some qualitative assessments here:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: As computer science is a common graduate field, we can estimate this at around 0.2, or 20%, given the wide range of fields Adam could be in.

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Considering that Adam's love for nature, animals, and his empathy might not directly align with the typical engineer profile in computer science, but his high intelligence and problem-solving skills do, we can estimate this moderately. Let's say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: Given Adam's interests in nature, animals, and puzzles, fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology might be more probable, so \( P(E|\neg H) \) could be higher. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6 \).

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of \( E \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given:
\[ P(E|H) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \]

We first calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.48 = 0.54 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.111 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch \( E \) is approximately:
