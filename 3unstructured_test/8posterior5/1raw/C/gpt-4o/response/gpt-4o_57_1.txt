Sure, let's break down and analyze the problem using Bayes' theorem.

**Bayes' theorem** states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we can find \( P(H|E) \) after determining the values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's assume the following:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science without knowing his personality sketch. Given the popularity of the field, letâ€™s hypothesize this to be around 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that Adam's personality sketch would be as described if he were in computer science. Since Adam has qualities (high intelligence, good with abstract concepts) that fit well with computer science students, but not typically associated to nature and animals, let's hypothesize this to be about 0.3.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability that Adam's personality sketch would be as described if he were not in computer science. Given these personality traits may be more common in fields related to biology, environmental science, or veterinary science, let's hypothesize this to be around 0.7.

Now we can use these estimates to compute \( P(H|E) \).

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.1) + (0.7 \times 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.63 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.66 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.3 \times 0.1)}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.045 \]

Therefore:
