  "Let's evaluate the probabilities:

  P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science. Since Computer Science is a common graduate field in the U.S., we might set P(H) to a moderate value, say 0.3.

  P(E|H): The probability that Adam's personality sketch E is observed given that he is enrolled in Computer Science. Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, it supports the hypothesis that he might be in Computer Science, but his empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work might be less typical in this field. So, we might set P(E|H) to a moderate value, say 0.4.

  P(E|\neg H): The probability that Adam's personality sketch E is observed given that he is not enrolled in Computer Science. This would depend on the alternatives; graduate fields can vary greatly. Since the sketch fits well with several other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science), we might set P(E|\neg H) to around 0.5.

  Now, we use Bayes' rule:
  P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H)]

  P(H|E) = [0.4 * 0.3] / [0.4 * 0.3 + 0.5 * (1 - 0.3)]
         = [0.12] / [0.12 + 0.5 * 0.7]
         = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.35]
         = 0.12 / 0.47
         â‰ˆ 0.255

  Therefore, our final value for P(H|E) is approximately 0.255.

  So, the answer will be:
  0.255"
