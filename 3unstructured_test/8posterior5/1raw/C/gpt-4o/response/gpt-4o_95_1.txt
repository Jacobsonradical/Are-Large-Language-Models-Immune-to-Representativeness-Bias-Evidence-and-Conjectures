To calculate the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch (E), we will use Bayes' rule, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll need to estimate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing the personality sketch (can be computed or can infer it indirectly).

By examining the characteristics provided in the personality sketch, we can make educated estimates for these probabilities. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **P(H)**:
   - Statistics suggest that a notable percentage of U.S. graduate students are enrolled in computer science due to its popularity. Let's estimate this probability to be around 20% (0.2).

2. **P(E|H)**:
   - Adamâ€™s traits such as high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts align well with qualities that would benefit a computer science student. He also likes solving puzzles, which matches well with problem-solving in computer science.
   - However, specific traits like a deep love for animals and nature curiosity aren't particularly correlated with computer science.
   - Thus, we might give a moderate probability, let's say 0.4.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**:
   - Adam's personality sketch seems to lean towards fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology due to traits like empathy, a love for animals, and nature curiosity.
   - These fields might have probabilities equal to or potentially higher than computer science regarding these traits.
   - Let's estimate this probability to be 0.6.

4. **P(E)**:
   - This is tricky to compute directly, but since it represents the overall probability of observing the personality sketch regardless of the field, we can infer it using the total probability.
   - For simplicity and because we aren't given explicit data, we'll assume \( P(E) \) normalizes everything to keep the consistencies. We could roughly approximate this as similarly distributed among graduate fields but assume a normalizing approach that balances given probabilities.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given our estimates:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \approx P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \):

\[ P(E) \approx 0.4 \times 0.2 + 0.6 \times 0.8 \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.08 + 0.48 = 0.56 \]

Then:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.56} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.56} \approx 0.143 \]

So the final computed probability is roughly:
