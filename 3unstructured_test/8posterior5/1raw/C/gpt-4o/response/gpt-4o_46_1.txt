To tackle this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to consider the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science.

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can expand the denominator using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's make a reasonable estimation for these probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) (The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science)
   - Let's assume that the prior probability of a graduate student in the U.S. being enrolled in computer science is around 0.20 (20%). 

2. \( P(E|H) \) (The probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in computer science)
   - Given the sketch, Adam appears to be more oriented toward nature, puzzles, animals, and empathy. These traits are not classically aligned with computer science but are not incompatible either. Letâ€™s give this a moderate-low likelihood of 0.30 (30%).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) (The probability of the personality sketch given Adam is not enrolled in computer science)
   - Since there are several fields (e.g., biology, environmental science, psychology) where the described traits are more aligned, the likelihood of such a sketch is higher for students in non-CS fields. We estimate this around 0.70 (70%).

Now, we can estimate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.30 \cdot 0.20) + (0.70 \cdot 0.80) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.56 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.62 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.0968 \]

Rounded to two decimal places:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.10 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch is approximately 10%.

Therefore, the answer is:

{
  "computer science": "0.10"
