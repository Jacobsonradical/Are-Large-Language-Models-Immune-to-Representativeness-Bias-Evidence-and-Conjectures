To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch (assuming all possible fields of study).

Let's assign some reasonable values to these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: 
   Given the wide range of fields of study in graduate school, the probability \( P(H) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science can be estimated around 0.1 (10%), considering the diversity of graduate programs.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Considering Adam's traits like a love for abstract concepts, high intelligence, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, which are typically associated with computer science, we might estimate this probability relatively high, say 0.6 (60%).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   Since the personality sketch indicates a love for nature, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, which might be more aligned with fields such as biology or environmental science rather than computer science, this value might be lower, say 0.2 (20%).

4. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: 
   Since \( P(E) \) can be calculated based on all possible fields, it's a weighted average of \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), based on their priors.

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot (1 - P(H)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 = 0.06 + 0.18 = 0.24 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.24} = \frac{0.06}{0.24} = 0.25 \]

Therefore,
