To apply Bayes' rule and compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in a field other than computer science.

Let's first estimate these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   Let's assume a rough estimate for the prior probability that a randomly chosen U.S. graduate student is in computer science. Let's say it's around 0.1 (10%).

   \( P(H) = 0.1 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   Given Adam's personality sketch, we can consider how well it matches a typical computer science graduate student. Computer science students often need to solve complex problems (matching Adam's puzzle-solving interest), understand abstract concepts, and may have quiet and introspective personalities. However, the strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals might be a bit less common but not unlikely. So, let's estimate this likelihood as moderately high, say 0.4 (40%).

   \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \)

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**
   Now consider the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were in a different field. Fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or even certain humanities might also match Adam's traits well due to the need for empathy, love for nature, and understanding abstract concepts. These fields might match his personality sketch quite well. So, let's estimate this likelihood as higher than \( P(E|H) \), say 0.6 (60%).

   \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \)

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

where

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.54 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.58 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.58} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.58} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.069 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.069 (6.9%).
