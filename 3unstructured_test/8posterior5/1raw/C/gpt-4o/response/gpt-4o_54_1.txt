To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given the personality sketch E, we need to assess three probabilities: P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H).

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Since Adam is a graduate student in the U.S., and computer science is a common field among graduate students, we could assume a moderately high prior probability, but not too high without strong evidence. For simplicity, let's assume P(H) = 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in computer science. Computer science students often have high intelligence and are good at solving puzzles. However, genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals are not typically associated specifically with computer science students. Thus, let's assume P(E|H) = 0.1.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in computer science. Given that Adam's personality includes interests and traits that do not strongly align with computer science, this probability could be higher because there are other fields where these traits are more common. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.3.

Now, apply Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|¬H) P(¬H) \), we find:

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.077 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.077.
