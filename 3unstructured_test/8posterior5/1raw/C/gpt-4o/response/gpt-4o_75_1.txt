To apply Bayes' rule to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, let's breakdown the terms required: \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as a graduate student.
   
   Given that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, we'll assume a rough estimate of the proportion of graduate students in computer science. It's reasonable to estimate this around \(0.1\) (10%) because computer science is one of the popular fields.

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood that Adam has the qualities described in E given that he is indeed enrolled in computer science.
   
   Adam's curiosity about nature, appreciation for dedication, intelligence, and love for puzzles match well with characteristics often associated with computer science students. However, the strong empathy and love for animals might be slightly less common among computer science students but still quite plausible.
   
   Given his personality sketch, let's assign a high likelihood, though not perfect, around \(0.7\).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood that Adam has the qualities described in E given that he is not enrolled in computer science.
   
   Now, considering that there are many other fields that fit his personality traits just as well (e.g., biology, psychology, environmental science), this likelihood might still be relatively high, around \(0.5\). 

Now we use Bayes' rule to compute:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Firstly, we compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) = 0.07 + 0.45 = 0.52 \]

Then, we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.52} = \frac{0.07}{0.52} \approx 0.135 \]

So the probability \( P(H|E) \) is approximately \( 0.135 \).
