Let's evaluate the probabilities step-by-step for the field of computer science:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Since we don't have specific information about Adam's prior interests or choices, we can assume a uniform distribution among possible fields of study. Typically, graduate fields are numerous, but let's assume there are approximately 10 primary fields he could be in. This would give us:
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1
   \]

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence (E) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Computer science students can certainly have a high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and problem-solving abilities. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals is less common in typical computer science students. Given that some computer science students could be interested in these things, but it's not the norm, we might set:
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.3
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the evidence given Adam is not enrolled in computer science. If Adam is in another field, such as biology or environmental science, these traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.) might be more common. Estimating this broader range among various fields:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) = 0.7
   \]

Now, using Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.7 \cdot 0.9) = 0.03 + 0.63 = 0.66
\]

Therefore:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.66} = \frac{0.03}{0.66} \approx 0.0455
\]

So the probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science given the evidence is approximately 0.0455, or 4.55%.
