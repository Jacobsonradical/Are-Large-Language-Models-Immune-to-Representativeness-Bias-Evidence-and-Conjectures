To solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem, we need to follow a series of steps to evaluate our probability values:

1. **Judging Probability Values:**

   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science.

2. **Bayes' Theorem:**

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume the following estimates based on the provided personality sketch and general knowledge about fields of study:

- Prior probability \( P(H) \): We'll consider a rough estimate where computer science is one of the possible fields among many that a graduate student could enroll in. Let's say there are 10 possible fields that Adam could be in, giving \( P(H) \) a value of roughly 0.1.

- \( P(E|H) \): Considering the traits described in the personality sketch:
  - Adam is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which are crucial for computer science.
  - Solving puzzles aligns well with the logical and problem-solving skills needed in computer science.
  - The only traits not perfectly aligned are his love for nature and animals, which is less directly related to computer science.
  
  Given these traits, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as moderately high, maybe around 0.6.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is not in computer science. Given that there are many fields (such as biology, environmental science, etc.) where his love for nature and animals, combined with his intelligence and problem-solving skills, would align well, let's estimate this value as slightly higher than \( P(E|H) \) due to the nature-oriented traits. Let's set \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.7.

Now we calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 0.7 \cdot 0.9} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.63} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.69} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.087 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.087, or 8.7%.

Here is the answer in the specified format:
