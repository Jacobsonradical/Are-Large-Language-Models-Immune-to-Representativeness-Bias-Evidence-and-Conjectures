To answer this question using Bayes' rule, we need to calculate the probabilities involved:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing E (Adam's personality sketch) given that H (he is enrolled in computer science) is true.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing E given that H is not true.

Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Estimate the Probabilities

**P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Given the popularity of computer science as a graduate field and its broad applicability, let's assume that P(H) is 0.20 (20%).

**P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in computer science. Adam's interests and traits, such as a love for solving puzzles and high intelligence, align quite well with the field of computer science. Let's assume this probability to be 0.70 (70%).

**P(E|\neg H)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in computer science. The traits described could belong to a student in many other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science, psychology). Let's assume this probability to be lower, say 0.30 (30%).

### Step 2: Bayes' Rule Calculation

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

First, calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.70 \times 0.20) + (0.30 \times 0.80) = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38 \]

Now, use Bayes' rule to find \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \times 0.20}{0.38} = \frac{0.14}{0.38} \approx 0.368 \]

### Step 3: Formulate the Answer
