To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science (H) given his personality sketch (E), we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the following:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science.
4. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.

Let's break this down:

1. \( P(H) \): Assuming there's no strong prior data suggesting any particular field, we can assign a general probability. Let's say, given the diversity of graduate fields, we assign a base rate of 0.1 (10% chance) for any specific major.
   
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam's personality includes high intelligence and an interest in abstract concepts, it's reasonable to assume he could be in computer science. However, his deep love for nature, animals, and solving tangible puzzles might make this less likely but not negligible. Let's estimate it as 0.4.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): Without being in computer science, Adam's interests and personality could align with various other fields (biology, environmental science, psychology, etc.) that might match better. Therefore, the probability could be higher here. Let's assign it a value of 0.6.

4. \( P(E) \): The overall likelihood of the combination of traits in E can be derived from the sum of both scenarios weighted by their priors.
   
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.54 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.58 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.58} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.58} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.069 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.069, or 6.9%.
