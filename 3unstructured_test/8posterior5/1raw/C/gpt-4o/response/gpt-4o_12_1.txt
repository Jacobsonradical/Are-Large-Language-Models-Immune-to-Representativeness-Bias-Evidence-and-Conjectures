To compute \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis \( H \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021, we'll use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's the necessary breakdown:

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Without specific information about the distribution of graduate students among different fields, we'll consider \( P(H) = 0.1 \). This is an educated guess based on computer science being a popular field, but not assuming it is overly predominant amongst all fields.

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science. Given Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts, curiosity about nature, and puzzle-solving skills, these traits fit quite well with a computer science background. However, the strong empathy and deep love for animals are not typical core traits associated with the stereotype of computer science students.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science. The traits described may fit well in many other fields such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology, which may stress empathy and a love of animals more than computer science.
   - Assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

4. **\( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing Adamâ€™s personality sketch, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \times 0.1) + (0.6 \times 0.9) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.05 + 0.54 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.59 \]

Now, we use Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.1}{0.59} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.59} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.085 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.085.
