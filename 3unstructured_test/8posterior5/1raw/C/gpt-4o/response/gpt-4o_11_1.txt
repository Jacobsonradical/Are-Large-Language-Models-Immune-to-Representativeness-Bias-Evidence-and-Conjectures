To solve for \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to first understand each term:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
4. \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we often rewrite \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Here are assumptions and approximate values for each term:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \): Assuming a low prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, as it's a common but not overwhelmingly prevalent field.
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \): Given Adam's interests (nature, animals, empathy), it's less likely but not impossible, as people in computer science can also have diverse interests.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.3 \): It's somewhat more likely that someone with Adam's profile could be in a field outside of computer science (e.g., biology, ecology).

Now, calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.27 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.069 \]

Thus, the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.069.
