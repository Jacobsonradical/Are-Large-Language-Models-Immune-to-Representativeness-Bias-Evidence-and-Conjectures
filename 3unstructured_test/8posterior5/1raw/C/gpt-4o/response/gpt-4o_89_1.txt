To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in "computer science" given his personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' rule, which is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E| \neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch. 

We need to make subjective judgments and assumptions to assign values to these probabilities.

### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
We consider the probability that a random graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume a moderate prior, given the popularity of the field, but recognizing other fields are also common.

\[ P(H) = 0.2 \]

### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Next, we evaluate how likely Adam's personality traits fit a computer science student:
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts align well.
- Enjoys solving puzzles fits strongly with computer science.
- Curiosity about nature and deep love for animals is less typical but not impossible.

Assuming moderate alignment:

\[ P(E|H) = 0.5 \]

### Likelihood \( P(E| \neg H) \)
Now, for other fields, these personality traits can be common too, especially in fields like biology, environmental sciences, etc.

Assuming moderate to high commonality in non-CS fields:

\[ P(E| \neg H) = 0.6 \]

### Normalizing Constant \( P(E) \)
This is the total probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be broken down into:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E| \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting values:

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) = 0.1 + 0.48 = 0.58 \]

### Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)
Finally, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.58} \approx 0.1724 \]

Putting it all together:

{
  "computer science": "0.1724"
