First, let's specify what each term means:
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was not enrolled in computer science.
- \(P(H|E)\): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality traits.

Based on the description of Adam, we need to consider whether his personality traits align with the field of computer science.

1. **\(P(H)\):** 
   - The prior probability depends on general enrollment statistics. Let's assume that computer science is quite popular and has decent enrollment rates among graduate students, we might assign \(P(H)\) a moderate value.
   - For example, let's arbitrarily set \(P(H)\) = 0.2 (20% chance he’s enrolled in computer science).

2. **\(P(E|H)\):**
   - In computer science, attributes like high intelligence and abstract thinking are highly relevant. However, Adam’s specific traits like strong empathy, curiosity about nature and plants, and a love for animals may not be as strongly aligned with typical computer science archetypes.
   - Let's assign a moderate to low probability for \(P(E|H)\):
   - For example, let's assume \(P(E|H)\) = 0.3.

3. **\(P(E|\neg H)\):**
   - This is the probability of observing his traits in fields other than computer science. Given his strong empathy, curiosity about nature, and animal love, these traits might be more common in fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology.
   - Let's assign a relatively higher probability for \(P(E|\neg H)\):
   - For example, let’s assume \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 0.6.

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Calculating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.6 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.48 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.54 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.54} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{6}{54} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.111 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality traits is approximately:
