To solve the problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to determine the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). Finally, we can compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \).

1. Prior probability \( P(H) \):
   - Since we don't have specific prior probabilities for Adam's likelihood of being enrolled in various fields, let's assume a uniform distribution over common graduate fields, such as computer science, biology, engineering, etc.

2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
   - We evaluate how likely Adam's personality sketch (E) is, given that he is in computer science (H). Although computer science students can have diverse personalities, a strong curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and emphasis on abstract concepts may be less prominent. Let's assume that uniqueness reduces this likelihood slightly.

3. Probability of the evidence \( P(E) \):
   - This represents the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields. Since Adam has certain distinctive traits, we'll consider this as a mixed set of traits found in various disciplines.

4. Let's assign rough estimated values based on reasoning:

- \( P(H) \) (prior for computer science): 0.2 (assuming 5 likely fields)
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood of having Adam's traits in computer science): 0.1
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (likelihood of having Adam's traits in fields other than computer science): 0.75

To apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since \( \neg H = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \):
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.75 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.62 \]

Then, the posterior probability:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.62} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.032 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately:
