Sure, let's determine the required probabilities to apply Bayes' rule.

Given:
- E is the personality sketch.
- H is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

We'll start by assessing the probabilities:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Assuming Adam is a student in a broad range of fields, let's assume there's a reasonable common likelihood for computer science. For simplicity, we can assign a neutral likelihood, for instance, \( P(H) = 0.10 \). This value can change depending on more specific data about the distribution of fields in graduate studies.
   
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is a computer science student. Adam has a love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts, which can fit moderately well with computer science (abstract problem-solving) but might not be a perfect fit for someone typically interested in nature and animals. For this, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not a computer science student. Considering Adam's traits (nature, animals, empathy, and interest in abstract concepts), it’s moderately probable he might be in fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology—fields that might be considered more fitting. Let's assume \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \).

Now, we will calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

With the values:
\[ P(H) = 0.10 \]
\[ \neg P(H) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.6 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.10) + (0.6 \cdot 0.90) = 0.03 + 0.54 = 0.57 \]

Finally:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.10}{0.57} = \frac{0.03}{0.57} \approx 0.0526 \]

So the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch is approximately \(0.0526\).
