To compute \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch), we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate each of these probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Let's say the prior probability of a graduate student studying computer science is fairly common, so we might somewhat arbitrate it as 0.2.

2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is enrolled in computer science. Considering the curiosity, intelligence, and problem-solving skills align well with computer science, this probability might be relatively high. Letâ€™s assume \( P(E|H) \) to be 0.6.

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch if he is not enrolled in computer science. Given that these traits are also well-suited for other fields such as biology, psychology, or even environmental science, this probability could be significant but slightly lower than \( P(E|H) \). Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) as 0.4.

4. \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence, which we can calculate using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.2) + (0.4 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.32 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.44 \]

Now, apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.6 \times 0.2)}{0.44} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.44} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2727 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.2727.
