To predict the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on the personality sketch provided, we need to make educated guesses about the probabilities involved. Here's how we might proceed:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Let's assume 0.2 as a rough estimate, considering there are multiple fields he could be enrolled in.
  
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
   - His intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and problem-solving skills align well with computer science, but his strong curiosity about nature and love for animals are not typically associated with this field.
   - Let's estimate this at 0.4.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science.
   - Given his characteristics, he could have been in several other fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, which might align well with his curiosity about nature and empathy.
   - Let's estimate this at 0.7.

Using Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, computed as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H)
\]

Given our estimates, we calculate \( P(E) \):

\[
P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.8) = 0.08 + 0.56 = 0.64
\]

So, plugging in the values:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{(0.4 \cdot 0.2)}{0.64} = \frac{0.08}{0.64} = 0.125
\]

So, the estimated probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is 0.125.
