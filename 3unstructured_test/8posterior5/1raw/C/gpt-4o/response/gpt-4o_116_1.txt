To determine the probability P(H|E) that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch E, we need to estimate the following components:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a computer science program.
2. P(E|H): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is a computer science student.
3. P(E|¬H): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is not a computer science student.

### Estimations:

- **P(H)**: This could be estimated based on overall enrollment statistics in the field. Suppose we assume there's a 10% chance that a randomly chosen graduate student is studying computer science. So, P(H) = 0.10.
  
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's quiet nature, problem-solving interest, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, it's moderately likely he could be in computer science but not exclusively so. Let's estimate this as 0.5.
  
- **P(E|¬H)**: Adam's interests and personality traits also fit many other fields, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. This means that the probability of observing E given Adam is not a computer science student is relatively high, let's estimate this as 0.4.

### Bayes' Rule Calculation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where: 
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot (1 - 0.1)) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 + 0.36 = 0.41 \]

Finally:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.41} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.41} \approx 0.122 \]

So we can conclude:
