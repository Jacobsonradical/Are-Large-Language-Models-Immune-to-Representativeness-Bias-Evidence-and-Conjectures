To apply Bayes' theorem to this problem, we need to estimate four probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the evidence.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions based on the provided information:

### Estimating \( P(H) \)

Given that there are many fields of study in graduate education, let's assume a uniform prior probability for simplicity. If there are, say, 20 common fields, the probability that Adam is in computer science might be:

\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{20} = 0.05 \]

### Estimating \( P(E|H) \)

Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles might have varying relevance to computer science. Since computer science students often work on abstract concepts and puzzles (which are relevant), but perhaps are not commonly known for a strong empathy towards animals and plants:

\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]

### Estimating \( P(E|\neg H) \)

Given Adam's characteristics, it's quite likely that he might be in fields related to biology, environmental science, or psychology, where his love for nature, plants, animals, and strong empathy and appreciation for hard work align well:

\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.1 \]

### Calculating \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[ 
P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.95) = 0.01 + 0.095 = 0.105
\]

So:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.05}{0.105} = \frac{0.01}{0.105} \approx 0.0952
\]

Hence, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately:
