To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we start by defining the relevant probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Based on the description of Adam:

1. \( P(H) \): The base rate or prior probability of a random graduate student in the U.S. being enrolled in computer science. Given CS is a relatively popular field, let's estimate it as 0.2 (20%).
2. \( P(E|H) \): How likely Adam's personality traits fit those typically associated with a computer science student. For example, high intelligence and an interest in puzzles are common in CS, but empathy and love for animals are not specific. Let's assign a moderate value of 0.5 (50%).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): How likely Adam's personality traits fit those of graduate students not in computer science. Given his traits seem reasonably common across other fields, let's estimate it as 0.2 (20%).

Now applying Bayes' rule:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} 
\]

Substituting in the estimated values:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.5 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.2)} 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.8} 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.16} 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.26} 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) \approx 0.385 
\]

Thus, the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science given his personality traits is approximately:
