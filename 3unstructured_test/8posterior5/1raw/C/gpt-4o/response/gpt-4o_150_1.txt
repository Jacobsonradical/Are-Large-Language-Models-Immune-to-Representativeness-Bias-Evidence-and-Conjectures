Sure, let's go through the steps using Bayes' rule to compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Without any additional information, we might assume the probability is roughly equal across various common graduate fields. Let's estimate P(H) = 1/10 = 0.1 (assuming 10 common fields).

2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Adam's love for solving puzzles, his high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. Empathy, curiosity about nature, and love for animals are less typical but not incompatible with the field. These factors combined lead us to rate this likelihood as relatively high. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.7.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science. Adam's traits are not exclusive to computer science; empathy, curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high intelligence can also be found in students from fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc. Thus, while it's somewhat less likely than the computer science hypothesis, it’s still considerable. Let's estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.5.

Using Bayes' rule, we calculate:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.45 = 0.52 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.52} \approx 0.1346 \]

Therefore:

  "computer science": "0.1346"
