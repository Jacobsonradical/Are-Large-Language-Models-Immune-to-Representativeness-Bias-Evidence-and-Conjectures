To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \). It can be derived from \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the given information.

### Assumptions and Reasoning:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Let's assume the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is moderate, as computer science is a common field for graduate students.
   - For simplicity, we'll estimate \( P(H) = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, appreciation for hard work), there could be some overlap with fields like computer science but not as strongly as fields like biology or environmental science.
   - Given the overlap with solving puzzles and high intelligence, we estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Given Adam's traits, other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science) would have a higher likelihood of fitting his personality sketch.
   - We estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

4. **Overall Probability \( P(E) \):**
   - Using our assumptions:
     \[
     P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
     \]
     \[
     P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.75) = 0.075 + 0.525 = 0.6
     \]

### Calculation:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.6} = \frac{0.075}{0.6} \approx 0.125
\]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.125.
