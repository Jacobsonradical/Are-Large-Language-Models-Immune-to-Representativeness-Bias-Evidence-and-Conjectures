To apply Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in a field like computer science given his personality sketch (E), we first need to define the probabilities P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H) as follows:

- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science.

For this example:

- P(H): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science compared to all other graduate fields.
- P(E|H): Since the sketch describes Adam as having a deep love for animals, nature, and puzzles, abstract thinking aligns with computer science but a love for nature is less typical. Consider that computer science students have diverse backgrounds nowadays. Thus we could assume that P(E|H) is moderate.
- P(E|¬H): This would be the probability of seeing such a personality sketch in any field except computer science.

For simplicity, let’s assume:
- P(H) = 0.1 (10% are computer science students among various fields).
- P(E|H) = 0.3 (30% since some traits align while others do not directly).
- P(E|¬H) = 0.05 (5% considering the specific combination of traits is less common elsewhere).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Now to plug the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.05 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.045 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.075 \]

Then,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.075} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.075} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.4 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
