To use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch E, we need to assess prior probabilities and likelihoods. Hereâ€™s how we go through the process:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Let's assume this to be the general probability among all graduate students. Suppose we assign \( P(H) \) a value based on general graduate student distribution; typically, computer science is a popular field, so let's assign it a value of 0.15.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in the field of computer science. The traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, high intelligence, appreciates hard work) are somewhat aligned with individuals in computer science but are not solely indicative. Let's reasonably estimate this probability to be moderately reflective and set it at 0.20.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in the field of computer science. These traits could fit many fields, such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology. Considering the widespread applicability of these traits, let's set this probability slightly higher, maybe at 0.25.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence which can be calculated as follows:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(E) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.25 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.03 + 0.2125 = 0.2425
\]

Now compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.2425} = \frac{0.03}{0.2425} \approx 0.1237
\]

So the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch E is approximately 0.1237.

Therefore, the answer is as follows:

{
  "computer science": "0.1237"
