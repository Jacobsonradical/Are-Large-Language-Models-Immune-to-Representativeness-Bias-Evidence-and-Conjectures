### Explanation:
- **P(H) - The prior probability that Adam was studying computer science:** Given he is a graduate student in the U.S., it is reasonable to assume the probability he is enrolled in computer science, one of the most common graduate programs, might be around 0.2 or less.
  
- **P(E|H) - The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis:** While computer science students can have diverse interests, Adam's intense curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals don't strongly align with the stereotypical profile of a computer science student. This probability might be around 0.4.

- **P(E|¬H) - The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is false:** Adam's traits seem more consistent with fields related to biology, environmental science, psychology, or even veterinary studies, rather than the narrower focus of computer science. This probability is higher, perhaps around 0.6.

### Applying Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \):

Let's assume:
- P(H) = 0.2
- P(E|H) = 0.4
- P(E|¬H) = 0.6
- P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8

\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.6 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.48 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.56 \]

Now apply Bayes Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.143 \]

Given the range for imprecise probabilities, one might round this value to around 0.15.
