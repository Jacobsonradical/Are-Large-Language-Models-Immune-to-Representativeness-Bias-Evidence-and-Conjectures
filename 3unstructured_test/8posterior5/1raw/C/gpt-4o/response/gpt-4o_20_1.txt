Let's consider the probability values needed to compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule. We need to estimate:

- \( P(H) \): the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

### Step-by-Step Estimation

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   
   Given that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, we need to consider the prevalence of computer science among graduate fields. Let's assume a modest estimate of around 10-20%, so we could say:
   \[
   P(H) \approx 0.15
   \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   
   Computer science students can be highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which matches Adam's profile. However, the other traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are less directly associated with a typical computer science profile. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as moderate:
   \[
   P(E|H) \approx 0.4
   \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   
   Considering Adamâ€™s empathy, love for animals, and nature, he could also fit well into fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary science, psychology, etc. Given these characteristics might be common in those fields, the probability of observing \( E \) given that Adam is in a non-computer science field could be slightly higher:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.6
   \]

### Applying Bayes' Rule
Bayes' Rule is:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where,
\[
P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)
\]
Substituting, we get:
\[
P(E) = (0.4)(0.15) + (0.6)(0.85) = 0.06 + 0.51 = 0.57
\]
Now,
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{(0.4)(0.15)}{0.57} = \frac{0.06}{0.57} \approx 0.105
\]

Therefore, the answer formatted as required:

{
  "computer science": "0.105"
}
