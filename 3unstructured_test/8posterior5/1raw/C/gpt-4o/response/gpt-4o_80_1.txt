Sure, let's apply Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on the given personality sketch.

Bayes' Theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch (normalizing constant).

First, we need to estimate each of these probabilities.

1. \( P(H) \) (the prior probability \( P(H) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science):
   - This will depend on the overall proportion of students enrolled in computer science among all fields. As a rough estimate, suppose that 10% of graduate students are enrolled in computer science.
   - Therefore, \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \).

2. \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science):
   - Students in computer science may or may not particularly exhibit Adam's traits, but many might excel at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.
   - Let's estimate a moderate probability since computer science students might have a mix: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \) (the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science):
   - Many other fields could exhibit the same characteristics like curiosity about nature and love for animals (e.g., biology, environmental science).
   - A wider pool of students could exhibit these traits, so let's estimate a higher probability: \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \).

Finally, \( P(E) \), the total probability of the personality sketch occurring, can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.10) + (0.5 \cdot 0.90) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.48 \]

Now we can compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.10}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.48} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0625 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.0625 (or 6.25%).
