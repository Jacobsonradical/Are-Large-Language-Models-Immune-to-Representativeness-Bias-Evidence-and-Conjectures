To determine the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science based on his personality sketch (E), we need to consider the following:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality traits given that he was enrolled in computer science.
3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The likelihood of Adam having his personality traits given that he was not enrolled in computer science.
4. **P(H|E)**: The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality traits, which we can find using Bayes' rule:

   \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \)

   Since \( P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \), 

   we can rewrite Bayes' rule as:

   \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \)

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - This depends on the general prevalence of the field. Let's assume that roughly 10% of graduate students are in computer science, so \(P(H)\) = 0.1.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam has high intelligence, likes puzzles, and understands abstract concepts, which are relevant traits for computer science.
   - Assuming that these traits are moderately common in computer science, we might estimate \(P(E|H) \approx 0.7\).

3. **Complement Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - Considering that these traits, especially a love for nature, animals, empathy, and hard work, are quite general and could appear in many other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science, psychology, etc.), itâ€™s reasonable to assume \(P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.4\).

4. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:
   - Plugging the numbers into Bayes' equation:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|\neg H) * P(\neg H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 * 0.1}{0.7 * 0.1 + 0.4 * 0.9}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.36}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.43}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx 0.1628
   \]
