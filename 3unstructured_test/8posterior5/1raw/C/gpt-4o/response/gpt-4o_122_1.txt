To estimate the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science (CS) based on the given personality sketch and prior probabilities, we need to make some informed guesses about the probabilities.

Let’s define the probabilities as follows:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in CS.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam was enrolled in CS.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam was not enrolled in CS.

Assuming the general distribution of graduate students across various fields, we may estimate the priors:

1. Let's assume \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a random graduate student was enrolled in CS, is around 0.2 (20%).

2. Given Adam’s personality sketch, specifically his love for nature, empathy, and warmth, which might not typically be associated with the stereotypical CS student, we might estimate that \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low. Let’s assume it to be around 0.1 (10%).

3. On the other hand, those traits might be more common in non-CS fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. Let’s estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be higher, say 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), the probability that Adam was enrolled in CS given his personality traits:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as follows:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Substitute the probabilities:

\[
P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.02 + 0.24 = 0.26
\]

Now, we compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} = \frac{0.02}{0.26} \approx 0.077
\]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.077, or 7.7%.

Here is the answer in the required format:
