To compute the conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch (E) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch (E) given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science.

Given the personality sketch, we need to make some judgments:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - This is a general estimate of the proportion of graduate students who are in computer science. Let's assume a moderate estimate, \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Considering Adam's personality traits, solving puzzles and high intelligence match well with someone in computer science. Nature, empathy, and love for animals might be less direct indicators but are not contradictory. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - The traits described are likely to fit students in other fields like biology, psychology, or environmental science even better. Hence, \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be higher. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.7 \).

Now, we need to calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \times 0.2) + (0.7 \times 0.8) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.1 + 0.56 = 0.66 \]

Finally, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.66} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.66} \approx 0.1515 \]

So, the probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.1515.
