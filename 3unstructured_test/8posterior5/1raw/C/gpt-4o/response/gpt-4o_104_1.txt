To apply Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch E, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch E.

Since we lack specific numerical values, we need to make reasonable estimates based on the information provided.

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that a graduate student might be enrolled in computer science.
   - Let's assume the rough proportion of graduate students in various fields. We can estimate \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (20%), given that computer science is a popular field.

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam’s personality traits if he were in computer science.
   - Computer science students can have a variety of interests and skills. However, Adam’s strong empathy, love for animals, and deep appreciation for dedication might be less typical but not impossible. A reasonable estimate could be \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \) (30%).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam’s personality traits if he were not in computer science.
   - Given Adam's traits such as a love for nature, animals, and strong empathy, it might be more likely for him to be in a field related to biology, environmental science, or social sciences. So we can estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.5 \) (50%).

4. **\( P(E) \)**: The total probability of the personality sketch.
   - This is a normalization factor computed from both \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \):
     \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
     \[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.06 + 0.4 = 0.46 \]

Now we can compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.46} \approx 0.13 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.13, or 13%.
