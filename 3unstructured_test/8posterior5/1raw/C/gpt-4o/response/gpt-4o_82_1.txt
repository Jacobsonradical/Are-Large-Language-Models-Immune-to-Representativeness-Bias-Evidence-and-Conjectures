To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch and background, we will need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was not enrolled in computer science.

For Bayes' theorem, we use the following formula to compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality traits. \( P(E) \) can be computed as follows:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

### Step-by-Step Estimation with Assumptions

1. **Estimated Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student could be enrolled in computer science is 0.2 (this is a ratio based on the general availability of various graduate study fields).

2. **Estimated Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Given that Adam was enrolled in computer science, the likelihood of having his traits (interest in nature, plants, solving puzzles, intelligence, etc.) could be estimated at 0.4. Graduates in computer science can have diverse interests including nature and puzzles, but not necessarily a strong inclination towards nature and animals.

3. **Estimated Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   - Now considering the likelihood outside of computer science, fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology might match Adam's traits more closely than computer science. Letâ€™s assume this likelihood to be higher, around 0.7.

### Computation:

1. **Calculate \( P(E) \):**
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.7 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.56 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.64 \]

2. **Compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.64} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.64} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.125 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality traits can be summarized as:
