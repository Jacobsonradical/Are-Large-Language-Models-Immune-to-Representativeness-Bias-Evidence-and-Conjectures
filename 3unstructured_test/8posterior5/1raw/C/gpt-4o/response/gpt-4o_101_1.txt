To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science before considering his personality sketch. We'll assume this is the general probability of any given graduate student in the U.S. being enrolled in computer science. For simplicity, let's assume it is 0.2 (or 20%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science. Since computer science students can exhibit traits such as high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, let's estimate this likelihood relatively high. Let's say 0.5.

3. **Prior Probability \( P(\neg H) \)**: This is the probability that Adam was not enrolled in computer science. Since \( P(H) = 0.2 \), \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \).

4. **Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science. Considering that Adam's traits (e.g., empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature) could be common in fields such as biology or environmental science, let's assume a moderate value for this likelihood. Let's say 0.3.

5. **Normalize the probabilities** using Bayes' Rule:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   where
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)
   \]

First, let's calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ 
P(E) = (0.5 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.8) = 0.1 + 0.24 = 0.34 
\]

Now, we can find \( P(H|E) \):
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.34} = \frac{0.1}{0.34} \approx 0.294
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.294.
