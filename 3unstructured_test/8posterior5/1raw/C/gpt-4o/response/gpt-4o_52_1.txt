To answer this question, let's break it down step by step using Bayes' Rule.

Bayesâ€™ Rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch E.

Let's make reasoned estimates for these probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - Suppose the prior probability of any graduate student being enrolled in computer science is around 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H)**: Probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - Given that Adam has a high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, these traits are favorable for computer science students. However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature might be less prevalent in this field. Thus, let's say this probability is moderate, around 0.3 (30%).

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: Probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
   - Given Adam's traits, he might be more likely to be found in fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Thus, this probability might be higher, let's estimate around 0.5 (50%).

4. **P(E)**: Overall probability of observing the personality sketch E. 
   - This can be computed from the law of total probability: 
     \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
     \[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.8) \]
     \[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.4 = 0.46 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.46} \approx 0.13 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.13.
