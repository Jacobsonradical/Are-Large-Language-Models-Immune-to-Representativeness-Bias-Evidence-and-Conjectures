To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define**:
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability that the personality sketch \( E \) is observed given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that the personality sketch \( E \) is observed given that Adam was NOT enrolled in computer science.

2. **Bayes' Rule**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

   Note: \( P(E) \) can be expanded as \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Let's assign plausible values:

- **Prior Probability**:
  - \( P(H) \): Let’s assume the prior probability that a random graduate student is studying computer science is reasonably high given the popularity of the field. We could use a value such as 0.2.

- **Likelihood**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam’s personality sketch fits given he is studying computer science. Typically, people in computer science can enjoy puzzles and often have high intelligence. However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals might be less common traits in the field. Let's estimate this probability as moderate, say 0.3.
  
  - \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he’s enrolled in any other field. Given his interest in nature, plants, and animals, it might indicate fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. These fields might align well with his traits, and thus this probability could be higher, let's estimate it as 0.8.

Now, let’s compute \( P(H|E) \):

    \[
    P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
    \]

    \[
    P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.8) = 0.06 + 0.64 = 0.70
    \]

    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.70} = \frac{0.06}{0.70} \approx 0.086
    \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch is approximately \( 0.086 \).
