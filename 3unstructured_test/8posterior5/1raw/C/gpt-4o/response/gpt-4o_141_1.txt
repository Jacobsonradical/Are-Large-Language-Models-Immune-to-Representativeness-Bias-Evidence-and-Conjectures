To infer the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on the given personality sketch, we need to estimate the prior probability of Adam being in computer science (P(H)), the likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits assuming he is in computer science (P(E|H)), and the likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits if he is not in computer science (P(E|\neg H)).

Hereâ€™s the process broken down:

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**:
   The probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science without additional information. Given the popularity of the field, let's say around 0.15 (15%).

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**:
   Given that Adam is in computer science, how likely is it that he would have the described personality traits? Adam's curiosity about nature, warmth, empathy, and love for animals are not directly related to computer science but his intelligence and problem-solving skills are aligned with the field. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.3 (30%).

3. **Likelihood of traits given non-enrollment in computer science (P(E|neg H))**:
   For fields outside of computer science, Adam's traits could fit into many areas like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc. Therefore, this likelihood could be higher. Let's estimate P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 (50%).

Now, using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
\]

\[
P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.3 \cdot 0.15 + 0.5 \cdot 0.85}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.425} = \frac{0.045}{0.47} \approx 0.096
\]

So, the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.096 (9.6%).
