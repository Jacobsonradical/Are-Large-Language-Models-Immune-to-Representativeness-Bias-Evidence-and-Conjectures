To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch (E), we will use Bayes' rule which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

Let's denote:
- \( H \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( \neg H \): Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

1. **Assessing \( P(H) \):**
   In general, graduate students can be enrolled in a variety of fields. Let's assume that there is a relatively equal distribution among various fields, but computer science is quite popular. We might reasonably estimate \( P(H) \) to be slightly higher than an equal probability due to the popularity of computer science. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

2. **Assessing \( P(E|H) \):**
   Given Adam's personality sketch, letâ€™s consider how likely someone in computer science would have those characteristics:
   - High intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science.
   - A genuine curiosity about nature and plants, warm-heartedness, empathy, and a love for animals are not typical but are certainly possible.
   
   Given these considerations, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be moderate. We might set \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \) (30%).

3. **Assessing \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   Now, considering the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were not in computer science:
   - His interests could also align well with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, where empathy and a love for animals might also be common.
   
   Based on that, let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \) to be slightly higher than \( P(E|H) \). We might set \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \) (40%).

4. **Calculating \( P(E) \):**
   Using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.3)(0.2) + (0.4)(0.8) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.32 \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.38 \] (38%)

Finally, we apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.3)(0.2)}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.38} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.158 \] (approximately 15.8%)

Now, summarizing the result in the required format:
