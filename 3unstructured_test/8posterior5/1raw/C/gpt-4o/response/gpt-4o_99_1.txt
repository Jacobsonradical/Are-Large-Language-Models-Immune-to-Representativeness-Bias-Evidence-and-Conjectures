To apply Bayes' Rule, we'll need to estimate the probabilities:

1. P(H) - The overall probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. P(E|H) - The probability of observing the personality sketch E, given that H (Adam was enrolled in computer science) is true.
3. P(E|¬H) - The probability of observing the personality sketch E, given that H is not true (he was not enrolled in computer science).

Let's consider each of these probabilities:

1. P(H) - The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. If we assume there's an equal chance that Adam could have been enrolled in any field, P(H) might roughly be 1 divided by the number of possible fields. For simplicity, let's assume there are around 10 major fields he could have studied. Thus, P(H) ≈ 0.1.

2. P(E|H) - The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch if he was enrolled in computer science. Given his qualities like high intelligence, curiosity, and enjoyment in solving puzzles, it's plausible these traits are found in computer science students. Let's estimate this to be relatively high, say 0.7.

3. P(E|¬H) - The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch if he was not enrolled in computer science. Similar traits could also be present in students from other fields like biology, psychology, etc. Hence, let's estimate this to be moderately high but slightly lower than P(E|H), say 0.5.

Now, we apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

Calculating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.07 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.52 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.52} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.52} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.135 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is roughly 0.135.
