To compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we'll proceed as follows:

Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing personality sketch E, derived from both possibilities.

Since \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \), we'll need to approximate these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):**
   Let's assume that there's a moderate chance that Adam, as a graduate student in the US, could be enrolled in computer science. For simplicity, we'll take \( P(H) \) to be 0.3.

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):**
   Considering the personality characteristics like solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, these traits align well with someone who might be studying computer science. We'll assign a high likelihood to this, let's say 0.6.

3. **Likelihood \(P(E|\neg H)\):**
   If Adam was not studying computer science, these traits could still be reasonably common in other fields, such as biology due to his interest in nature and empathy. Let's estimate this likelihood to be lower but not negligible, say 0.4.

Now, we need to calculate the overall probability of observing personality sketch \( E \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.18 + 0.28 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.46 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.46} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3913 \]

So, the probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.3913.
