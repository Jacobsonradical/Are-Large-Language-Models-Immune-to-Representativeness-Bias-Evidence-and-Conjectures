To use Bayesâ€™ rule to compute \( P(H|E) \), we need to consider prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)), likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)), and the probability of the evidence not under the hypothesis (\( P(E|\neg H) \)).

Let's define the terms:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.

1. **P(H) (Prior Probability)**:
   To estimate \( P(H) \), we consider the general probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science in the U.S. Let's assume about 20% of graduate students in the U.S. are enrolled in computer science programs:
   \[
   P(H) \approx 0.20
   \]

2. **P(E|H) (Likelihood)**:
   Considering Adam's traits (high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts), they align well with a computer science field. These traits may be less specific, but they do not contradict those usually seen in computer science students. Let's give this a reasonably high probability:
   \[
   P(E|H) \approx 0.70
   \]

3. **P(E|\neg H) (Probability of the Evidence Not Under the Hypothesis)**:
   These traits can also align with other graduate fields (e.g., biology, psychology). Hence, we should assume that these traits are not exclusive to computer science students. Let's consider this probability reasonable as many other fields could also involve students with such traits:
   \[
   P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.50
   \]

Now, let's apply Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where \( P(E) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
So:
\[
P(E) = (0.70 \cdot 0.20) + (0.50 \cdot 0.80) = 0.14 + 0.40 = 0.54
\]

Finally, computing \( P(H|E) \):
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.20}{0.54} = \frac{0.14}{0.54} \approx 0.259
\]

Therefore, the probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately:
