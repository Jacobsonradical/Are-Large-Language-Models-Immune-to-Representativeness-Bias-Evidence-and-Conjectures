Sure, let's break down the calculations for \( P(H), P(E|H), \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \) first.

- **P(H):** The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume the probability of any given graduate student being in computer science is around \(0.1\), based on general enrollment statistics.

- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he was in computer science. Adam's traits include curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and intelligence. While computer science students are often highly intelligent and good at solving abstract problems, the others are not specifically aligned. Let's assume this probability is \(0.4\).

- **P(E|\neg H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality if he was NOT in computer science, considering that other fields like biology or environmental science might more closely align with his interests and traits. Let's assume this value to be \(0.6\).

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Therefore,
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9) = 0.04 + 0.54 = 0.58 \]

Now, calculating the posterior probability:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.58} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.58} \approx 0.069 \]

Putting it all together in the specified format:
