To assess the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in "computer science" based on his personality traits and other given information, we need to evaluate the probabilities P(H), P(E|H), and P(E|¬H).

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Without further context, we might assume an equal distribution across many fields. For simplicity, let's assume there are 10 equally likely fields, so P(H) = 0.1.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in computer science. A student in computer science might show curiosity about nature and abstract concepts. However, intense empathy and a deep love for animals are not typically central to the profile. This might be moderately probable. Let's estimate this as 0.4.

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is not enrolled in computer science. Given the traits listed (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals), these might more commonly align with fields like biology, environmental sciences, or psychology. Let's estimate this as 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule, we compute P(H|E):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's traits, which can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) 
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.04 + 0.54 = 0.58
\]

Now applying Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.58} = \frac{0.04}{0.58} \approx 0.069
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is approximately 0.069.
