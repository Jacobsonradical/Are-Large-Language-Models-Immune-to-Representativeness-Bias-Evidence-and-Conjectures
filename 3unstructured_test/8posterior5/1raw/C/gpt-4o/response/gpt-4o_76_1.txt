To determine the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science (H) given his personality sketch (E), we need to consider:

1. P(H): The prior probability that he was enrolled in computer science.
2. P(E|H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
3. P(E|¬H): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science.

We'll need to make reasonable estimates for these probabilities, as exact values are not provided.

- P(H): Let's estimate the prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science. Considering the diversity of fields, a rough estimate could be around 0.2 (20%).

- P(E|H): Considering his qualities such as high intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving skills, these attributes align reasonably well with computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature make him less typical for this field. Let's estimate this probability at 0.4.

- P(E|¬H): For fields other than computer science, qualities such as strong empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work might be more common. Let's estimate this probability at 0.6.

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, given by:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.48 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.56 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.142857 \]

Hence, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.143 (rounded to three decimal places).
