To solve this problem using Bayes' rule and give an estimate, we need to assess the probability values and then compute the posterior probability. Here’s how we can approach it:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Since we don't have specific data on the overall distribution of fields for graduate students, we'll assume a relatively uniform distribution across fields. Let's assume P(H) = 0.1 (10%), acknowledging that computer science is a fairly common field.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics (nature curiosity, puzzle solving, empathy, love for animals, understanding abstract concepts) given that he is in computer science. Given the affinity for solving puzzles and high intelligence, it's reasonable to assume a moderately high probability. Let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.3 (30%).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he is not in computer science. This is more challenging since his traits could also align with other fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Let's set this value to be somewhat lower, given the specific mix of interests and traits. We'll estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' rule, we can find the posterior probability:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, which can be computed using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

First, compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.21 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.21} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.21} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1429 \]

Here is the answer in the required format:
