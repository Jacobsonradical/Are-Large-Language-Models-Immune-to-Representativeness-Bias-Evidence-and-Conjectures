To calculate the probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to first estimate \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E|\neg H) \).

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( E \) as the personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Estimate \( P(H) \):**
   This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
   For simplicity, let's assume there's an equal distribution of students across various fields in graduate school. However, given the prevalence of certain fields like computer science, we might assume a slightly higher prior probability. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \):**
   This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
   Considering Adam's traits like high intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts, this fits well with the field of computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for nature and animals might be less typical. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. **Estimate \( P(E|\neg H) \):**
   This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is not enrolled in computer science.
   Given his traits, he might fit well in fields such as biology, psychology, or environmental science. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Now, we can compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.08 + 0.24 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.32 \]

Finally, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.32} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is 0.25.
