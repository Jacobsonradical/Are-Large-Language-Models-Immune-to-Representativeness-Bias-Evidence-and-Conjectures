To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate the relevant probabilities:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch (E) given that he was enrolled in computer science.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was not enrolled in computer science.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \).

Here are the detailed steps:

1. **P(H)**: Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science is around 0.15 (or 15%). This is an estimated average value based on typical enrollment figures for various fields.

2. **P(E|H)**: Personality traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work might not be strongly correlated with the typical personality associated with a computer science student. However, his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are common among computer science students. Let's estimate this probability to be 0.25 (or 25%).

3. **P(E|¬H)**: There's a broader range of fields where Adam's traits could be more fitting, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology, etc. Given that any of these could potentially better match his personality sketch, let's estimate this probability to be higher, around 0.7 (or 70%).

Now we compute:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ = 0.25 \cdot 0.15 + 0.7 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ = 0.0375 + 0.595 \]
\[ = 0.6325 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.15}{0.6325} \]
\[ = \frac{0.0375}{0.6325} \]
\[ \approx 0.0592 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0592 (or around 5.92%).
