To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions for these probabilities:

### Estimations:
- **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
  - Given that computer science is a common field for graduate study in the U.S., we might assume a rough prior probability. Let's say 10% (or 0.1) of graduate students are enrolled in computer science programs.
  - \(P(H) = 0.1\)

- **Conditional Probability \(P(E|H)\)**:
  - Adam's traits of high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are consistent with qualities needed in computer science. However, his deep love for nature, animals, and empathy might not be directly related to computer science. Let's estimate this probability to be moderate.
  - \(P(E|H) = 0.2\)

- **Conditional Probability \(P(E|\neg H)\)**:
  - Given his personality sketch, other fields (like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc.) might be more likely for Adam. So, the probability of observing his personality sketch if he is not in computer science might be higher. Let's estimate this to be higher than \(P(E|H)\).
  - \(P(E|\neg H) = 0.6\)

### Bayes' Rule Calculation:
Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.1) + (0.6 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.54 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.56 \]

Then, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.56} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0357 \]

Expressing this as a value between 0 and 1:
