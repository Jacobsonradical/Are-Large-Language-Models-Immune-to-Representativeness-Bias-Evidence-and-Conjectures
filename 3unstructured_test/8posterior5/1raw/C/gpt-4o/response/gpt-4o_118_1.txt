Sure, let's go through the calculations step-by-step using Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the field of computer science, we need to make some hypotheses on the probabilities:

1. **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
2. **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch (E) given that he is enrolled in computer science.
3. **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch (E) given that he is not enrolled in computer science.

Let's analyze each term:

1. **P(H):** This is the prior probability that Adam was studying computer science. In the absence of specific data, we might use a general estimation based on common fields of graduate study. Let's assume a relatively moderate prior, say \(0.15\) (or 15%).

2. **P(E|H):** To determine this, we consider how likely Adam’s traits are if he were studying computer science. Traits like high intelligence and good problem-solving skills are typical in this field, so we might assign a higher value, say \(0.7\).

3. **P(E|¬H):** This is the probability of observing Adam’s traits if he were NOT in computer science. Given that these traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.) could also match students in fields like biology or environmental science, let's assess a moderate value, say \(0.4\).

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Where \( P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 \).

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.15) + (0.4 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.105 + 0.34 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.445 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{0.445} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.105}{0.445} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.236 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality traits is approximately 0.236.

Here's the formatted answer:
