To compute the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch.

Let’s hypothesize values for these probabilities. Without specific data, we can make informed estimates:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in computer science. Given that computer science is a very popular field, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.20 \).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam, if he were in computer science, would have the described personality traits. Given that computer science students often possess high intelligence and problem-solving skills, but not necessarily all traits, let’s estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.10 \).
3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability of possessing these personality traits if not enrolled in computer science. Since these traits could fit well with natural sciences, biology, etc., we might estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.05 \).

Using these values, we can compute:

- \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing the personality sketch can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.10 \cdot 0.20) + (0.05 \cdot 0.80) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.04 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 \]

- Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{0.06} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac(0.02}{0.06} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.33 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.33.
