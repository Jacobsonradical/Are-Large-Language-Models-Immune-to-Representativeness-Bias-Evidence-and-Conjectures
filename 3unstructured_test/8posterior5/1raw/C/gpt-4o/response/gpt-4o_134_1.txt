To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's how we evaluate each term:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) is observed if he is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) is observed if he is not enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) regardless of his field. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Now let's assign reasonable values:
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science is around 0.1. Computer science is a popular field, but not overwhelming in prevalence.
  
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he’s a computer science student. Since Adam has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts, and given that computer science often attracts people with these traits, let's assume a moderately high value of 0.5.

- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he’s not a computer science student. Many fields could still involve puzzle-solving, intelligence, and empathy, so let's assign a value of 0.2 for this complementary probability.

Given these values:
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.9 \)

We calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.9 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.23} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.217 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.217.
