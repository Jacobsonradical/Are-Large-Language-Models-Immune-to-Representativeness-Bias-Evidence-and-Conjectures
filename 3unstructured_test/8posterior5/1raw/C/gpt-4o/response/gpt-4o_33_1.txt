Sure, let's break this task down step by step to apply Bayes' rule for the given scenario.

**Bayes' Rule**:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( H \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( \neg H \): Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

To apply Bayes' Rule, we need to estimate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam has the described personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that Adam has the described personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in computer science.

**Estimates**:

1. \( P(H) \): This is the probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume approximately 20% of graduate students are enrolled in computer science.

\[ P(H) \approx 0.20 \]

2. \( P(E|H) \): This is the probability that a computer science student has the described personality traits. Computer science students can be curious, intelligent, and enjoy puzzles, but may not inherently have strong empathy or a deep love for animals and nature. Letâ€™s estimate this probability to be moderate.

\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.30 \]

3. \( P(E|\neg H) \): This is the probability that a non-computer science student has the described personality traits. Students in fields such as biology or environmental sciences might fit this description very well. Let's assume a somewhat higher probability for this estimate compared to computer science.

\[ P(E|\neg H) \approx 0.50 \]

To find \( P(E) \) (the total probability of E), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Where:

\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \approx 0.80 \]

Thus:

\[
P(E) = (0.30 \times 0.20) + (0.50 \times 0.80) \approx 0.06 + 0.40 = 0.46
\]

Finally, we can apply Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.30 \times 0.20}{0.46} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.46} \approx 0.13
\]

Therefore:
