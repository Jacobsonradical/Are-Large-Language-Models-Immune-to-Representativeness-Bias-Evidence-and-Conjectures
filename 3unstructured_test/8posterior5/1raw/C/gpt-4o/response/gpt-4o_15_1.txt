Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and the necessary calculations using Bayes' rule, here is the answer in the required format:

```json
{ 
  "computer science": "0.2"
}
```

To give you context, here is an explanation of the reasoning and computations involved:

1. **P(H) - Prior Probability:** This is the probability that any randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in the computer science field. Let's assume P(H) = 0.1 (10%), based on the popularity of computer science fields among graduate students.

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood:** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in computer science. Since Adam's traits such as intelligence and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science students, let's estimate P(E|H) = 0.5 (50%).

3. **P(E|¬H) - Likelihood of E given not H:** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is not in computer science. Given Adam's traits are broad and can apply to many fields, let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.1 (10%).

4. **P(¬H) - Probability of not H:** This is simply 1 - P(H). Therefore, P(¬H) = 0.9 (90%).

5. **Using Bayes' Rule:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.1) + (0.1 \cdot 0.9) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 + 0.09 = 0.14 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.14} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.05 / 0.14 ≈ 0.36 \]

Thus, the correct value should be:
```json
{ 
  "computer science": "0.36"
}
```

This is the corrected Bayesian probability that Adam is a computer science student given his personality traits and related assumptions.
