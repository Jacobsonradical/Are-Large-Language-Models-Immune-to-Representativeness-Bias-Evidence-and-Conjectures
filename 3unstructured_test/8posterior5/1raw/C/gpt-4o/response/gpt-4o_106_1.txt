To determine \( P(H|E) \) through Bayes' Rule, we can use the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's define and estimate the probabilities for the hypothesis \( H \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on the given personality sketch \( E \).

1. **\( P(H) \) (The prior probability that Adam is a computer science student):**
   - While there is no specific statistical data provided in the question, we will assume the probability of a graduate student being in computer science is moderately common. Let's estimate \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is a computer science student):**
   - Given that Adam is intelligent, good at abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles, and has a strong appreciation for hard work, these characteristics are somewhat consistent with typical traits of computer science students, but not uniquely so. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. **\( P(E|\neg H) \) (The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is not a computer science student):**
   - These traits are fairly common in many fields, not just computer science. Hence, the probability \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be slightly lower but still significant. Let's estimate \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.1 \).

4. **\( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) \):**
   - Therefore, \( P(\neg H) = 0.8 \).

Now, applying these values to Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{(0.4 \times 0.2) + (0.1 \times 0.8)} \]

Calculating the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.16} = 0.5 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch is:
