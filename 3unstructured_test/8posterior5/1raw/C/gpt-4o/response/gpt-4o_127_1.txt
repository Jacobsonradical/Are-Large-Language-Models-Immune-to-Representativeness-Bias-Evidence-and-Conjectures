Firstly, let's denote:

- H as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science.
- E as the evidence given by the personality sketch of Adam.

We need to estimate the following probabilities:
1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. P(E|H): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. P(E|¬H): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.

Let's assume:
- P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Since computer science is a common field among graduate students, we can estimate this to be relatively high. Let's assume P(H) = 0.3.
- P(E|H): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Adam's traits such as intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts are somewhat aligned with computer science. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.7.
- P(E|¬H): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science. These traits can also be present in students of other fields, but perhaps somewhat less so. Let's assume P(E|¬H) = 0.4.

By Bayes' rule, we have:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) \]
\[ P(¬H) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 \]

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.3) + (0.4 \cdot 0.7) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.21 + 0.28 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.49 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.49} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.49} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.4286 \]
