To use Bayes' rule, we need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) given the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). 

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's how we estimate each of the required probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science, independent of his personality sketch. Since graduate students enroll in a wide variety of fields, and assuming no other prior information, we can start with a neutral prior probability. Let’s assume there’s an equal likelihood across various graduate fields. If we consider, say, 10 possible fields, then \( P(H) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science. Given the sketch, Adam’s traits such as high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, are highly compatible with computer science. Therefore, this probability can be assumed to be relatively high, say \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **Probability of Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch across all fields. Given his traits, they might be relatively common among graduate students but not exclusive to any one field. Thus, let’s assume \( P(E) = 0.2 \).

4. **Alternative Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in computer science. If we assume high intelligence and puzzle-solving ability traits are somewhat less frequent in other fields, we might give it a moderate probability, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.3 \).

Using these values, we can now apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.07}{0.2} = 0.35 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is 0.35, or 35%.
