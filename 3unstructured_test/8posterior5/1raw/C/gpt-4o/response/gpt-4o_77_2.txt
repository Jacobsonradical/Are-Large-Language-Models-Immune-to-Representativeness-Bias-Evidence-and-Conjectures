Given the problem, let's break down each probability and then apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|E) \).

- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science. This is a subjective estimate, but given that computer science is a popular field in the U.S., let's assume a prior probability of 0.2 (20%).

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in computer science. Considering that computer science students often have high intelligence, enjoy solving puzzles, and appreciate hard work, but may not typically have strong empathy, a deep love for animals, or a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, letâ€™s estimate this at 0.3 (30%).

- **\( P(E|\neg H) \)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is not in computer science. Fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology could better align with Adam's personality traits. This suggests \( P(E|\neg H) \) might be relatively higher, let's estimate it at 0.6 (60%).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \).

\[ 
P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.6 \times 0.8)
\]

\[ 
P(E) = 0.06 + 0.48
\]

\[ 
P(E) = 0.54
\]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.54}
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.54}
\]

\[ 
P(H|E) \approx 0.111
\]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.111.
