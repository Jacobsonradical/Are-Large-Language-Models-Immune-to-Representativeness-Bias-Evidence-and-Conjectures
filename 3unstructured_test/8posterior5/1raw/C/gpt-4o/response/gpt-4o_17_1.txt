To solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, we need to evaluate the following probabilities:

1. P(H): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. P(E|H): The likelihood of the personality sketch E given Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. P(E|\neg H): The likelihood of the personality sketch E given Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
4. P(H|E): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch E.

Let's assume reasonable values for these probabilities based on the personality traits described:

1. **P(H): Prior probability**  
   Given that Adam is a graduate student in the U.S., let's assume there's a balanced distribution of different fields students may be enrolled in. For simplicity, we might assume the prior probability that Adam is in computer science is 0.2 (20%).

2. **P(E|H): Likelihood of E given H**  
   While computer science students can have varied personalities, including empathy and love for animals, Adam's personality sketch seems more aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. If a computer science student had this exact personality trait, it might be less likely. Let's assign P(E|H) = 0.1 (10%).

3. **P(E|\neg H): Likelihood of E given not H**  
   Since Adam's traits appear more aligned with fields studying nature, plants, and animals, the probability of having this personality in those fields might be higher. We can estimate P(E|\neg H) = 0.5 (50%).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where:
\[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)\]

\[\neg H\] is the event that Adam is not in computer science, so \[P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8\].

\[P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times 0.8)\]
\[P(E) = 0.02 + 0.4\]
\[P(E) = 0.42\]

Finally, calculating the posterior probability:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.42}\]
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.42}\]
\[P(H|E) \approx 0.0476\]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.0476.
