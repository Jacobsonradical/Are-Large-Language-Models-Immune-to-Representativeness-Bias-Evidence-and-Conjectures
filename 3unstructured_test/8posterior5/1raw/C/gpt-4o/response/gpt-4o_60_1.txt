To estimate the probabilities, let's break down each prior and conditional probability involved:

- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in a computer science program. Without any specific statistical data, we can assume a baseline. Graduate programs in computer science are quite popular, but not overwhelmingly so compared to all available fields. Let’s assign a moderate prior probability, say 0.15.

- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch E given the hypothesis H that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given that Adam has high intelligence, good at solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, these are traits commonly associated with computer science students. Let’s assign a relatively high probability, say 0.6.

- **P(E|¬H):** The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science. Traits of curiosity, intelligence, empathy, and appreciation for hard work can fit many other fields as well (like biology, psychology, etc.). So, this probability should be fairly high but not as high as P(E|H). Let’s assign it, say 0.4.

Now, let’s calculate the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Given our assigned values:
\[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.6 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.4 \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 \]

Substituting these into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{0.6 \cdot 0.15 + 0.4 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.34} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.43} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.209 \]

So, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is approximately 0.209.

Therefore, we can represent our answer in the required format:
