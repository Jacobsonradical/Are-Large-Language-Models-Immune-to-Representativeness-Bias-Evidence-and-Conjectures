To find the probability P(H|E) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch), we'll start by evaluating the prior probability (P(H)), the likelihood (P(E|H)), and the likelihood given the negation (P(E|¬H)). We will use Bayes' rule to combine these probabilities.

### Steps:

1. **P(H) - Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science**:
   - Since we are not given specific data about enrollment probabilities across all fields, let’s assume a simplified model. Suppose there are many possible fields Adam could be enrolled in, and computer science is one among them. Given the popularity of computer science in recent years, let's assign P(H) a reasonable non-specific prior value, such as 0.1.

2. **P(E|H) - Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science**:
   - Adam's characteristics include understanding abstract concepts and high intelligence, which are beneficial for a field like computer science. These traits may be consistent with someone in this field. Therefore, let’s assign P(E|H) a value of 0.6.

3. **P(E|¬H) - Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is not enrolled in computer science**:
   - Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart might suggest equally likely aptitudes for fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science. These traits are not exclusive to, nor do they strongly suggest, a computer science background, but they do align well with many possible fields. So, P(E|¬H) might be slightly less than P(E|H). We could set this as 0.4.

### Using Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of E, given by:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{(0.6 \cdot 0.1) + (0.4 \cdot 0.9)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.36} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.42} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.143 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.143.
