To judge the probabilities, we need to make some reasonable estimations based on the provided information.

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
Since computer science is a common field for graduate students, let's assume a moderate prior probability. We'll estimate P(H) = 0.2.

2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
Given Adam's curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, and high intelligence, there are some characteristics that align with computer science, particularly problem-solving skills. However, his strong love for animals and nature, and empathy may not be particularly aligned with the stereotype of a computer science student. Thus, we'll estimate P(E|H) = 0.2.

3. **P(E|\neg H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was not enrolled in computer science.
Given that Adam's personality and interests align well with biology, environmental science, or psychology, we'll estimate P(E|Â¬H) = 0.8.

Now, we use Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing E:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.2) + (0.8 \times 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.04 + 0.64 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.68 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.68} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.68} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.0588 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch is approximately 0.0588.
