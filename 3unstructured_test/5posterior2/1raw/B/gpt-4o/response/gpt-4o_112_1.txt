  "business administration": 0.1
}

Adam's personality sketch indicates that he has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, and has strong empathy and a love for animals. These traits suggest a propensity for fields like environmental science, biology, or even psychology rather than business administration. Additionally, his appreciation for hard work and dedication can be applicable in many fields, but his specific interests do not align closely with the typical traits of someone who would enroll in business administration. Therefore, the probability that he was enrolled in business administration, given his personality sketch, is relatively low.
