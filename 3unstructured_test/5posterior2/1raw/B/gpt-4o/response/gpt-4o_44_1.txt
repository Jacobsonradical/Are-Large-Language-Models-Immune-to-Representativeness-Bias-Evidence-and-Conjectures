Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems more likely that he would be drawn to fields related to nature, biology, environmental science, or something similarly connected to his interest in plants, animals, and abstract concepts. While business administration could potentially involve a variety of interests, it typically does not align as closely with the described traits of strong empathy, a love for animals, and a quiet disposition focused on solving puzzles. Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration seems lower compared to other, more aligned fields.
