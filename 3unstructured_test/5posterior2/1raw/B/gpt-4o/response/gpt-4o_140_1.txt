  "business administration": 0.2
}

While Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and understanding of abstract concepts could certainly be assets in a business administration program, his deeper interests such as a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a stronger alignment with fields related to environmental science, biology, or psychology. This makes it somewhat less likely, although not impossible, that he would have chosen business administration. Thus, a lower probability estimate of around 0.2 seems reasonable given the provided information.
