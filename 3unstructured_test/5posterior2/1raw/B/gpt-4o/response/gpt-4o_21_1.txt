Given Adam's personality traits and interests, such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, it's less likely that he would be enrolled in a field like business administration, which typically focuses more on corporate management, economics, and financial principles. However, it can't be completely ruled out, as business administration can intersect with various sectors, including non-profits or environmental organizations which might appeal to his empathic and dedicated nature. Thus, while the probability is not high, it is not zero.
