}

Explanation: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest that he might be more inclined towards fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration. Additionally, his interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts might lean him towards more scientific or research-oriented disciplines. While it's possible for someone with his personality traits to be in business administration, it seems less likely given the information provided, hence the lower probability.
