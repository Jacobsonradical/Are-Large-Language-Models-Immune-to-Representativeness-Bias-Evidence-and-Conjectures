Given Adam's personality traits—such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a strong empathy and love for animals, and a quiet nature with a love for solving puzzles—it seems less likely that he would gravitate towards a field like business administration. This field generally demands a different set of interests and skills, such as a focus on finance, management, and economics, which do not align closely with Adam's apparent inclinations towards nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving. However, it's not entirely impossible; there are ways in which his empathy and appreciation for hard work could be relevant in a business context. Hence, the probability is not exceedingly low but not high either.
