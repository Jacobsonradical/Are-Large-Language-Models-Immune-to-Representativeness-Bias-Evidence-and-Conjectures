  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, which emphasizes his natural curiosity, love for nature and animals, quiet demeanor, and aptitude for solving puzzles and abstract concepts, it seems more likely he would be drawn to fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology over business administration. While his understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant in business administration, his other traits suggest a stronger leaning towards scientific or research-oriented fields. Therefore, I've estimated a lower posterior probability for business administration.
