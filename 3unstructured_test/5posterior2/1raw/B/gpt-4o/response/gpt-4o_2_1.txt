Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a field like business administration. His strong curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology. Business administration typically attracts individuals who are more oriented towards management, finance, and organizational skills rather than the natural world and animals. Therefore, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is estimated to be relatively low.
