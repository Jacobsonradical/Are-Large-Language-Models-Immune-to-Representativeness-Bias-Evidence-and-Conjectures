  "business administration": 0.2
}

The reason behind this estimate is that while Adam's attributes of high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be valuable in business administration, his strong interest in nature, plants, solving puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts doesn't strongly align with the typical interests or personality traits one might expect from someone pursuing a degree in business administration. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.
