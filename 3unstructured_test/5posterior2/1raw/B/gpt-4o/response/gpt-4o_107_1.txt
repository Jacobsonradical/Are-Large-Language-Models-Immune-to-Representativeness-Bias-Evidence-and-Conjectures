  "business administration": 0.2

Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood of him being in a field like business administration seems relatively lower. His deep love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles suggests a stronger inclination towards fields that require an appreciation for the natural world and scientific thinking. However, his intelligence and understanding of the importance of hard work and dedication might still give him a small probability of being in business administration, potentially focusing on areas such as environmental management or corporate social responsibility, which connect with his interests.
