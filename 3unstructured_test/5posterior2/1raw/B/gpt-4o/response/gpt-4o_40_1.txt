  "business administration": 0.2
}

Given Adam's primary interests and personality traits—such as his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and strong empathy—it's less likely he would have chosen a field like business administration, which is typically more focused on management, economics, and organizational aspects. However, it's not entirely impossible, especially if he is seeking to apply his high intelligence and abstract reasoning skills to the business side of a field related to his interests (e.g., agricultural business). Therefore, a conditional probability of 0.2 reflects a lower likelihood but not an improbable scenario.
