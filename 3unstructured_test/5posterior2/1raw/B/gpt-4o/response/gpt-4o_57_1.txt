  "business administration": 0.2
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a field like business administration, which is typically associated with interests in commerce, management, and economics rather than a deep curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an inclination towards solving puzzles and abstract concepts. However, it is not impossible, so a value of around 0.2 seems reasonable.
