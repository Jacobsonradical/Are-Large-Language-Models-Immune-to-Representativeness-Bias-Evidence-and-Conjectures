  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation: Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems more inclined towards fields that involve nature, animals, and abstract thinking rather than business administration. His strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest he might be more interested in disciplines like environmental science, biology, or psychology. Business administration typically requires different traits, such as a strong interest in leadership, finance, and organizational strategy, which are not highlighted in the provided sketch. Thus, the probability is relatively low.
