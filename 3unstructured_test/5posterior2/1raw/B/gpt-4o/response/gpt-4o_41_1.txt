Although Adam's personality traits, such as high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and strong problem-solving skills, could be beneficial in business administration, his deep curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest that he might be more inclined toward a field related to environmental science, biology, or psychology. Therefore, the probability that he is enrolled in business administration is relatively low, but not zero, as those skills and traits are still valuable in a business context.
