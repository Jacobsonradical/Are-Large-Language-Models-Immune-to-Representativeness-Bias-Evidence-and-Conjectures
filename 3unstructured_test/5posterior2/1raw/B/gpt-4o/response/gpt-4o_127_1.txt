Given Adam's personality sketch, it's reasonable to infer that his genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals would typically attract him to more science or nature-related fields. His high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and ability to understand abstract concepts would certainly equip him well for various fields, including business administration. However, his interests and personality traits seem to align more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology, thus making the probability relatively low but not negligible.
