Given Adam's personality sketch, his characteristics and interests seem to align more closely with fields involved with nature, animals, or abstract problem-solving. Business administration typically requires interest in corporate management, finance, and organizational operations, which do not align as strongly with his described passions and strengths. Hence, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality traits is estimated to be relatively low.
