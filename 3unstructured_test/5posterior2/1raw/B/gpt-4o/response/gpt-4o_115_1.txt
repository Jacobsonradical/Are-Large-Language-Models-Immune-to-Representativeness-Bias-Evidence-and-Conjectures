  "business administration": "0.1"

Given Adam's personality sketch, it's unlikely that he'd be enrolled in business administration. His interests in nature, solving puzzles, empathy, and love for animals suggest he might be more inclined towards fields related to the biological sciences, environmental studies, or psychology. These interests and traits do not typically align closely with the focus and skills emphasized in business administration. Thus, the posterior conditional probability is estimated to be low.
