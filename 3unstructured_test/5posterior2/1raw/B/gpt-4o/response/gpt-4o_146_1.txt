  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a business administration program. His genuine curiosity about nature, enjoyment of puzzles, strong empathy, and love for animals are traits more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or other natural sciences rather than business administration. Therefore, while it's still possible, the probability would reasonably be on the lower side.
