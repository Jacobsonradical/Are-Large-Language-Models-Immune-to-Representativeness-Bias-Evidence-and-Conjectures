  "business administration": 0.1
}

Adam's personality sketch suggests someone who is more likely to be interested in fields related to nature, puzzles, and animals. These interests and traits seem less aligned with business administration, which typically requires a strong focus on management, finance, and leadership skills that may not be as closely tied to Adam's described passions and strengths. Therefore, the probability is relatively low but not impossible, as his high intelligence and understanding of hard work could allow him to adapt to various fields.
