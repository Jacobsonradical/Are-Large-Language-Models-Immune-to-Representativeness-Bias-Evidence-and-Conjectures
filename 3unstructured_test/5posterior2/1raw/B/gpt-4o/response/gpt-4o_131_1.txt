Adam's personality traits such as his curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and intelligence in abstract concepts are more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or possibly psychology. Business administration typically requires a different set of interests and skills focused more on management, finance, and economic strategy, which do not strongly correspond with Adam's described traits.
