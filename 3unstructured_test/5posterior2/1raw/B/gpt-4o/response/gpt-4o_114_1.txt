  "business administration": 0.2

Adam's personality traits suggest a strong interest in nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which are not typically aligned with the interests and skills often associated with Business Administration. Business Administration programs commonly attract individuals with interests in management, finance, entrepreneurship, and organizational leadership. Given Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work, there's some possibility he could be in that field, but his interests more strongly suggest a different area of study. Therefore, the estimated probability is relatively low.
