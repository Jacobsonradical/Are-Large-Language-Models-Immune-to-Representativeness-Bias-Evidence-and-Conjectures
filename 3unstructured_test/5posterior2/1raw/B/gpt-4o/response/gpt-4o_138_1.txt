Explanation: Based on Adam's personality sketch which highlights his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment in solving puzzles, it seems more likely that he would pursue a field related to natural sciences, environmental studies, or similar areas rather than business administration. While high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts can be beneficial in business, his specific interests and empathetic nature suggest that a career in business administration is less probable. Hence, a posterior conditional probability of 0.1 seems appropriate.
