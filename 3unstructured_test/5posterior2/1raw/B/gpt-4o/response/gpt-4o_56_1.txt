Based on Adam's personality sketch, his strong empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and enjoyment of solving puzzles seem less aligned with typical interests and attributes of a business administration student. Although his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could support a wide range of fields, the specific traits mentioned suggest a stronger inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or other sciences. Therefore, the probability that he was enrolled in business administration is relatively low.
