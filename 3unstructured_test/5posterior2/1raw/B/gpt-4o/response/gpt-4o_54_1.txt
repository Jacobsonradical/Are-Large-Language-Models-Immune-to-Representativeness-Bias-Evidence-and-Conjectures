  "business administration": 0.15
}

Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles, it seems less likely that he would pursue a field like business administration, which typically involves more focus on management, finance, and operations rather than deep, nature-related or cognitive inquiries. Nonetheless, it's not entirely improbable, as individuals can have diverse interests. Therefore, the probability is relatively low but not zero.
