  "business administration": 0.2

Given Adam's personality sketch, it sounds like he might be more interested in fields related to nature, animals, science, or problem-solving rather than business administration. However, it's not impossible for someone with his characteristics to be enrolled in business administration, especially if that department offers specializations related to environmental sustainability, non-profit management, or other areas that align with his interests. Therefore, the estimate is relatively low but not zero.
