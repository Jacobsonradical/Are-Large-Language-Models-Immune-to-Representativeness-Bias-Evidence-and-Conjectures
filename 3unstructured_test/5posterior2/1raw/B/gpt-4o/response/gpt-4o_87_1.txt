Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and strong empathy, it seems less likely that he would be drawn to the field of business administration, which often focuses more on management, finance, and organizational tasks. His high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit various fields, but his specific interests in nature and animals suggest he might be more likely to pursue a field related to biology, environmental science, or a similar discipline. Therefore, the probability that he was enrolled in business administration is relatively low.
