  "business administration": 0.2

Adam's interests and personality traits, such as his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, suggest a strong inclination toward fields related to the environment, science, or perhaps more personal and empathetic areas of study. While business administration requires intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, it may not align as closely with Adam's apparent inclinations and passions. Therefore, the probability is relatively low but not zero, considering the versatility of people and their potential varied interests.
