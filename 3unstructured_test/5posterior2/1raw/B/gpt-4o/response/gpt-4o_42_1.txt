  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given the personality traits described for Adam (genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and enjoyment of solving puzzles), it seems less likely that he would choose a field like business administration. His interests and skills align more closely with fields related to biology, environmental science, or possibly even psychology. The abstract problem-solving aspect and empathy might suggest something in the realm of social sciences or STEM fields, but business administration doesn't directly align with the traits described. Thus, I estimate the probability as low.
