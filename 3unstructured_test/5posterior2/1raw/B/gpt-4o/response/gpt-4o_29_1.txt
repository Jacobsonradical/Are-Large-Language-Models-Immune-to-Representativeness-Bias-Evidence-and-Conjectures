  "business administration": 0.1

Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have a strong inclination towards nature, animals, and intellectual endeavors such as solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. These traits are more commonly found in fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration. His described empathy and warmth might also suggest social sciences or professions tied to helping others. Overall, while it's not impossible for someone with these traits to pursue business administration, it seems less likely compared to other fields more aligned with his interests and personality. Therefore, the estimated probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration would be on the lower side, around 0.1.
