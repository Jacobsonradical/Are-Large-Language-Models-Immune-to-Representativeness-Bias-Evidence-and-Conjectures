  "business administration": 0.10
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood that he was enrolled in business administration seems relatively low. His genuine curiosity about nature, interest in solving puzzles, empathy, and love for animals suggest that he might be more inclined toward fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or other sciences rather than a business-oriented field. His strong appreciation for hard work and dedication does not specifically align with the typical motivations and interests of business administration students. Hence, a value of 0.10 seems reasonable.
