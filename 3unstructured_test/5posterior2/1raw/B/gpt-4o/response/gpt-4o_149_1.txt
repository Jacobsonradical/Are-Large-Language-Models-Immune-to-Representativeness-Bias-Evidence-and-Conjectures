Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment in solving puzzles, it suggests he might be more inclined towards fields related to science, nature, or intellectual inquiry rather than business administration. Additionally, his strong empathy and warm heart also indicate he may prefer fields with a humanitarian aspect. Hence, while it's not impossible for Adam to be in business administration, the probability seems relatively low compared to other fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology.
