  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's personality traits, interests, and empathy towards nature and animals, it seems more probable that he would be involved in fields related to environmental sciences, biology, or psychology rather than business administration. A 0.1 estimate reflects a lower likelihood while acknowledging the possibility that he could still have an interest or find value in the business administration field despite his predominant personality and interests.
