  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adamâ€™s personality sketch, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a field like business administration. His curiosity about nature, love for solving puzzles, and deep empathy for animals suggest he might be more inclined towards fields related to biology, environmental science, or possibly psychology. These interests and traits are less commonly associated with business administration. Therefore, while it's still possible, the probability is relatively low.
