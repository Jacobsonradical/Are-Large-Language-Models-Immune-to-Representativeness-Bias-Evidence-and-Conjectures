  "business administration": 0.2

Given Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and preference for solving puzzles, it seems more likely that he would pursue a field related to the natural sciences, environment, or something intellectually stimulating. Business administration typically attracts individuals interested in organizational management, finance, or entrepreneurship, which doesn’t appear to align closely with Adam’s interests and traits. Thus, the probability that he was enrolled in business administration is relatively low, though not impossible.
