  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles, business administration does not seem to align closely with his described characteristics and interests. These attributes are more commonly associated with fields such as biology, environmental science, or other sciences that involve natural observation and problem-solving. However, it is not entirely impossible for someone with Adam's traits to be in business administration, hence the low probability of 0.1.
