  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and high intelligence with a preference for abstract concepts, it seems less likely that he would be drawn to the field of business administration. These traits are more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or other disciplines that align closely with his interests and personality. Therefore, a lower probability is assigned to business administration.
