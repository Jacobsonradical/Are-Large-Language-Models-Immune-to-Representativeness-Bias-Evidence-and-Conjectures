Given Adam's personality sketch which highlights his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and interest in solving puzzles, it seems more likely that he would be drawn to fields related to environmental science, biology, or psychology rather than business administration. While it is not impossible that someone with these traits would be in business administration, the probability is relatively low compared to other fields that are more aligned with his interests and personality traits.
