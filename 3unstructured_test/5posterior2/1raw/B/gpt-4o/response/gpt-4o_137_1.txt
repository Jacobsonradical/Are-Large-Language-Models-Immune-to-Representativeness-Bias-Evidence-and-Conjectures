  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a business administration program. Instead, his interests and qualities suggest he might be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or something that involves working closely with nature and abstract concepts. While it's not entirely impossible for him to be in business administration, the probability seems relatively low based on the personality sketch provided.
