Adam's personality sketch highlights traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits are more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Business administration typically requires interest in commerce, management, and organizational processes, which are not emphasized in Adam's personality sketch. Therefore, the conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low, though not impossible.
