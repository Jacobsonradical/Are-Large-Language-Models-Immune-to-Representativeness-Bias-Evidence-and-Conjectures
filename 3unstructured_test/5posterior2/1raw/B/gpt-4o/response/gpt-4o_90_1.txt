  "business administration": 0.2
}

Given Adam's deep love for nature, animals, solving puzzles, and his empathy, it seems more likely that he would pursue a field more aligned with these interests, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. However, it's not impossible that someone with high intelligence and an understanding of hard work might find value in the strategic and analytical aspects of business administration. Thus, while the probability is not high, it is not zero either. A reasonable estimate is 0.2.
