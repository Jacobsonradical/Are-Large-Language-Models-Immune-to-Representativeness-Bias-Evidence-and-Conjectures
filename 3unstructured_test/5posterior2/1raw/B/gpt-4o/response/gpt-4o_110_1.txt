  "business administration": 0.2
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely that he would choose a field such as business administration. His strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles, combined with his empathy and love for animals, suggests he might be more inclined toward fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies. His appreciation for hard work and dedication might be a factor in other disciplines as well, but business administration does not align closely with the described attributes.
