  "business administration": 0.2

Given Adam's deep appreciation for nature, animals, empathy, puzzles, and his understanding of abstract concepts, it seems more likely he would gravitate toward fields more closely aligned with those interests, such as biology, environmental science, or perhaps even psychology. Business administration typically appeals to individuals with a strong interest in management, economics, and organizational behavior, which doesn't align as closely with Adamâ€™s described interests and personality. Thus, while it's not impossible that he would pursue business administration, the probability based on the given personality sketch seems relatively lower.
