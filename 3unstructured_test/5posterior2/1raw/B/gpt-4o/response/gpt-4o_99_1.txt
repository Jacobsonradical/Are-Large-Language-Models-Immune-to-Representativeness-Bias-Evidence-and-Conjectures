  "business administration": 0.2
}

Given Adam's deep love for nature, animals, empathy, and interest in abstract concepts, it seems less likely that he would choose a field like business administration, which is typically more focused on management, finance, and organizational behavior. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility, especially given his high intelligence and ability to appreciate hard work and dedication, which are also important in business administration. Therefore, a lower probability is reasonable, but not a zero chance.
