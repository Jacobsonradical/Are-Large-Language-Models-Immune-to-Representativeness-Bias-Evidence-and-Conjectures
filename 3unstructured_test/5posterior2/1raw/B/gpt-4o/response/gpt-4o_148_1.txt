  "business administration": 0.2
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, his interests and traits such as a deep love for animals, a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, strong empathy, and an inclination towards solving puzzles, align more closely with fields related to the natural sciences, environmental studies, or possibly psychology. While it's not impossible for someone with this personality to enroll in business administration, the probability seems lower compared to fields that more directly match his interests and personal attributes. Therefore, I provide a moderate but not high probability estimate of 0.2 for him being enrolled in business administration.
