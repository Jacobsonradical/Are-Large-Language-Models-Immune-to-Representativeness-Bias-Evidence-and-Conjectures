  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, intelligence, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is less likely that he was enrolled in a business administration program, which typically attracts individuals with a stronger focus on corporate, managerial, or economic aspects. His profile seems more aligned with fields like environmental science, biology, psychology, or another area with a focus on nature and abstract thinking. Thus, the estimated posterior probability for business administration is relatively low.
