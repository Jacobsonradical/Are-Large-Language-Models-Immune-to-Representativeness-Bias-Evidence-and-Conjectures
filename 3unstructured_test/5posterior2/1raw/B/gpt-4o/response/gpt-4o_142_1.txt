  "business administration": 0.2

Given Adam's personality sketch which highlights his curiosity about nature, appreciation for plants, love for animals, and intelligence in abstract concepts, it seems less likely that he'd be enrolled in a field like business administration. While his high intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication could be advantageous in any field, his specific interests in nature and animals suggest that he might be more inclined towards fields related to biology, environmental science, or zoology. Therefore, the probability of him being enrolled in business administration is relatively low.
