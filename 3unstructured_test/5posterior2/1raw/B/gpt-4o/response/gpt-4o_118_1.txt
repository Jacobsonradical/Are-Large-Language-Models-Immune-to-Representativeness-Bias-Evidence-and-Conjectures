Adam's personality and interests—curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work—are less typically aligned with a field like business administration, which often focuses more on managerial, economic, and strategic aspects of organizations. Adam's strengths in understanding abstract concepts might be relevant, but the overall fit with business administration seems less likely compared to fields more closely related to his interests, such as environmental science, biology, or psychology.
