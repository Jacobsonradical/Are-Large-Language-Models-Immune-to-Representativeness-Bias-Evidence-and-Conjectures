  "business administration": 0.2
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems more probable that he would be inclined toward fields related to nature, animals, or scientific inquiry rather than business administration. His strong empathy, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and curiosity about nature suggest he might be more suited for fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. However, there is still a possibility he could be enrolled in business administration, particularly if it pertains to sectors related to his interests (e.g., a business role in an environmental or animal-focused organization). Thus, an estimate of 0.2 reflects the lower probability compared to fields more directly aligned with his personality and interests.
