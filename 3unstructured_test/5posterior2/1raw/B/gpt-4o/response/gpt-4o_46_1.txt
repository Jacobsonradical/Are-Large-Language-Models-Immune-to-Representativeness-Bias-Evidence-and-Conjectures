  "business administration": 0.2
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, enjoyment of solving puzzles, empathy, and appreciation for hard work suggest that he may be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or even education. However, it's not impossible for someone with these traits to be in business administration, especially if they were pursuing a career in corporate social responsibility or environmental sustainability. Hence, a moderate but relatively low probability of 0.2 is assigned.
