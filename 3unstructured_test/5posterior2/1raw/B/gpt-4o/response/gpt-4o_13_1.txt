Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong inclination towards natural sciences or fields that involve working with animals and environmental studies. His empathy, love for nature, and intelligence in abstract concepts suggest he might be more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology. Business administration seems less likely given his described interests and characteristics, hence the estimated probability is low.
