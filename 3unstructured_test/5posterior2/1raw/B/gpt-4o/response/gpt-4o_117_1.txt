Given Adam's personality sketch, his interests and characteristics seem to align more closely with fields related to the natural sciences, animal science, biology, or related areas. Business administration typically requires skills in leadership, management, and often a strong interest in commerce and the corporate world, which does not seem to be highlighted in Adam's profile. Therefore, the probability that he was enrolled in business administration is relatively low.
