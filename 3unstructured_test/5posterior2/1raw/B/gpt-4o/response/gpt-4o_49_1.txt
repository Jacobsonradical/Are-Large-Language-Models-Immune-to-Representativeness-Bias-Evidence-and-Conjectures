  "business administration": 0.1

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and intelligence with abstract concepts, it is less likely that he would be enrolled in a field traditionally associated with business and its administrative aspects. Adam's personality traits and interests seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or any area that involves understanding complex systems and caring for living beings. Therefore, the probability that he was enrolled in business administration is relatively low.
