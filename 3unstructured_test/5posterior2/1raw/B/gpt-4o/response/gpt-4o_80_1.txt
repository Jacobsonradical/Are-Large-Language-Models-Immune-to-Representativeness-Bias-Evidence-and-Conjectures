  "business administration": 0.1

Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for the hard work and dedication, it seems more likely that he would be drawn to fields related to natural sciences, environmental studies, or perhaps even psychology due to his empathy and interest in understanding complex concepts. Business administration appears less likely compared to these other fields, hence the lower posterior conditional probability.
