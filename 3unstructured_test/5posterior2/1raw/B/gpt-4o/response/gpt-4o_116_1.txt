  "business administration": 0.2

Given Adam's personality sketch, his attributes such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and enjoyment in solving puzzles suggest a natural propensity towards fields related to science, environment, or perhaps psychology. While these traits do not inherently exclude business administration, they do not align as strongly with the character traits typically associated with someone who would choose a business administration path, such as a focus on leadership, management skills, and perhaps a more extroverted and strategic disposition. Therefore, the probability is relatively low, but not zero because people can have diverse interests and career paths.
