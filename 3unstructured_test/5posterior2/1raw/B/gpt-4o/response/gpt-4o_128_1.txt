  "business administration": 0.2
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam's strong curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work may align more closely with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are valuable in any field, but his personality traits seem less characteristic of someone pursuing business administration, hence the relatively low posterior conditional probability.
