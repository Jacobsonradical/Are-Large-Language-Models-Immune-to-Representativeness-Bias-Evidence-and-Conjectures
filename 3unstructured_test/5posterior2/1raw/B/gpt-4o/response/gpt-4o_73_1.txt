Sure, based on the personality sketch provided, here is the estimate for the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's strong interest in nature, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence in abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, he seems more inclined towards fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology rather than business administration.
