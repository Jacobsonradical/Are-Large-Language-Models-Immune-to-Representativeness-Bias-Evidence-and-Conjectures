Based on Adam's personality sketch, his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles suggest a leaning towards fields more related to science, research, or environmental studies rather than business administration. While it's not impossible for someone with these traits to be in business administration, it seems less likely given his described interests and empathetic nature.
