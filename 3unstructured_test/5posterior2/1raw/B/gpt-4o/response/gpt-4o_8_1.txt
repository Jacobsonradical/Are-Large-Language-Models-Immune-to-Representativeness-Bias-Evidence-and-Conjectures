Given Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles, it is more likely that he would be enrolled in a field related to biology, environmental science, or a similar discipline rather than business administration. However, there is still a possibility that he could be in business administration if his career goals involve aspects like managing wildlife reserves, non-profits related to animal welfare, or sustainability initiatives. Thus, the probability is estimated to be low but not negligible.
