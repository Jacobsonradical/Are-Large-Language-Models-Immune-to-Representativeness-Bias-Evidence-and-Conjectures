Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems more likely that he would pursue a field that aligns with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and intelligence in abstract concepts. Fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology seem more aligned with his interests than business administration, which traditionally focuses more on management, finance, and strategy and may not directly align with his described traits. However, it is still possible that he could be in business administration, hence the estimate is not zero.
