  "business administration": 0.2

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a business administration program. These traits suggest he might be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps engineering. However, there is still some chance that someone with his intelligence and appreciation for hard work could choose to apply these skills in a business context, hence the value is not zero but rather on the lower side.
