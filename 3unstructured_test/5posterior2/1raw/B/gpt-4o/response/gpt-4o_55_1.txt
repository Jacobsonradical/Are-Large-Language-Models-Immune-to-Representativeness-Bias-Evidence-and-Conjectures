Explanation: Adam's personality sketch suggests a strong affinity for nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts, and while these traits don't completely rule out an interest in business administration, they are more commonly aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. The traits mentioned do not strongly correlate with the typical interests and skills associated with business administration. Therefore, while it is possible that Adam could be enrolled in a business administration program, the probability is relatively low compared to other fields that better match his interests and personality.
