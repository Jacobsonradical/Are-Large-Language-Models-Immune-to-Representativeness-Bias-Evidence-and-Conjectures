Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer that his characteristics align more closely with fields related to nature, animals, puzzle-solving, empathy, and high intelligence, rather than business administration. The appreciation for hard work and dedication is a trait that can be found in many fields, including business administration, but his specific interests and qualities seem to lean more toward fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or similar areas.

With this in mind, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is likely quite low. Therefore, an estimate would be:

{
  "business administration": 0.1
