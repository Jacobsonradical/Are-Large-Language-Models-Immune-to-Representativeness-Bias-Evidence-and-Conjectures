  "business administration": 0.1

Given Adam's personality sketch, his interests and attributes seem to be more aligned with fields related to nature, biology, or perhaps even fields like psychology due to his empathy and understanding of abstract concepts. Business administration typically requires a different set of personality traits such as a strong focus on economic principles, leadership, extensive interaction with people, and possibly less direct engagement with nature and animals. Therefore, the posterior conditional probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration is relatively low.
