This estimate is based on the fact that Adamâ€™s personality sketch does not explicitly align with the typical interests and traits associated with a field like business administration. His genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest he may be more inclined towards fields such as environmental science, biology, or psychology. However, his high intelligence and appreciation for hard work could give him the skills necessary to succeed in business administration, hence a moderate, but not high, probability is assigned.
