  "business administration": 0.2

Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts, and the fact that he has a high level of empathy and appreciation for hard work, it seems less likely that he would choose a field like business administration, which typically does not focus on those specific interests. However, it's not impossible, as his intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be beneficial in business. Thus, a relatively low probability, but not zero.
