  "business administration": 0.2
}

Given that Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, empathy, animals, and abstract concepts, it seems less likely that he would be pursuing a degree in business administration, which generally focuses more on economics, management, finance, and related subjects. His personality traits and interests align more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or perhaps even philosophy. However, there is still some possibility he might be interested in business administration, especially in contexts where it intersects with sustainability or similar fields, so a probability of 0.2 seems reasonable.
