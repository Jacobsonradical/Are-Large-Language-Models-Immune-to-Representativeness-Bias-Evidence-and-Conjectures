Given Adam's personality sketch, his interests and traits seem more aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration. His genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, combined with a love for animals and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, are more indicative of someone pursuing a career in the natural or life sciences. His quiet demeanor and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest a preference for research-oriented fields. Therefore, the probability of Adam being enrolled in a business administration program is relatively low.
