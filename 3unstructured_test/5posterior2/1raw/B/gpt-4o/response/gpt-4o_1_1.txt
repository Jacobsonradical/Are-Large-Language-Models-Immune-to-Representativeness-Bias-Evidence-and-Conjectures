  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adamâ€™s personality sketch, which suggests he has a genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, it's less likely he would be drawn to a field like business administration. His interest in nature, animals, and solving puzzles may align more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology. While it's not impossible for someone with Adam's traits to choose business administration, it seems less probable given his described interests and characteristics.
