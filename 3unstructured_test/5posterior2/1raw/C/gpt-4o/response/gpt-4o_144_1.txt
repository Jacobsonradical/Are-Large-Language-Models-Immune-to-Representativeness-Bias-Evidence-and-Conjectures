Explanation: Adam's sketch highlights his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, suggesting that he might lean towards biological or environmental sciences. However, his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are qualities that align with studying computer science as well. Given this, there's a moderate probability, estimated at 0.2, that Adam could be pursuing computer science despite the traits more closely aligning with other fields.
