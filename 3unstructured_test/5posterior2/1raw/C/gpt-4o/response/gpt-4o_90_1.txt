The estimate is based on the personality traits described, which align well with the analytical and problem-solving skills typical of computer science students. However, Adam's strong empathy, warmth, appreciation for hard work, and deep love for nature might make him equally likely or inclined towards other fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. The variety of interests suggests a probability that isn't too high but still reflects a reasonable likelihood of enrollment in computer science.
