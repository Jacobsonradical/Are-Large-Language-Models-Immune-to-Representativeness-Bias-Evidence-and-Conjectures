Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the probabilities in terms of the characteristics mentioned. Adam exhibits qualities that align well with fields that require intelligence, the ability to understand abstract concepts, and an appreciation for hard work. However, specific indicators for an inclination towards computer science, such as a particular interest in technology, programming, or mathematics, are not mentioned. Given his love for nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles, he may be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science or related areas, but since computer science also involves solving puzzles and abstract thinking, we cannot discount it entirely.

Thus, under consideration of the available information:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This value reflects a moderate likelihood but acknowledges that other fields could be a better match given Adam's detailed interests.
