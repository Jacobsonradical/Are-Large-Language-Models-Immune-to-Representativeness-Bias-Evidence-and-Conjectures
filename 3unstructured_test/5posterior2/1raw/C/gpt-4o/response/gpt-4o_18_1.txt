{
  "computer science": 0.4
}

The reasoning behind this estimation is as follows:

Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are traits that align well with the requirements of a computer science program. These programs often demand strong problem-solving skills, akin to his enjoyment of solving puzzles. However, his genuine curiosity about nature and deep love for animals suggest a possible inclination towards fields like biology or environmental science. Additionally, his empathy and warm heart might lead him towards fields with a social or ecological impact. 

Considering these aspects, there is a notable probability he might be in computer science, but it's balanced by the likelihood of him pursuing other fields that align with his interests in nature and animals. Hence, a moderate estimate of 0.4 is reasonable.
