Given Adam's interests and personality traits, his curiosity about nature and love for animals might make fields like biology, environmental science, or zoology more likely. However, his high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts also align well with computer science. Due to this, while not the highest likelihood, there is still a reasonable probability that he could be enrolled in computer science.
