Explanation: Adam's personality sketch mentions a passion for understanding abstract concepts, which aligns well with the theoretical and problem-solving nature of computer science. However, his pronounced interest in nature, plants, and animals suggests he might also be drawn towards fields like biology, environmental science, or even bioinformatics. Given this blend of traits, a lower probability for computer science is reasonable, reflecting the diverse fields his characteristics could lead to.
