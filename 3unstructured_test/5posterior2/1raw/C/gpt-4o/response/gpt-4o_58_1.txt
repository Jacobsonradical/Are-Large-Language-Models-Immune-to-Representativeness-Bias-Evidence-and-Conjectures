  "computer science": 0.2
}

Adam's personality sketch suggests interests and qualities more aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology, given his curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts. While his high intelligence and problem-solving skills might make computer science a plausible choice, the emphasis on empathy, nature, and animals makes it less likely as a primary field of study compared to others more directly connected to his explicit interests. Thus, a probability of 0.2 reflects a moderate but not dominant likelihood.
