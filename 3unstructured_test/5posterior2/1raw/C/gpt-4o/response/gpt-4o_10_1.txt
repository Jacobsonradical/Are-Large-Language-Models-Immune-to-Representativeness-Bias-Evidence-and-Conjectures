Explanation:
Adam's personality sketch highlights several traits such as a curiosity about nature and plants, a quiet demeanor, a love for animals, a strong empathy, and high intelligence with an ability to understand abstract concepts. Although these traits do not directly indicate an interest in computer science, his high intelligence and good grasp of abstract concepts could make computer science appealing to him. Additionally, his penchant for solving puzzles overlaps well with the problem-solving skills essential in computer science. However, given his other interests in nature and animals, computer science might not be his primary field of study, leading to a moderate probability estimate.
