  "computer science": 0.3

Given Adam's personality traits, his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology might seem more intuitively fitting. However, his high intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could also align well with computer science. Therefore, while not the most obvious fit compared to the natural sciences, there's still a reasonable chance he could be in a computer science program, especially if he's interested in fields like bioinformatics or computational biology that blend his interests. So, a conditional probability of 0.3 seems appropriate.
