Explanation: Based on Adam's personality sketch, his strong appreciation for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts suggest that he could have an interest in a field like computer science. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals may also drive his interests towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science. Thus, while there is a reasonable chance that he might have pursued computer science, his inclination towards nature and animal-related fields slightly lowers the probability.
