The interpretation of Adam's personality sketch suggests a higher likelihood of being involved in fields that relate more directly to nature, plants, or animals, such as biology or environmental science. Although someone with his intelligence and problem-solving ability could certainly thrive in computer science, the specific interests outlined in his personality sketch seem to align more closely with the natural sciences. Therefore, while it's possible that he could be in computer science, it's less likely given the characteristics described.
