Given Adam's strong intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, there is a reasonable likelihood that he could be enrolled in computer science. However, his deep love for nature, empathy, and interest in plants might suggest stronger inclinations towards fields such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies. Therefore, while it is plausible, the probability has been adjusted to reflect these competing interests.
