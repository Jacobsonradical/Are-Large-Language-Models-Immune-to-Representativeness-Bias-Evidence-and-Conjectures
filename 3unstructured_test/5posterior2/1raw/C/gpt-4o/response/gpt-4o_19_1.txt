  "computer science": 0.3
}

Given Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, it's plausible that he could be enrolled in computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants suggest a stronger alignment with fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology. Therefore, while it's not out of the question, it's less likely that computer science is his primary field of study compared to these other areas. Hence, the posterior conditional probability of 0.3 reflects this consideration.
