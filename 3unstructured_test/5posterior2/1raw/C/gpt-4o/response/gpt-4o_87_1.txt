Given Adam's personality sketch, he appears to have a strong inclination towards nature, animals, and understanding abstract concepts. These traits might be more typically associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. However, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence could also make him a good fit for computer science, especially in areas like artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, or environmental technology.

Considering these factors, while he could be in computer science, the probability isn't exceedingly high but still notable due to his problem-solving ability and intelligence.
