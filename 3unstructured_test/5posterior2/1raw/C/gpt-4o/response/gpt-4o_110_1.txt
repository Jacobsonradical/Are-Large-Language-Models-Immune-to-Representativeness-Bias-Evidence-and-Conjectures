Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are traits often seen in computer science students. His curiosity for solving puzzles also aligns well with the problem-solving nature of the field. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals suggests a potential interest in fields like biology, environmental science, or ecology. Hence, while there is a notable probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, it is not overwhelmingly high.
