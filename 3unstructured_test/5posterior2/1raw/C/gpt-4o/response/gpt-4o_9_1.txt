Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems he has traits and interests that align with fields requiring analytical thinking and appreciation for abstract concepts. Although his love for nature and animals may suggest something like biology or environmental science, his intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts are also highly relevant to computer science. Therefore, a moderate probability estimate seems appropriate.
