Here's the rationale for this estimate: 

Adam's personality sketch indicates a blend of traits such as a high level of intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, all of which are commonly associated with computer science. However, his genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals might lead him towards fields that directly involve these interests, such as biology, ecology, or environmental science. Therefore, while the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is moderate given his intelligence and affinity for puzzles, it is not overwhelmingly high due to his strong inclination towards nature and animals.
