Given Adam's personality traits, particularly his love for nature, animals, and his empathy, it seems slightly more likely that he might be interested in fields such as environmental science, biology, or psychology. However, his high intelligence and skill in solving puzzles could certainly fit well with the analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science. Therefore, while it is possible he was enrolled in computer science, it might not be the most probable choice given his personality sketch.
