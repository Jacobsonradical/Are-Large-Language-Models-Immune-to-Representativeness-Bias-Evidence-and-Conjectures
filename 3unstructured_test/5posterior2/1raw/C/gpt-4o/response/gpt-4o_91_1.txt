  "computer science": 0.3
}

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and interest in puzzles, it seems more likely that he would be inclined toward fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also align with computer science. Thus, while a significant probability exists that he could be in computer science, it might not be the most likely field. Hence, I estimate a probability of 0.3.
