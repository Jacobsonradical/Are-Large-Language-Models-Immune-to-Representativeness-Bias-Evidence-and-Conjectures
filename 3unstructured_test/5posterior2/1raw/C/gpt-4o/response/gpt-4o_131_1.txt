Given Adam's personality sketch, there are several traits that might align well with computer science, such as his high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and love for solving puzzles. However, his strong curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and empathy might suggest a stronger inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary sciences. Thus, while there is a reasonable possibility that Adam could be enrolled in computer science, it might not be the most likely choice based on the personality traits described.
