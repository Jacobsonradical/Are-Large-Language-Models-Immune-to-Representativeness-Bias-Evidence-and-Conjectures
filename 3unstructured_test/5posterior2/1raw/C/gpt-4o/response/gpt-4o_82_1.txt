Given Adam's personality traits—curiosity about nature and plants, a quiet demeanor, enjoyment of puzzles, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work—it's possible, though not overwhelmingly likely, that he would be enrolled in a field like computer science. His traits align well with fields like biology, environmental science, or related areas where his love for nature and animals could be directly applied. However, the enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence are traits that also fit a computer science profile to some degree, thus a non-zero probability is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as 0.2.
