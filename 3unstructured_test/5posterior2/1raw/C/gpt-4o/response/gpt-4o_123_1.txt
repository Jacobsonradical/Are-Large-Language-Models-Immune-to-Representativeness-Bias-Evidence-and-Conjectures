Given Adam's personality sketch and the fact that he was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, we can make some reasonable estimates. 

Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals suggests a natural inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, or ecology. However, his high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could be indicative of a fit for computer science as well, specifically in fields like bioinformatics or computational biology.

Taking these factors into consideration, here's the estimated posterior conditional probability for Adam being enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

This probability reflects the balance between his interests in nature and puzzles, with a moderate likelihood that his problem-solving skills could lead him toward computer science, especially in interdisciplinary areas.
