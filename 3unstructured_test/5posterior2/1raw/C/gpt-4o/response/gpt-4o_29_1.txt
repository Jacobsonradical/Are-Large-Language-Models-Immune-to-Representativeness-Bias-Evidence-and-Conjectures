While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are traits that align well with computer science, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathetic nature may suggest that he could be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology. Therefore, I estimate the probability that he was enrolled in computer science to be moderate but not the highest.
