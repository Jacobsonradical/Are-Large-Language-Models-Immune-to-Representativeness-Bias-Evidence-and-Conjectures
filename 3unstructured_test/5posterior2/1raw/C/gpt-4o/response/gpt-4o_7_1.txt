  "computer science": "0.3"

Given Adam's personality sketch, highlighting his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and a focus on understanding abstract concepts, he could be a fit for a variety of academic fields. However, computer science is plausibly an option due to his high intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles and abstract thinking. While it might not be the most obvious choice compared to fields like biology or environmental science, his problem-solving abilities and appreciation for hard work could certainly align with the challenges presented in computer science. Thus, a 0.3 estimate reflects a moderate but not dominant likelihood.
