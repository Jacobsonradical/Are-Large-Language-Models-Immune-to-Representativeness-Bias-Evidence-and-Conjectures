Given Adam's personality sketch, his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles align well with fields that involve critical thinking and problem-solving. However, his strong empathy, appreciation for hard work in nature, and deep love for animals suggest that he might be inclined toward life sciences or environmental studies rather than computer science specifically. Therefore, while it's possible that he could be in computer science due to his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, the probability seems lower compared to fields that are directly related to nature and animals.
