Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, these traits do not naturally suggest a strong inclination towards computer science, which is more commonly associated with interests in technology, mathematics, and logical problem-solving. However, his high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles do align with the skills required in computer science. This mixture of characteristics suggests a moderate but not overwhelming likelihood that Adam was enrolled in a computer science program.
