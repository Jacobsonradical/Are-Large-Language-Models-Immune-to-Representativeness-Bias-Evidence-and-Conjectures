Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology seem to align more closely with his interests. While his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are qualities that are beneficial in computer science, the subject's passion for nature and animals suggests he may lean towards fields that directly engage with these interests. Thus, while it's possible he might be in computer science, the probability is moderate rather than high.
