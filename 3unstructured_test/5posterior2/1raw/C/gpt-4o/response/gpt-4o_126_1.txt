  "computer science": 0.2
}

Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do align well with the skills needed in computer science. However, his strong curiosity about nature, plant life, empathy, and love for animals suggests a leaning towards fields such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology, which might be more fitting given his personality sketch. While it's possible he chose computer science, it seems less probable compared to other fields more directly related to his interests in nature and empathy. Therefore, a probability of 0.2 seems reasonable.
