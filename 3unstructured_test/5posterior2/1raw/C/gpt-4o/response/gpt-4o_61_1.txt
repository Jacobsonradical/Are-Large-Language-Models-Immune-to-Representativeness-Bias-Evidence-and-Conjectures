Explanation:
Adam's personality traits indicate a strong affinity for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, all of which are relevant and valuable skills in computer science. However, his deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work and dedication might suggest a broader range of interests beyond just computer science. Thus, while it's plausible that Adam could have been enrolled in computer science, his diverse set of interests means there's also a reasonable chance he pursued a different field. Therefore, the probability is estimated at 0.3.
