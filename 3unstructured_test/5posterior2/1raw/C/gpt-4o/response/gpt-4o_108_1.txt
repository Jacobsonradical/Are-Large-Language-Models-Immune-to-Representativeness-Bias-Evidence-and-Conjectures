Given Adam's personality sketch, several traits are particularly relevant when considering the probability that he was enrolled in computer science. His curiosity about nature, high intelligence, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the intellectual challenges typical of computer science. However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he might be equally or more interested in fields related to environmental sciences, biology, or other nature-focused disciplines. Therefore, while there is a reasonable chance he could be enrolled in computer science, it is not overwhelmingly probable. Hence, the estimated posterior conditional probability is 0.3.
