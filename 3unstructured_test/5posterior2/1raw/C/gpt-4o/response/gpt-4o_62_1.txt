  "computer science": 0.25

Given Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, enrollment in computer science is certainly possible. However, his curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and empathy might incline him more towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies. Therefore, I estimate the probability that Adam was studying computer science at around 0.25.
