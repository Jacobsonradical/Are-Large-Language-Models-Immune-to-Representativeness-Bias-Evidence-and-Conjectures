Adam's profile suggests strong analytical skills, empathy, and love for nature and animals. While these traits do not directly point towards computer science, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are indeed relevant. However, other fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology might align even better with his interests and personality, hence the value isn't extremely high.
