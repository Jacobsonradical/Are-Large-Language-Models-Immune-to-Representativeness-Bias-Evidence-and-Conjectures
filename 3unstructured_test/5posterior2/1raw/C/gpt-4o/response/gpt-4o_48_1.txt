Given Adamâ€™s personality sketch, the probability that he was enrolled in computer science is relatively moderate but not high. This is based on a combination of factors from the sketch:

- Adam's strong intelligence and inclination towards solving puzzles are traits that align well with computer science.
- His appreciation for abstract concepts is also a good match for the theoretical aspects of computer science.

However, some parts of his personality, such as his deep love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy and warm heart, suggest interests that may lean more towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine.

Hence, while Adam would likely do well in computer science given his intellectual capabilities, his specific interests as described make it less probable compared to disciplines closely related to nature and life sciences.
