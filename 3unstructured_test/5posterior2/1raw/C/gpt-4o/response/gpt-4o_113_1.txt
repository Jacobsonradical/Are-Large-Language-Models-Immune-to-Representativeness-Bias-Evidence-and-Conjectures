Given Adam's personality traits, interests, and characteristics, it's plausible he's enrolled in computer science, especially because the field often requires high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and an affinity for solving puzzles. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals suggests that he might be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies. Therefore, the probability isn't extremely high but still significant, at around 0.3.
