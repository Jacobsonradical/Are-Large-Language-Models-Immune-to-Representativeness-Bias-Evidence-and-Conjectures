  "computer science": 0.2

Explanation: Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have a broad array of interests that might lead him toward fields that allow for exploration of nature and animals. While computer science certainly involves solving puzzles and abstract thinking—qualities that align with Adam's skills—the overall impression given by his love for nature, animals, and hard work hints more strongly toward fields such as biology, environmental science, or something related to natural sciences. Consequently, while computer science remains a possibility, other fields seem more directly aligned with his interests. Thus, a relatively lower probability estimate around 0.2 seems reasonable.
