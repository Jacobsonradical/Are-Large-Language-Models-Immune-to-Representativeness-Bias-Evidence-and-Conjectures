  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation: Based on Adam's personality sketch, his interests and traits align more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or veterinary medicine, given his love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles. However, his high intelligence and strong understanding of abstract concepts also make computer science a plausible option, albeit slightly less likely compared to the aforementioned fields. Thus, an estimated posterior probability of 0.3 reflects that it is possible but not the most probable field for Adam.
