  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation: Given Adam's personality traits, such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work, he might be inclined towards fields that are more directly connected to natural sciences or life sciences. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do align well with computer science. Therefore, while it's possible that Adam could be enrolled in computer science, the probability might be slightly lower compared to fields more aligned with direct nature or life sciences interests. Hence, a value of around 0.3 seems reasonable.
