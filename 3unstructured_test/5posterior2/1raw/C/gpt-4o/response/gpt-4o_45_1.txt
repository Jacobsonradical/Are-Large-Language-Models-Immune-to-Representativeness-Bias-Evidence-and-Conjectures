Adam's high intelligence and proficiency in understanding abstract concepts suggest he could have the aptitude for computer science. His enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns well with problem-solving skills needed in this field. However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals might also pull him toward fields related to biology, environmental science, or psychology, creating some diversification in the probability. Hence, the estimate is moderate rather than high.
