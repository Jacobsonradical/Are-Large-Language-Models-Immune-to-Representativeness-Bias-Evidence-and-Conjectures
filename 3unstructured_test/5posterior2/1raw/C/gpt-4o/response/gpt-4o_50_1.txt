  "computer science": 0.25
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, he exhibits a strong curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, and has a high level of empathy and intelligence. While these traits can certainly align with a field such as computer science due to the problem-solving and abstract thinking involved, his deep love for animals, nature, and appreciation for hard work and dedication might slightly skew him toward fields like biology, environmental science, or another natural science. However, the ability to understand and appreciate complex systems and concepts could still make computer science a plausible field for him, hence the estimate of 0.25.
