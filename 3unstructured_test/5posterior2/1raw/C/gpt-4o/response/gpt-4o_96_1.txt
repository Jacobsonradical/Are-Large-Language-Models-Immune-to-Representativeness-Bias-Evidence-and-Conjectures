Given Adam's detailed personality sketch, while he possesses high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which are significant indicators for success in computer science, his strong empathy, love for nature and animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align him more closely with fields such as biology or environmental science. However, his abstract thinking capability still gives him a reasonable chance of being in computer science, albeit not the highest. Therefore, a conditional probability estimate of about 0.3 seems appropriate.
