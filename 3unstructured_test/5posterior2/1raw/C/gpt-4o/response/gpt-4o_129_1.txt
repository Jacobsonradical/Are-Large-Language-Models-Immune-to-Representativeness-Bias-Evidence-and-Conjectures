  "computer science": 0.2
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his interests in nature, animals, and puzzles suggest a propensity for fields that involve detailed observation, logical thinking, and possibly a connection to the environment. While his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are suitable for computer science, the sketch does not explicitly mention a passion for programming or technology, making it less likely compared to other fields like biology or environmental science. Hence, an estimate of 0.2 reflects a moderate but not strong likelihood that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality traits.
