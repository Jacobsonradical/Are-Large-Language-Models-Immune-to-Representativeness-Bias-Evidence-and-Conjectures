Based on the provided personality sketch, Adam seems to have several traits that could align with computer science, such as enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. However, his strong curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and empathy suggest interests that might also align well with other fields, such as biology or environmental science. Given these mixed signals, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science can be reasonably estimated, but it is not definitively high.
