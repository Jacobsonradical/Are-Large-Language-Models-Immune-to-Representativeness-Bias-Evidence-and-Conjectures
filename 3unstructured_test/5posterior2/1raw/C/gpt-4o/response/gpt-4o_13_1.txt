Note: My estimate takes into account Adam's quiet demeanor, intelligence, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, which align with characteristics often found in computer science students. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest he might be equally or more interested in fields like biology, environmental science, or a related discipline. Consequently, while there is a probability that he might be in computer science, it is not overwhelmingly high given the broader context of his interests.
