Given Adam's personality sketch and background information, the estimate of the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```
This estimate is based on Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science. However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and love for animals might also make him interested in fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology. Hence, the probability is not exceedingly high but still significant.
