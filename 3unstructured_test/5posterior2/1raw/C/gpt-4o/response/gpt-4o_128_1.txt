Explanation: Adam displays traits such as high intelligence, an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, which align well with the skills required for computer science. However, his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm empathy might suggest he could also be interested in fields like biology or environmental science. Hence, while it is plausible he might be pursuing computer science, the probability is not overwhelmingly high.
