Given Adam's personality sketch, while he has the intellectual capability and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts that would align well with computer science, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for nature suggest that fields related to biology, environmental science, or similar areas might be more aligned with his interests. Solving puzzles could be an aspect he enjoys, but without additional context linking him specifically to computer science, it's not as certain. Thus, the probability is moderate but not overwhelmingly high.
