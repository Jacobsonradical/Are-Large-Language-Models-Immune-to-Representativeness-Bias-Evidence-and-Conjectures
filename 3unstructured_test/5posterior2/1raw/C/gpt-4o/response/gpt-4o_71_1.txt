Given Adam's interest in nature, animals, and puzzles, along with his intelligence and empathy, it's possible but not highly probable that he was enrolled in a computer science program compared to other fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. His strong empathy and love for animals suggest a natural inclination towards fields related to life sciences. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do provide some basis for the possibility of computer science, leading to a moderate estimate.
