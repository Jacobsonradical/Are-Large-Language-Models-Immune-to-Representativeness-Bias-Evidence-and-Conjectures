Given Adam’s personality traits—curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work—there is some alignment with the qualities of a graduate student in computer science, particularly the characteristics of high intelligence and liking to solve puzzles. However, his strong interest in nature and animals might make fields like biology or environmental science more likely. Therefore, while it is plausible that he is in computer science, it's not the most probable field based on the given personality sketch.
