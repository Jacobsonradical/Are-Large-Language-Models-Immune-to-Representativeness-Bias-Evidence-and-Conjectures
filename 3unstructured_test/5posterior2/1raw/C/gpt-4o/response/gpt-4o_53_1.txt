{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation:
Adam's personality sketch describes someone with high intelligence, an aptitude for solving puzzles, and a good understanding of abstract concepts. These traits align well with skills necessary for computer science. However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature might suggest that he could be equally or more interested in a field like biology, environmental science, or even psychology. Given this, the probability is not extremely high but still significant considering the alignment of some traits with computer science.
