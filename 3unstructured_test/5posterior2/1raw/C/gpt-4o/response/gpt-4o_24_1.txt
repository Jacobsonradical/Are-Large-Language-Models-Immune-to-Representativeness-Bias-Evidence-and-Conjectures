Explanation: Based on Adam's personality sketch, he shows a high interest in nature, animals, empathy, and abstract concepts. Although these traits point more towards fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, his high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts can also suggest that computer science is a viable option for him, especially if he is involved in areas like artificial intelligence or computational biology. Therefore, while not the most likely field, there is a reasonable probability that Adam could be enrolled in computer science, though it might not be the predominant choice given his other interests.
