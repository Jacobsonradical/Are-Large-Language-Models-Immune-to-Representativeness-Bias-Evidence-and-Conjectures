Given Adam's interests and personality traits, he could very well be in a variety of fields. His love for nature and animals might make one consider fields like biology or environmental science, but his affinity for puzzles and high intelligence also align well with computer science, which requires abstract thinking and problem-solving skills. Therefore, while computer science is a possibility, it is not the most directly aligned field with his explicitly expressed interests.
