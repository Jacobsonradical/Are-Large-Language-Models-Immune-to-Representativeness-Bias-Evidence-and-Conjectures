  "computer science": 0.3
}

Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals along with his empathy and warm-hearted nature, his personality traits seem to align more closely with fields related to biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies. However, his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, as well as his enjoyment of solving puzzles, also align reasonably well with computer science. Therefore, while computer science is not the most likely field based on the complete personality sketch, it remains a plausible option, hence the estimate of 0.3.
