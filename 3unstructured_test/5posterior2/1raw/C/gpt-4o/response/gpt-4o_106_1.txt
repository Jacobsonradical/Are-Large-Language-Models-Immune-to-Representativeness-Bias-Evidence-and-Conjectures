  "computer science": 0.35

This estimate considers Adam's high intelligence, skill in understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, which are relevant traits for success in computer science. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals suggests he might be equally—or more—attracted to fields such as biology, environmental science, or a related discipline. Consequently, while there's a moderate likelihood he could be in computer science, it's not the most dominant probability given his personality sketch.
