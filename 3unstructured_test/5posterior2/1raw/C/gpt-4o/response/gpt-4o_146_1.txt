This probability estimate is based on the following considerations:

- Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might make him well-suited for computer science.
- His curiosity and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with the problem-solving nature of computer science.
- However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature might suggest a tendency toward fields such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies, potentially lowering the likelihood of him choosing computer science.

Given these considerations, a reasonable posterior conditional probability estimate for him being enrolled in computer science is approximately 0.3.
