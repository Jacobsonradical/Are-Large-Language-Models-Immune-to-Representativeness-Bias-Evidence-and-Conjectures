{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

I estimated a conditional probability of 0.3 for Adam being enrolled in computer science based on his personality sketch. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills needed for computer science. However, the personality traits mentioned (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) might be more aligned with fields related to biology or environmental science, which slightly decreases the likelihood.
