Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, he seems to have diverse interests and skills that overlap with multiple fields. However, evaluating the likelihood of him being enrolled in computer science would depend on balancing his personality traits against common characteristics found in computer science students.

Adam's strengths include high intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, all of which align well with the skills required in computer science. However, his pronounced interest in nature, plants, and animals, coupled with his empathy and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, might suggest he could be well-suited for fields like biology, environmental science, or related interdisciplinary studies. While these aren't disqualifying factors for a computer science student, they could influence the probability.

Given this, I'll estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
