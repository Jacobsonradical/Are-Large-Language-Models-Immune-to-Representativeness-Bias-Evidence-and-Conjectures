This estimate considers Adam's high intelligence and his comfort with abstract concepts and solving puzzles, which are traits conducive to success in computer science. However, his strong interest in nature and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, might also lead him to pursue fields related to biology, environmental science, or animal studies. Therefore, while there is a notable probability he might be in computer science, it's not overwhelmingly high given his diverse interests.
