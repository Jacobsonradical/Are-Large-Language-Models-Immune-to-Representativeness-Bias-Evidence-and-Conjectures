  "computer science": "0.3"

Adam's personality traits suggest he has a strong appreciation for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which could align with fields like biology or environmental science. However, his high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles are also compatible with computer science. While it's not the most obvious fit given his strong empathy and love for nature, which could suggest a preference for more hands-on, nature-focused fields, there is still a reasonable probability that he could be drawn to computer science due to the intellectual challenges and abstract problem-solving it involves. Hence, a moderate likelihood value of 0.3 is assigned.
