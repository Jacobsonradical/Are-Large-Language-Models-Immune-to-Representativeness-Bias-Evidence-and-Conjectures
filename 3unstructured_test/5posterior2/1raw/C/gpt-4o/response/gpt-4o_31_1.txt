  "computer science": 0.3
}

Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, and his strong empathy, it seems his profile might not directly point to computer science as the most likely field. However, his high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and interest in solving puzzles suggest that computer science could still be a plausible field of study for him. Combining these factors, an estimate of 0.3 for the conditional probability seems reasonable.
