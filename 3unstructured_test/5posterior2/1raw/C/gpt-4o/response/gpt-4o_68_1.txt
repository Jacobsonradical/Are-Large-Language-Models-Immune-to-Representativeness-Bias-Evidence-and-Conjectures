Given Adam's personality sketch, his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles might lead him towards computer science, particularly fields like bioinformatics or computational biology where he could combine his interests. However, the direct connection from his personality traits to core computer science is not very strong. Thus, I assign a 0.3 probability to the likelihood that he was enrolled in computer science.
