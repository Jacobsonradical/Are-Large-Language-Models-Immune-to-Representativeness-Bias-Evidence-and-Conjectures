  "computer science": 0.6
}

Given Adam's characteristics—high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles—it is plausible that he might be drawn to computer science. While his curiosity about nature and love for animals might suggest other fields such as biology or environmental science, the fit with his analytical skills and enjoyment of problem-solving activities makes computer science a fairly strong possibility. Hence, I estimate the probability at 0.6.
