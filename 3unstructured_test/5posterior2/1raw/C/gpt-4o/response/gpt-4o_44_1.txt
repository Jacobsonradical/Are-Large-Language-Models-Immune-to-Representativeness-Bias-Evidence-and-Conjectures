Explanation: Adam's personality sketch indicates a strong affinity for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, which might be more closely aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, or zoology. While his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are a fit for computer science, there is no specific indication in the sketch that he has an interest in or passion for technology or computing. Therefore, the probability is moderate but not high.
