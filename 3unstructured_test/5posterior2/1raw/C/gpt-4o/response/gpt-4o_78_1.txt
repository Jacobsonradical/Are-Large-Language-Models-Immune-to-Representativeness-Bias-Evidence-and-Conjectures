Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems to possess traits valuable in many fields, especially those involving analytical thinking, empathy, and a keen interest in nature and animals. While computer science is certainly a field that requires high intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts, his strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he might lean more toward fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Thus, the probability is somewhat moderate but not overly high.
