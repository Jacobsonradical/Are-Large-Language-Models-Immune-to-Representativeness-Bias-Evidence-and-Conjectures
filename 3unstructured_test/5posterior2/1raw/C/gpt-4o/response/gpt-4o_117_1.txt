Given Adam's personality sketch, he exhibits high intelligence, a propensity for solving puzzles, and a comfort with abstract concepts, all of which align with typical traits beneficial for computer science. His appreciation for hard work and detail-orientation are also critical qualities in this field. Although his deep love for nature, plants, animals, and strong empathy might suggest other fields like biology or environmental science, individuals with such diverse interests can often bridge these disciplines through computational fields like bioinformatics or environmental data science. Therefore, it would be reasonable to estimate a moderate probability that Adam could be enrolled in computer science, balancing his intellectual traits with his interests in nature and animals.
