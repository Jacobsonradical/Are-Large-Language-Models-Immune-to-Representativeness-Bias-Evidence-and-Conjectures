Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems plausible but not highly likely that he was enrolled in computer science. His strong intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do fit well with the requirements of computer science. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his quiet personality and strong empathy, might align better with fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology. Therefore, the conditional probability is moderate but not high.
