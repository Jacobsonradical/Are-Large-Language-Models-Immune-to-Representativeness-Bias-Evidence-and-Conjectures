  "computer science": 0.3
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, aspects such as his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts make computer science a plausible field for him. Additionally, his curiosity about nature and enjoyment in solving puzzles align well with the problem-solving and analytical skills valued in computer science. However, his deep love for animals and empathy might also suggest interests in fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies. Thus, while computer science is a reasonable guess, there are other fields that might align more closely with his empathetic and nature-oriented attributes, which is why the estimate is 0.3 rather than closer to 1.
