  "computer science": 0.3
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and deep love for animals suggest that fields related to biology, environmental science, or perhaps veterinary studies might be more likely. However, his high intelligence and capability of understanding abstract concepts are also crucial traits for success in computer science. Therefore, while it's not the most obvious fit based on his personality sketch, there is still a reasonable probability that he could be enrolled in computer science, particularly if his interest in puzzles and abstract thinking were directed toward that field. Thus, I estimate a posterior conditional probability of about 0.3.
