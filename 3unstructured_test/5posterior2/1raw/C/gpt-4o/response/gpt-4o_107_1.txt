Explanation:
While Adam's profile suggests a high level of intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts, which are crucial for success in computer science, his strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature tend to align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies. These aspects make computer science less likely as his enrolled field compared to more nature-oriented or animal-related disciplines. Therefore, the probability is relatively low but not negligible.
