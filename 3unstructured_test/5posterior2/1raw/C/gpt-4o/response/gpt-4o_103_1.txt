Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and problem-solving skills are traits often associated with success in computer science. However, his deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy might also align him more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. Therefore, while it is possible that Adam is studying computer science, the probability isn't overwhelmingly high.
