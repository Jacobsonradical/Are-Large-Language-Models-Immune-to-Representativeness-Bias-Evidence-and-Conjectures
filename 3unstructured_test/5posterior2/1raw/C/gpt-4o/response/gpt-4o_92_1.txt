Given Adam's personality sketch, there are elements that suggest a potential fit for computer science, such as his high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts. However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals may point towards fields more closely related to nature and life sciences. Therefore, while it is possible that Adam could be enrolled in computer science, the probability isn't overwhelmingly high.
