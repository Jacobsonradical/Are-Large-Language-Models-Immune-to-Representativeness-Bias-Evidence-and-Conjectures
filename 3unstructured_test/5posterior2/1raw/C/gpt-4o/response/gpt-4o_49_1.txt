  "computer science": 0.4

Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy, it seems more likely that he might be drawn to fields directly related to life sciences, such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. However, his high intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest that computer science is still a plausible field for him to be enrolled in, though perhaps not the most obvious one. Therefore, a conditional probability of 0.4 reflects a moderate likelihood that Adam was enrolled in computer science, factoring in his various personality traits.
