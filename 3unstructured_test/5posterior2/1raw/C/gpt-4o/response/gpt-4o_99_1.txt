Explanation: While Adam has qualities like high intelligence, an aptitude for solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts (qualities that are beneficial for a computer science student), his strong traits in empathy, curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest that other fields like biology or environmental science may be more aligned with his interests and passions. Hence, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality might be moderate but not very high.
