{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

This estimate is based on the fact that Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with the typical skills and interests of computer science students. However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and love for nature and animals might steer him towards other fields, thus making a probability estimate of 0.3 seem reasonable.
