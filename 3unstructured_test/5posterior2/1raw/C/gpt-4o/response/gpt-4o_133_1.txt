Given Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for solving puzzles, and strong understanding of abstract concepts, it is plausible that he could be enrolled in computer science. However, the strong focus on nature, plants, and animals might suggest he has interests that could align with other fields as well, such as biology or environmental science. A probability of 0.6 reflects a relatively strong but not definitive likelihood that he is in computer science.
