Given Adam's personality sketch, the probability that he was enrolled in computer science is not particularly high, but it is plausible. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills needed for computer science. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals suggests a potential interest in fields like biology, environmental science, or even interdisciplinary areas involving technology and nature. Thus, while computer science remains a possibility, it is not the most likely field given his interests and personality traits, leading to an estimated probability of 0.3.
