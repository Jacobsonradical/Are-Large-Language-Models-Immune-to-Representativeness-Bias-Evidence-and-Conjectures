Based on Adam's personality sketch, let's consider each field in turn:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts. These traits are often associated with fields that involve problem-solving and analytical thinking, such as computer science.

2. **Business Administration**: While Adam has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could be relevant in a business context, his genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals suggest he might be more interested in fields related to nature and the environment rather than business. 

Considering these points, the posterior probabilities might look something like the following:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values are not definitive and are based on an interpretation of the given personality sketch in relation to typical traits associated with each field.
