Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding of abstract concepts, it is conceivable that he might be enrolled in a field that involves analytical and logical thinking. Computer science fits this profile relatively well due to its emphasis on problem-solving, abstract thinking, and potentially, applications like bioinformatics which can combine his interest in nature with computational skills.

On the other hand, business administration typically demands a different set of dominant traits, such as a strong inclination towards leadership, management, and organizational skills. Given Adam's personality sketch, there is less evidence suggesting that he fits the archetype commonly associated with business administration, hence the lower probability.
