Given Adam's personality sketch, we should assess the likelihood of him being enrolled in each field based on the alignment of his traits with typical traits and interests of students in those fields. Here's how we might reasonably estimate those probabilities:

- **Computer Science**: Adam has an interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and a strong understanding of abstract concepts—all qualities beneficial for a computer science student. However, there’s no direct mention of interest in technology or software, which tempers the probability slightly.
- **Business Administration**: Adam does not seem to exhibit typical interests associated with business administration, such as a focus on management, economy, or entrepreneurship. His deep love for nature, empathy, and love for animals are less aligned with a straightforward path in business administration.

Based on this qualitative analysis, the estimates might be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

These values suggest that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration given his personality traits, but it's still not highly definitive. Other fields such as environmental science, biology, or psychology might be more aligned with his profile.
