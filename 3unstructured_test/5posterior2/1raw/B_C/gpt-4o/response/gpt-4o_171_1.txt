Based on Adam's personality sketch which emphasizes his curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, empathy, and love for animals, as well as his high intelligence and appreciation for hard work, here's a rough estimate of the posterior conditional probability for each of the given fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

The relatively low probability for business administration stems from the fact that none of the traits indicate a particular interest or skills aligned with business management or entrepreneurial activities. The probability for computer science is somewhat higher due to his enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, although the primary indicators seem to align him more closely with fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology.
