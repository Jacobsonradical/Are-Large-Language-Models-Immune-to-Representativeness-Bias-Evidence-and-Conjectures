To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch, we should take into account his interests, traits, and skills. Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys puzzles, has empathy, a love for animals, and is good at understanding abstract concepts, we can make educated guesses about his likelihood of being enrolled in specific fields.

Here are the evaluations for computer science and business administration:

- **Computer Science:** Given Adam's intelligence, aptitude for puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts, it is likely that he could be interested and skilled in computer science. However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals might suggest he is more inclined toward fields with a direct impact on living beings or the environment. Therefore, while computer science is a reasonable possibility, it may not be as strong as some other fields.

- **Business Administration:** Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with typical traits associated with business administration, such as leadership, strategic decision-making, or a focus on economics and organizational behavior. His appreciation for hard work and dedication is somewhat relevant, but his interests seem to veer more towards natural and abstract sciences than business.

Based on this analysis, the posterior conditional probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
