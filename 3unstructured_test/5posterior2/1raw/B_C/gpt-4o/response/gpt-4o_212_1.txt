Given Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for the graduate fields of business administration and computer science based on his traits:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits suggest an inclination towards fields that involve nature, abstract thinking, empathy, and possibly complex problem solving. Here's an estimate for the fields in question:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: While Adamâ€™s empathy and appreciation for hard work might align with business administration, his strong inclination towards nature, animals, and solving puzzles does not make this field a primary fit. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.
  
- **Computer Science**: Given his enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, computer science seems like a better fit compared to business administration, though it still doesn't directly connect to his love for nature and animals. However, computer science is a broad field that could cover interests like computational biology or environmental modeling, justifying a higher probability.
