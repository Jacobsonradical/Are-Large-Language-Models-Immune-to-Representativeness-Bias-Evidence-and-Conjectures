Sure, I'll provide the estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities given Adam's personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work rather than business-related interests or skills. While it is not impossible for someone with his traits to be in business administration, it seems less likely.
  
- Computer Science: Adam has a high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are all traits that fit well with computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals, while not ruling out computer science, might make this a slightly less probable choice than other fields that might directly align with his passion for nature and animals.
