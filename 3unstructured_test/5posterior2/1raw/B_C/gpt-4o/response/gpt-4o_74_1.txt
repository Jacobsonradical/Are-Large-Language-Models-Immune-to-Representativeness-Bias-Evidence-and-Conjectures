Explanation:

Given Adamâ€™s personality sketch, he appears highly curious about nature, empathetic, and capable of abstract thinking. These qualities inform the estimates as follows:

1. **Computer Science (0.2):**
   - Adam's intelligence and skill in abstract concepts make him a good fit for computer science, which often requires strong problem-solving abilities and logical thinking.
   - His interest in nature and empathy, while not directly related to computer science, do not exclude him from this field either.

2. **Business Administration (0.05):**
   - Adam's personality traits do not align well with the typical characteristics associated with business administration. Although empathy and understanding are valuable in business, his lack of focus on leadership, management, and economic concepts makes it less likely.
   - Business administration typically requires strong interpersonal and leadership skills, which are not strongly highlighted in the personality sketch.

These probabilities reflect a reasonable evaluation given Adam's interests and skills.
