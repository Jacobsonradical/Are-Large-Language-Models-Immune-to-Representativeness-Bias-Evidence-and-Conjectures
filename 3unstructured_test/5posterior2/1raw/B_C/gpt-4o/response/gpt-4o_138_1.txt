Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have a strong inclination towards fields that involve understanding nature, solving puzzles, and working with animals. While business administration doesn't directly align with these interests, there may still be a small chance if Adam is interested in environmental management or something similar. However, the likelihood seems relatively low.

For computer science, Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts make it a more plausible field for him. The analytical and problem-solving skills required in computer science match his personality traits, even though it doesn't directly involve his love for nature and animals.
