Sure, here are the estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.20
}

Adam's interests in nature, puzzles, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, make a direct fit with fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology seem more likely. Nonetheless, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also make him interested in computer science, albeit it seems less directly aligned with his personality sketch compared to some other fields. Business administration appears to be the least fitting given his described traits and interests.
