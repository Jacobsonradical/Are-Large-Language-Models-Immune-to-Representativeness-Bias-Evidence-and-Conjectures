Based on Adam's personality sketch—his curiosity about nature, love for animals, interest in puzzles, and strength in understanding abstract concepts—some inferences about his likelihood to be enrolled in certain graduate fields can be made. 

Business administration typically involves a focus on management, economics, marketing, and operations, which may not align as closely with Adam's described interests and personality traits.

Computer science encompasses problem-solving, abstract thinking, and often involves working with complex systems and puzzles, which seem to resonate more with Adam's traits. However, his pronounced empathy and love for animals might not directly correspond to this field specificially unless he were to follow a path intersecting with these interests, such as bioinformatics or animal behavior modeling.
