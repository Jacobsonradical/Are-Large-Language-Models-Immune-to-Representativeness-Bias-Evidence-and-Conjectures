Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems more likely that his interests and traits align better with fields that involve nature, puzzles, and abstract thinking. Business administration often requires a focus on interpersonal communication, leadership, and practical applications of business theory, which may not align perfectly with Adam's traits as described (e.g., love for nature, solving puzzles, empathy). On the other hand, computer science, especially fields like artificial intelligence, theoretical computer science, or bioinformatics, has a greater overlap with Adam's interests in puzzles, high intelligence, and abstract concepts.

Here are the estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
