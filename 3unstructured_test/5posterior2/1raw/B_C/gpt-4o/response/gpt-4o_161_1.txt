The estimate for "business administration" is relatively low given that Adam's personality traits and interests don't strongly align with typical characteristics needed or common in that field. On the other hand, "computer science" is higher in probability since his enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts fit well within the skill set typically found in this discipline. However, other fields, particularly those related to biology, environmental science, or animal behavior, might have even higher probabilities given Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals.
