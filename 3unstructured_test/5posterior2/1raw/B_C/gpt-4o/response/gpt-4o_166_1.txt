Based on the personality sketch of Adam and considering the fields of computer science and business administration, we can make some reasonable estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities.

Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and a high level of abstract thinking. These traits align more closely with fields that involve analytical thinking, complex problem-solving, and perhaps environmental or life sciences.

Noting that graduate students in computer science often possess strong abstract reasoning and problem-solving skills, but the field is not directly related to nature and empathy, we can assign a moderate probability here.

Graduate students in business administration may also possess analytical skills, but empathy and a love for animals don't strongly align with typical profiles.

Given these considerations:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
