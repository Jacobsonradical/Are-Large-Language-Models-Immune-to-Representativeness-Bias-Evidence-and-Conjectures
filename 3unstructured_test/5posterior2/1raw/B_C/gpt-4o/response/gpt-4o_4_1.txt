Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems to be more inclined towards fields that involve analytical thinking and an appreciation for nature and abstract concepts. While business administration involves hard work and dedication, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and preference for solving puzzles align more closely with a scientific or technical field like computer science. Hence, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of him being in computer science compared to business administration.
