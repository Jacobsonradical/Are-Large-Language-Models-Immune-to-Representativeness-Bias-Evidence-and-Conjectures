Based on Adam's personality sketch, let's estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for his enrollment in the fields of business administration and computer science:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles, suggesting an analytical mind.
- He has strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
- He's intelligent and good at abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Given these characteristics:

- **Business administration:** This field typically focuses on leadership, management, finance, and organizational skills. While some aspects of his personality might align (such as appreciation for hard work, intelligence, and empathy which could be advantageous in leadership roles), his curiosity about nature and love for animals don't strongly align with the typical interests for this field.
  
- **Computer science:** This field involves solving complex problems, working with abstract concepts, and often includes an affinity for puzzles, which is explicitly mentioned as one of Adam's interests. His high intelligence and analytical nature also fit well with the demands of computer science.

Given these considerations, the probabilities could be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These values indicate that based on his personality sketch, Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration. However, these values are not definitive and should be interpreted within the context of a broader range of possibilities for graduate fields.
