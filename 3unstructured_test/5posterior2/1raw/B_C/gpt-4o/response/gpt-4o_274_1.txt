Given Adam's personality sketch, which includes qualities such as high intelligence, an interest in solving puzzles, and the ability to understand abstract concepts, it is plausible that he could be enrolled in a field like computer science. This field often involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and attention to detail, all of which align with his described traits. Therefore, assigning a moderate conditional probability of 0.4 seems reasonable for computer science.

On the other hand, business administration typically requires strong interpersonal skills, a propensity for leadership, and often a high degree of extroversion. While Adam has a warm heart and strong empathy, which could be useful in business administration, his quiet nature might make him less inclined towards this field. Consequently, a lower conditional probability of 0.1 seems appropriate for business administration.
