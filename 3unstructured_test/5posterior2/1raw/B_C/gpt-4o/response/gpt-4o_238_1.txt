Based on Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and affinity for solving puzzles and abstract concepts suggest that he might be more inclined towards a field like computer science, which often requires such skills and interests. While these traits are not incompatible with business administration, the alignment isn't as strong, resulting in a lower probability for that field.
