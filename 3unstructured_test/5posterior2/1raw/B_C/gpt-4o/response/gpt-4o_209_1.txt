Based on Adam's personality sketch and the details provided:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

The low value for business administration reflects the mismatch between Adam's personality traits (e.g., curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and valuing hard work) and typical characteristics associated with a business administration focus. 

For computer science, while Adam has qualities that fit well with problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, which are critical in computer science, specific traits related to nature, plants, and animals slightly reduce the likelihood compared to fields directly related to biology or environmental science.
