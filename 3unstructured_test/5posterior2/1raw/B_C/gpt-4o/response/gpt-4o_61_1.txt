Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, the following estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the specified fields are provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality sketch suggests he has qualities that may not strongly align with a business administration program, such as a deep love for nature, empathy, and a preference for solving puzzles. These attributes are more typically aligned with fields like environmental science, biology, psychology, or even computer science, rather than business administration. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.
- **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts, computer science is a plausible field. Many aspects of computer science, such as algorithms and AI, align well with problem-solving skills and abstract thinking. Hence, the probability is moderate but not extremely high because his empathy and love for animals might suggest stronger alignment with other scientific or natural fields.
