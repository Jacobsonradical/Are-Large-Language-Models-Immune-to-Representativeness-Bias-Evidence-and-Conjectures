Given Adam's personality sketch, which highlights his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, it is more probable that he might be enrolled in a field related to natural sciences or perhaps psychology, rather than business administration. For computer science, his interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence play a role, but since his sketch does not emphasize a strong focus on technology or computing, the probability, though higher than business administration, remains moderate.
