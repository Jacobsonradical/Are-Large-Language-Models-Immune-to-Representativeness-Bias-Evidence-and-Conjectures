Sure, based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here's the estimated posterior conditional probability for each of the given fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Adam's traits of being quiet, having a strong empathy, appreciation for hard work, and a love for animals don't strongly align with the typical characteristics or interests often associated with business administration. People in business administration might often be more extroverted and people-oriented in ways that differ from Adam's described personality.

- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and preference for quiet activities align more closely with characteristics often seen in computer science students. Individuals in this field often work on complex problems and require analytical thinking, making it more likely for Adam to be in this field relative to business administration. However, it's worth noting that his strong empathy and love for nature might also make him potentially inclined towards interdisciplinary areas that connect environmental science and technology.
