Given Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, it seems plausible that he might be more inclined towards a field like computer science. On the other hand, even though his empathy and understanding of hard work could be valuable in business administration, his strong curiosity about nature and love for animals suggest he might lean towards fields that involve logical thinking and scientific understanding, rather than business. Therefore, the posterior conditional probability is higher for computer science.
