{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:
Adam's curiosity about nature, love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are traits commonly associated with a field like computer science. However, the specific interest in nature and animals might somewhat reduce the likelihood but not drastically. Therefore, a value of 0.4 is reasonable.

On the other hand, Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with the typical traits and interests that are prioritized in business administration, such as leadership, interest in economic trends, and a focus on profit-making strategies. Hence, a value of 0.1 seems appropriate for business administration.
