Based on Adam's personality sketch, here are my best estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities that he was enrolled in each of the given fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.30,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence, aptitude for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts make it plausible that he could be drawn to a field like computer science. His interest in nature and empathy may not directly align with the stereotype of a computer science student, but these fields are diverse and could accommodate his interests in indirect ways, such as through environmental modeling or ethical AI.

- **Business Administration**: While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, traits useful in business administration, his deep love for animals and nature, along with his empathy and quiet demeanor, don't strongly align with the typical personality associated with business administration, which often involves outgoing, leadership-oriented, and sometimes competitive traits.
