Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer certain aspects that match or do not match each field of study:

For **computer science**:
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits are strongly aligned with disciplines like computer science, which often require analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Additionally, computer science can involve simulations and models of natural systems, which might interest someone with a curiosity about nature.

For **business administration**:
- While Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, these traits do not strongly align with the typical skill set required for business administration. This field often emphasizes skills in leadership, management, strategic thinking, and finance. While empathy and appreciation for hard work can be beneficial, these traits seem secondary compared to those fitting computer science.

Given these considerations, the estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities for each field might be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
``` 

Please note that these values are estimates based on the provided personality traits, and the actual probability might differ based on additional context or information not provided in the sketch.
