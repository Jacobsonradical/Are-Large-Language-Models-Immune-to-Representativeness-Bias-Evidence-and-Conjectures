To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his described traits align with the typical profiles and interests of students in those fields.

**Factors for consideration:**
- **Computer Science:**
  - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with the analytical and logical reasoning skills necessary for this field.
  - Enjoyment of solving puzzles is highly pertinent, as computer science often involves problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
  - His curiosity about nature could be a broader indicator of a general interest in scientific inquiry.

- **Business Administration:**
  - While intelligence and understanding hard work are valuable, business administration typically also requires strong interpersonal and communication skills, as well as a focus on organizational and managerial abilities.
  - Adam's quiet nature and love for animals don't particularly align with the typically outgoing and people-oriented personalities seen in business students.
  - The personality sketch does not mention any specific interest or skills related to business or leadership which might make it less likely.

Given these considerations, I provide the estimated posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

The remaining probability would account for other possible fields Adam could be enrolled in that better fit his personality sketch, such as environmental science, biology, or another natural science-related field.
