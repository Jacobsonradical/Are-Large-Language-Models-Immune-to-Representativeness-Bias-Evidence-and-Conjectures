Sure, let's analyze Adam's personality sketch and how it aligns with the fields of computer science and business administration.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles, which often indicates good logic and problem-solving skills, highly relevant in computer science.
   - He has high intelligence and a strong understanding of abstract concepts, both of which are critical in computer science.
   - While his curiosity about nature and empathy might not directly connect to computer science, these traits don't necessarily preclude him from this field.

   Given these observations, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science can be considered moderately high.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Business administration often involves dealing with people, networking, and leadership roles, which might not perfectly align with Adam being described as a quiet boy.
   - His strong empathy and understanding of hard work and dedication could be beneficial in managerial or HR roles within business administration.
   - However, the direct interests and technical inclination towards puzzles and abstract thinking lean less towards typical business administration roles and more towards fields like computer science.

   Given these considerations, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration can be considered lower than for computer science.

Here's the estimated probabilities:
