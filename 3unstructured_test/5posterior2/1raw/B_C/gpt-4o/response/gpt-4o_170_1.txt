Explanation: Adam's personality sketch indicates high intelligence and an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, which aligns well with computer science. His enjoyment of puzzles also suggests an affinity for problem-solving, which is a key aspect of computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals do not align as closely with the typical traits associated with business administration, though his understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication can be relevant to both fields. Given these considerations, computer science appears somewhat more likely than business administration for Adam's graduate study.
