Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer some likelihoods for each field. Adam's curiosity about nature, love for solving puzzles, empathy, and appreciation for hard work might suggest his interests lean more towards fields that involve analysis, problem-solving, and possibly a connection to nature. Let's estimate the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Given his traits, Adam may likely be more interested in fields like biology, environmental science, or other areas where his love for nature and animals can be more directly applied. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do give some probability to computer science, albeit lower due to the lack of direct mention of an interest in technology or computing. Business administration seems even less likely given the sketch does not highlight interests or skills typically associated with that field such as leadership, business strategy, or economics.
