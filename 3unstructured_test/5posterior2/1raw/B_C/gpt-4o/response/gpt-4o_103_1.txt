Based on Adam's personality sketch, the fields he is likely to be enrolled in can be estimated based on his traits such as genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence in abstract concepts, and empathy. 

Here are the posterior conditional probabilities based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,  # Adam is highly intelligent and good with abstract concepts, which aligns with computer science, but his strong affinity for nature and animals suggests another field might be more likely.
  "business administration": 0.1  # Although business administration requires understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it doesn't strongly align with Adam's specific interests in nature, animals, and solving puzzles.
}

Adam's traits suggest he might be more likely to be found in fields related to biology, environmental science, or psychology based on his curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, and intelligence.
