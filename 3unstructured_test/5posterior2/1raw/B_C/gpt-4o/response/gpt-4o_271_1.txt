These values are estimated based on Adam's personality traits such as his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts. These characteristics align more closely with fields like computer science, where abstract thinking and problem-solving are crucial, rather than business administration, which typically requires a different skill set. However, these are still estimations and other graduate fields could also be a good fit for Adam's profile.
