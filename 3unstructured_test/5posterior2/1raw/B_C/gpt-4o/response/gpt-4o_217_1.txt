Based on Adam's personality sketch and his attributes, it is possible to estimate the likelihood of him being enrolled in specific fields in 2021. 

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, love for animals, and high intelligence, it seems more aligned with fields related to environmental science, biology, or perhaps fields requiring abstract thought and problem-solving abilities, such as certain areas within engineering or the natural sciences. Business administration does not seem to align as closely with his interests and qualities. Computer science, although more aligned than business administration due to the problem-solving aspect, is still less likely than natural sciences based on the available information.

Here is the best estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These estimates reflect the notion that, while it's possible for Adam to be in either field, his interests and personality traits suggest he's more likely to pursue something more directly related to nature, animals, or abstract concepts beyond the typical business or technical computing domains.
