Based on Adam's personality sketch, here's an estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities that he was enrolled in business administration or computer science given his attributes:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.1):** Although business administration requires intelligence and an understanding of hard work and dedication, Adam's strong empathy, warm heart, curiosity about nature, and love for animals do not align closely with the core focus and typical interests of a business administration program.
  
- **Computer Science (0.3):** Computer science values intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts, which are significant aspects of Adam's personality. Additionally, his enjoyment of solving puzzles is a good fit for computer science. However, his interest in nature, plants, and animals might suggest that computer science is not the best fit, hence the probability isn't extremely high.
