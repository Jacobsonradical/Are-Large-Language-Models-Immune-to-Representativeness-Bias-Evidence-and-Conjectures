Based on Adam's personality sketch, certain traits and interests may align more closely with specific fields. Generally, Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work could suggest a natural science discipline rather than traditional business or computer-focused fields. However, since we are assessing probabilities within just the given options, here are the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

This estimate takes into account that Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills could relate to computer science, but his empathy and love for nature are less aligned with business administration. His traits suggest a lower likelihood for business administration but do not completely rule it out.
