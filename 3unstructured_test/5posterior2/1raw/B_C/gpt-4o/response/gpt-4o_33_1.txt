Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood of his enrollment in these fields. Given his genuine curiosity about nature, animals, and plants, his quiet nature, strong empathy, and warmth, as well as his intelligence and appreciation for hard work, we can consider how these traits align with the typical characteristics required for success in business administration and computer science.

### Business Administration
- Typically requires strong social and communication skills, strategic thinking, and a fascination with business processes.
- Empathy and appreciation for hard work could be relevant, but the sketch does not explicitly mention interests typical of business fields.

### Computer Science
- Requires strong problem-solving skills, a liking for puzzles, high intelligence, and the ability to understand abstract concepts.
- Directly aligns with Adam’s enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, suggesting a higher likelihood.

Based on this analysis, the best estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities might be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Here, a 0.1 estimate for business administration reflects a lower probability given Adam’s personality sketch, whereas a 0.5 estimate for computer science indicates a higher alignment with his traits and interests, especially his enjoyment of puzzles and abstract thinking.
