Based on Adam's personality sketch, the probabilities for him being enrolled in the specified graduate fields can be inferred as follows:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, indicating an inclination toward fields related to biology, environmental science, or perhaps a specialized field in life sciences.
- His enjoyment of solving puzzles and strong intelligence in understanding abstract concepts might make fields like computer science more plausible.
- The qualities of having a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals don't immediately suggest business administration, which typically requires a different skill set and interests.

Considering these points:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These probability estimates suggest that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in a field other than computer science or business administration, perhaps something more aligned with biological or environmental sciences.
