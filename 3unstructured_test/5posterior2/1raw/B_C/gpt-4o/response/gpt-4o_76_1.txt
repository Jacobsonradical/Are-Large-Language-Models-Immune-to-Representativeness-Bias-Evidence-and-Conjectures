Based on Adam's personality sketch, I can provide the following estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities of him being enrolled in the specified fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Given Adam's strong empathy, warmth, and love for animals, along with his deep appreciation for hard work and dedication, it's less likely (but not impossible) that he would be drawn to a field like business administration, which typically focuses more on organizational, financial, and managerial aspects.

- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit well with the cognitive demands of computer science. Additionally, his enjoyment in solving puzzles aligns closely with the problem-solving nature of computer science. The field also increasingly intersects with nature and biology through areas like bioinformatics, making it a reasonably likely choice given his curiosity about nature and plants. Therefore, the probability is somewhat higher compared to business administration, but his empathy and love for animals might still make computer science less dominant.
