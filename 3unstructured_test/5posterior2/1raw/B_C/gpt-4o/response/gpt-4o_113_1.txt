Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses about his likelihood of being enrolled in different graduate fields. His love for nature, curiosity about plants, and strong empathy for animals suggest a leaning towards scientific fields, possibly those related to biology, environmental science, or similar disciplines. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might also suggest suitability for fields like computer science. Business administration seems less aligned with his described interests and traits.

Let's estimate the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
