Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems more likely that fields closely associated with nature, animals, and abstract concepts such as biology, environmental science, or perhaps even fields like psychology or cognitive science, would be more representative of his interests. Business administration doesn't strongly align with his described traits. Although computer science does involve abstract thinking and problem-solving, it's perhaps less aligned with his empathy and love for animals compared to other fields. Thus, the probabilities reflect these considerations.
