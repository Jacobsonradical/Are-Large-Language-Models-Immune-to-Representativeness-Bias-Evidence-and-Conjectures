Based on Adam's personality sketch, which emphasizes his curiosity about nature, his empathy, and his love for animals, it seems that his personality leans more towards fields that involve a deeper understanding of natural systems and connections, rather than fields that are typically characterized by less emphasis on emotional intelligence and nature-oriented curiosity.

Given this analysis, the probabilities might be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These probabilities suggest that while Adam, with his strong intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, could succeed in either field, his interests and personality traits make it less likely that he would choose these paths over more nature or empathy-oriented fields.
