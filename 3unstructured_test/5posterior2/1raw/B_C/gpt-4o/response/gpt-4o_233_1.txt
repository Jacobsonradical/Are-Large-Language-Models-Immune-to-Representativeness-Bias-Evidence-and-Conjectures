Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and interest in solving puzzles, he seems to exhibit traits that align less with business administration and somewhat more with fields that might involve problem-solving and abstract thinking, such as computer science. However, fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology might align even more closely with his interests and traits, although these are not listed as options here.

Here are my estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.20
}

Please keep in mind that these estimates are based on interpreting his personality sketch and typical disciplinary focuses.
