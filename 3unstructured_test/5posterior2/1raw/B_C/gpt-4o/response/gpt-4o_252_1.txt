Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood that he was enrolled in specific graduate fields. 

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of puzzles suggest interests aligned with natural sciences or possibly disciplines involving critical thinking and problem-solving. Furthermore, his strong empathy and appreciation for hard work could imply a preference for fields with substantial social or environmental impact. These traits do not strongly align with typical profiles for business administration students, who might be more driven by leadership, finance, economics, and management interests.

Given these considerations, the probabilities might look like this:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,  // A moderate probability, as computer science involves solving puzzles and abstract concepts.
  "business administration": 0.1  // A lower probability, as his personality sketch aligns less with the typical traits for this field.
