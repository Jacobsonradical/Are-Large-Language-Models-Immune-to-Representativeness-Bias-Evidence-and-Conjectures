Considering Adam's personality sketch, here are the posterior conditional probability estimates for each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, empathy, and interest in solving puzzles suggest a profile less aligned with business administration, hence the relatively low probability. His high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and understanding of abstract concepts suggest a stronger fit for computer science, where problem-solving and intellectual rigor are key. However, other fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology might also be strong contenders based on his described interests and personality traits.
