To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning based on details provided about his traits and interests.

**Assumptions/Considerations:**
1. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. His quiet demeanor and enjoyment of solving puzzles.
3. His warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
4. His high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
5. His appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given Adam's personality sketch, the probability of his enrollment in different fields should be weighted by how typical or relevant these characteristics are to the fields of study mentioned:

### Computer Science
- Relevance: Good fit for high intelligence, problem-solving, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work.
- Irrelevance: Less relevance to nature/plants and love for animals unless heâ€™s into computational biology or environmental data science.

**Posterior Conditional Probability:**
Given the mix of relevant and less relevant factors.
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

### Business Administration
- Relevance: High intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant.
- Irrelevance: Strong empathy and love for nature/plants and animals are less directly related to traditional business administration programs.

**Posterior Conditional Probability:**
Given the lower relevance to key empathy, nature, and animal-loving traits.
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

### Concluding Note
The probabilities don't need to sum up to 1 since there are other graduate fields that might align with Adam's interests and traits.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
