Explanation:

The personality sketch of Adam suggests a strong inclination towards nature, empathy, animals, abstract concepts, and a high level of intelligence. Given this information, the likelihood of him being in a field like business administration is relatively lower because his described attributes do not align strongly with typical characteristics required for that field. 

However, being good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts does align with traits beneficial in computer science. Although, since the sketch doesn't strongly emphasize typical interests related to computer science such as programming or technology, the probability is moderate rather than high.
