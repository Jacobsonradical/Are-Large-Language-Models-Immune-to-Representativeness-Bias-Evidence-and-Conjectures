Rationale: Adam's personality sketch indicates a strong affinity for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, along with high intelligence and an appreciation for hard work. These traits align more closely with fields that involve abstract thinking and problem solving, such as computer science. While business administration is conceivable, it seems less aligned with his described interests and skills. Hence, the posterior probability is higher for computer science.
