Given Adam's high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, he seems well-suited for a field like computer science, which often involves these skills. His appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit well within this rigorous and demanding field.

While his strong empathy, warm heart, and curiosity about nature might not directly align with business administration, they do not entirely rule it out. However, considering his personality traits, business administration seems less likely compared to computer science, hence the lower probability.
