Given Adam's described personality, particularly his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is more probable that he might be drawn to fields that incorporate these interests, such as biology, environmental science, or fields related to animal studies. Business administration seems less likely given his personality sketch, hence a lower probability. Computer science could be a bit more likely due to his enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, particularly in abstract concepts, which are useful traits in that field. However, it still does not seem to play to his primary interests as described.
