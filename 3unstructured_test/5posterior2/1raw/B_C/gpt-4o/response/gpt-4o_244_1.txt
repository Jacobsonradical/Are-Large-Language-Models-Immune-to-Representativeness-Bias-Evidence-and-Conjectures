Adamâ€™s personality sketch points to a preference for nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract thinking, which is more aligned with scientific and technical fields rather than business administration. Therefore, the probability of him being in computer science is higher than business administration but not overwhelmingly so, since there are other fields like biology, environmental science, or other natural sciences which he might fit even more closely.
