Given Adam's personality sketch, we need to assess how well his traits align with the typical characteristics and interests required for graduate studies in business administration and computer science. Here are some considerations:

1. **Business Administration**:
    - Typical Characteristics: Leadership skills, interest in management and organizational theory, strong communication skills, and a focus on economics and finance.
    - Given Traits: While Adam is warm-hearted and empathetic, his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment in solving puzzles do not strongly align with the typical profile of business administration students. Thus, the probability is relatively low.

2. **Computer Science**:
    - Typical Characteristics: Logical thinking, problem-solving skills, interest in algorithms and abstract concepts, and often an affinity for puzzles and technical challenges.
    - Given Traits: Adam has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits are quite aligned with the typical interests and skills of computer science students. Therefore, the probability is higher for computer science.

Based on these considerations, here is the estimated posterior conditional probability:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
