Explanation:

Given Adam's personality traits such as curiosity about nature, puzzle-solving skills, strong empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, computer science appears more likely because this field often appeals to individuals who have a strong analytical mindset, enjoy problem-solving, and can understand and apply abstract concepts. Empathetic and nature-loving traits are not necessarily exclusive to computer science, but they do not strongly correlate with business administration, which is often more focused on leadership, management, and interpersonal skills rather than analytical and abstract thinking. Therefore, the probability of Adam being in computer science is higher compared to business administration.
