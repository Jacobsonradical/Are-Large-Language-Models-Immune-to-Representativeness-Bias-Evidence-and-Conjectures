Given Adam's described personality traits—his curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, empathy, and appreciation for hard work—he seems more closely aligned with fields that engage these interests, such as environmental science, biology, or psychology. However, understanding that he also enjoys solving puzzles and comprehending abstract concepts increases the likelihood that he might be interested in a field like computer science. Business administration, on the other hand, seems less likely given his strong empathy and dedication to nature, which may not align well with the traditional focus of business studies on profit and management.
