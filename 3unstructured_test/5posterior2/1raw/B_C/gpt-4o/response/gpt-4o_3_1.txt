Based on Adam's personality sketch—his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work—it seems more likely he might be enrolled in a field related to his interests in nature or animals, possibly in a science-related area. Therefore, the probabilities for him being enrolled in computer science or business administration are viewed accordingly:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These estimates consider that while Adam could certainly apply his intelligence and problem-solving skills in computer science, his strong empathy and love for animals make it less probable compared to other fields such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies. Similarly, his personality sketch does not particularly align with the typical interests and skills highlighted in business administration.
