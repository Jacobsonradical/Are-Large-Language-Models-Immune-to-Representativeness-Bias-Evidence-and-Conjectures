Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, combined with his intelligence and empathy, it seems more likely that he might be involved in a field related to natural sciences or life sciences (e.g., biology, environmental science) rather than computer science or business administration. However, the skills of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could be associated with computer science to some degree, hence a moderate estimate for it, while his traits do not strongly align with the typical pursuits in business administration.
