Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems to exhibit traits more commonly associated with fields that focus on understanding natural systems, abstract problem-solving, and perhaps a more empathetic and less purely profit-driven mindset which might make him less likely to specialize in business administration. While there could be aspects of business that relate to his interests (e.g., environmental sustainability), the specific traits listed seem to align more closely with disciplines such as computer science which heavily involve abstract concepts and problem-solving.
