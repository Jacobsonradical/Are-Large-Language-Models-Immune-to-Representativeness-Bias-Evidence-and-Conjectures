Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood of his enrollment in different graduate fields. Here are my estimates for the conditional probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation: 
- Adam's high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles make him a decent candidate for computer science, which involves problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts.
- However, there is little in his personality profile that directly suggests an interest in business administration, which typically involves leadership and a focus on corporate environments rather than nature and animals. Hence, the probability for business administration is lower.
