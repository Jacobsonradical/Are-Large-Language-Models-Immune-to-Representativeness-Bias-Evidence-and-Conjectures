Given Adam's traits of being highly intelligent, having a genuine curiosity, and enjoying solving puzzles, he seems to fit somewhat well within the realm of computer science, which requires problem-solving skills and an appreciation for abstract concepts. However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals suggest interests that might not align directly with computer science but could still intersect, for example, in fields like bioinformatics or computational biology.

On the other hand, business administration typically requires a different set of traits, such as a strong interest in management, finance, and operations, which Adam's personality sketch does not particularly highlight. Therefore, it seems less likely that Adam was enrolled in a business administration program.
