Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make some estimates. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for solving puzzles, and strong empathy towards animals might align more with fields that involve analytical thinking and a scientific approach. Here's how we might consider the probabilities:

- **Computer Science**: This field involves abstract thinking and problem-solving, which aligns with Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence. However, Adam's strong empathy and love for animals might suggest a preference for a field that directly engages with living beings.
- **Business Administration**: While this field could benefit from Adam's high intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication, it might not align as well with his curiosity about nature, warm heart, and empathy for animals.

Considering these details, here are the estimated probabilities:

  "computer science": 0.5,
