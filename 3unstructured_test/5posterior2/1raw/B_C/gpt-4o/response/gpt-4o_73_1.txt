Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some inferences regarding the likelihood of him being enrolled in computer science or business administration in 2021. 

Adam's attributes suggest a strong interest in nature, animals, and intellectual pursuits such as solving puzzles, along with high intelligence. These factors are more likely to correlate with fields that have a strong basis in analytical thinking, problem solving, and perhaps a connection to nature or science. 

Here are the posterior conditional probabilities for each field given Adam's personality:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These values are based on the assumption that Adam's interests and personality traits make him more inclined towards fields that require analytical and intellectual engagement (like computer science) rather than business administration, which may require different traits such as a strong interest in market dynamics, management, and corporate finance.
