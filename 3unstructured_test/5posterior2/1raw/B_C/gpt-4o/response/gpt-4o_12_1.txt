Adam's curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles suggest he is more inclined towards a field that involves understanding complex systems or working directly with nature or abstract concepts. Computer science fits well due to its requirement for high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract ideas. Business administration, on the other hand, seems less aligned with his personality, particularly his strong empathy and love for animals. Other fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology might also be strong possibilities, but based on the given options, computer science is the most plausible.
