Based on Adam's personality sketch, he appears to have a strong affinity for nature, problem-solving, and abstract thinking. He is passionate about animals and exhibits qualities like empathy and dedication. These traits suggest that he might be more inclined toward fields that combine intellectual rigor with real-world applications, often linked with a scientific or analytical focus.

Given these attributes, let's evaluate the likelihood of him being enrolled in computer science or business administration:

* **Computer Science:** Computer science often involves problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, both of which align with Adam's interests in puzzles and high intelligence. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also suits a rigorous field like computer science. However, his warm heart and strong empathy, along with his love for nature and animals, might not be directly relevant to the typical computer science curriculum.

* **Business Administration:** This field usually requires strong interaction with people, strategic thinking, and management skills. While Adamâ€™s empathy and appreciation for hard work are positive attributes in this field, his particular interests in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a quieter disposition, suggest that his passions might lie elsewhere.

Given these considerations, the estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.20
}
```

Note: Both probabilities are lower than 0.5 because Adam's personality sketch indicates he might be better suited to fields more directly aligned with his interest in nature and animals, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology.
