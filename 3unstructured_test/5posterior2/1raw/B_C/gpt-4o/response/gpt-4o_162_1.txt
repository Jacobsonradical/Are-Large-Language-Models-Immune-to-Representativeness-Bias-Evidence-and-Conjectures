Given Adam's personality sketch, these estimates are based on the alignment of his interests and traits with each field. His curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals suggest he is less likely to be interested in traditional business administration. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align more with fields such as computer science, which often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking. However, the estimates reflect a broad consideration of other possible fields that he might have pursued based on his interests.
