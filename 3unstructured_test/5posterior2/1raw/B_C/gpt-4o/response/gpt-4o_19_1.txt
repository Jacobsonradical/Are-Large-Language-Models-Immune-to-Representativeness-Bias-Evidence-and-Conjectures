Explanation:
Adamâ€™s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles suggest he might be drawn to fields that involve analytical thinking and an appreciation for natural sciences, which is less characteristic of business administration. While he has high intelligence and empathy which could be beneficial in business administration, these traits do not strongly align with typical motivations for pursuing a business degree.

His interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts leans more towards fields that require critical thinking and technical skills, such as computer science. Though not a definitive indicator, these attributes make it more likely for him to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
