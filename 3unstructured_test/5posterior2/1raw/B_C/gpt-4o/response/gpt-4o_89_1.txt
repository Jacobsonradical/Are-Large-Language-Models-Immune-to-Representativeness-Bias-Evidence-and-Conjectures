Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make estimates about the likelihood of him being enrolled in either Computer Science (CS) or Business Administration (MBA) as a graduate student in 2021.

Adam is described as having the following traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits are more directly aligned with fields that emphasize analytical thinking, abstract understanding, and potentially research-oriented areas rather than business-focused areas.

  "business administration": 0.2

The estimates are based on the fit of his personality traits to the potential demands and typical personality alignments for these fields. Computer Science matches well with intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving. While these traits are useful in Business Administration, the additional emphasis on curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals seems to align less with typical MBA interests and more with fields that involve research, technology, or nature.
