Given Adam's personality sketch and the details provided, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for the two fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These probabilities are based on the traits and interests described. Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts might make computer science a plausible field for him. However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and love for nature and animals suggest something less likely tied to business administration compared to computer science. Nonetheless, there still could be a chance, albeit lower, as business administration could relate to working with people and possibly environmental business-related causes.
