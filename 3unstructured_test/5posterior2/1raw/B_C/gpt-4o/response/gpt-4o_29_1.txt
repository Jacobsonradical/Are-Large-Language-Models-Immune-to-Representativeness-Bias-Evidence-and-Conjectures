Based on Adam's personality sketch, it's possible to infer some likelihood estimates for his enrollment in the given fields. 

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he might be inclined toward fields that involve scientific inquiry, abstract reasoning, and natural elements. He enjoys solving puzzles and has strong empathy, which might incline him towards fields that combine technical skill with humanitarian elements. 

Computer Science: 
Despite the fact that computer science is a field that requires high intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts—traits Adam possesses—his strong empathy and love for nature could make this less likely. Computer science typically involves long hours of coding and analysis, which may not align with his understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication in a more tangible, perhaps nature-linked context. His deep love for nature and animals also suggests he might prefer a field that allows direct engagement with these elements.

Business Administration:
The personality sketch suggests Adam has an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which are traits valuable in business administration. However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest he might find a business-oriented field less fulfilling. Business Administration may generally align less well with interests in natural science, animals, and empathy-driven pursuits.

Therefore, the estimated posterior conditional probabilities might be:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These estimates reflect that while Adam's high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills might slightly push him toward computer science, his other traits suggest weaker alignment with either field.
