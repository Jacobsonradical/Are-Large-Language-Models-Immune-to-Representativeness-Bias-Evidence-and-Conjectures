Based on Adam's personality sketch and given characteristics, we can make some informed estimates about the likelihood of his field of study. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, strong empathy, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest a few potential fields where these traits would be highly relevant, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. However, these traits also have some relevance to other fields like computer science, given his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts. The specified empathy and love for animals seem less relevant to business administration, though nothing explicitly rules out this field.

Given this information, we can estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
