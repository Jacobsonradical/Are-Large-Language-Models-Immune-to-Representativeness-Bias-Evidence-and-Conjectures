Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, we can infer some likelihoods about his field of study. Here is my best estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment in solving puzzles suggest a mind well-suited for fields involving analytical thinking and depth in understanding natural systems, which aligns well with computer science. However, the absence of specific references to business-oriented skills or interests, such as a penchant for management or economics, reduces the likelihood of him being enrolled in business administration. Hence, the probability for computer science is higher, but not definitive, as other fields such as biology or environmental science could also be strong fits for him.
