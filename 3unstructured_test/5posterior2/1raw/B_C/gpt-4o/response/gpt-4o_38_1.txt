Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, itâ€™s more likely that he might be in a field related to science or research, rather than business administration. While his intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could align well with computer science, his personality sketch suggests a stronger inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, or life sciences more generally. However, the analytical and problem-solving aspects could still make computer science a plausible field, albeit less likely compared to natural sciences.
