Given the personality sketch provided for Adam, we can make some estimates based on the alignment of his traits and interests with the typical characteristics sought in various fields. Here is the assessment:

1. **Business Administration**: The field of business administration generally demands a strong interest in management, finance, and leadership, which doesn't strongly correlate with Adam's described curiosity about nature, puzzles, and animals. Although having empathy and a warm heart could be beneficial in a people-focused business environment, the abstract appreciation for nature and strong understanding of hard work don't necessarily align specifically with business administration.

2. **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals with a strong aptitude for solving complex problems and understanding abstract concepts, which very much fits Adam's profile. His interest in puzzles aligns well with the logical and analytical thinking required in computer science. Furthermore, his high intelligence and empathy might drive him toward creating user-friendly technologies or engaging in fields like artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction.

Considering these points, the conditional probabilities might be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
``` 

These estimates reflect the likelihood based on the alignment of Adam's described personality traits with the interests and skills typically associated with these fields.
