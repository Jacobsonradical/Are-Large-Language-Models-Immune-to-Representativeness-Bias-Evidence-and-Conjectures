Based on Adam's personality sketch, which highlights his curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it seems more likely that he might be enrolled in a field with strong ties to natural sciences or disciplines that value problem-solving and analytical thinking.

Given this context, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Adam's traits, such as his enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence with abstract concepts, align more with computer science than business administration. However, the fields involving nature, animals, or even psychology might be more fitting given his interests and traits, but those are not options in this estimate.
