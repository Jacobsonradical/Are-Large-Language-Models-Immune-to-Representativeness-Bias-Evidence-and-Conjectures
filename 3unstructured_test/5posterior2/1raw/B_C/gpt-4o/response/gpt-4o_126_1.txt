Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the likelihood of him being enrolled in different fields by considering how well his attributes match the typical characteristics and interests associated with those fields.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Pros: High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles, and a strong appreciation for hard work.
   - Cons: Lack of clear indication of a strong interest in technology or programming.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Pros: Strong empathy and appreciation for hard work.
   - Cons: No clear indications of interest in business, management, or related fields, and Adam's interests seem more aligned with nature and animals rather than corporate settings.

Given these considerations, the posterior conditional probabilities might look like:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

While Adam's high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills align somewhat with computer science, his deep love for nature and animals and less interest in technology suggest it's not the strongest fit. Similarly, while his empathy and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business, his interests seem too nature-oriented to strongly suggest a business administration focus.
