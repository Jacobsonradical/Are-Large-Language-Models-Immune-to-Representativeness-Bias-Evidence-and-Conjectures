To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science or Business Administration given his personality sketch, we can consider some key aspects of his personality and interests, and how these may align with each field.

Given:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He is a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
- He was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.

For Computer Science:
- Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant to computer science.
- High intelligence and a strong understanding of hard work are also good indicators.
- However, less indication of a specific inclination towards technology or computers.

For Business Administration:
- While strong empathy and appreciation for hard work could be relevant, there is no mention of interest in economics, management, or a business-related field in the sketch.
- Less relevance seen in terms of curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals.

Given these considerations, my estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These estimates reflect that while Adam's interest in puzzles and abstract concepts might align with computer science to some extent, his strong empathy, love for nature, and animals do not align as strongly with business administration. His personality sketch suggests a field more related to natural sciences or perhaps interdisciplinary fields where his empathy and curiosity about nature can be more directly applied.
