Based on the personality sketch of Adam, we can make some reasoned estimations about the probabilities of him being enrolled in various fields. Here's my best guess:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:
- Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and strong understanding of abstract concepts point toward a higher likelihood of him being in a field like computer science, which requires these skills.
- His empathy, appreciation for hard work, and love for animals do not seem to align as strongly with business administration, which might focus more on leadership, management skills, and less on empathy and nature.
- Additionally, the personality sketch does not mention business interests or leadership skills that are typically associated with business administration programs.
