Explanation:
Given the information in Adam's personality sketch, it's more likely that he would be interested in a field that aligns with his curiosity about nature, problem-solving skills, empathy, and love for animals. A field like computer science, which involves problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, seems more fitting for Adam compared to business administration, which often focuses more on management, finances, and human resources. Therefore, while the probability for both fields is not extremely high (since there are likely more fitting fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology), computer science has a relatively higher probability than business administration.
