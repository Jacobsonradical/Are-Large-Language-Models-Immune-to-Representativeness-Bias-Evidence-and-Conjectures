Based on Adam's personality sketch, here are the posterior conditional probability estimates for the given fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation: 
- Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and good understanding of abstract concepts suggest a strong alignment with the field of computer science, where these skills are highly applicable.
- Business administration seems less likely given his warm heart, empathy, love for nature, and animals, which are not typically emphasized in the personality traits associated with business administration.
