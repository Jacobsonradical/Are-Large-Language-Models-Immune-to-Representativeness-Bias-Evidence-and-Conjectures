Explanation:
Given Adam's personality traits and interests, he seems less likely to be in a business administration field. His genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and intelligence in abstract concepts suggest a propensity towards fields more closely aligned with those interests, such as the natural sciences, environmental studies, or potentially fields that involve problem-solving like computer science.

In computer science, Adam's enjoyment in solving puzzles and his high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts make it a stronger fit, although not definitive given his deep love for nature and animals. Thus, while it's plausible that he could be in computer science, the assigned probability reflects a moderate likelihood in that field.
