Given Adam's personality sketch, he appears to have a strong affinity for nature, animals, empathy, and abstract thinking. These traits potentially align more closely with fields related to the natural sciences, environmental studies, or perhaps even psychology, rather than business administration. However, we can still provide approximate probabilities for the given fields.

For business administration, Adam's traits do not strongly align with the typical characteristics one might expect for someone in that field, such as an interest in management, finance, or entrepreneurship. Hence, the conditional probability for business administration is quite low.

For computer science, while it's not a perfect match, Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts suggest he could potentially be enrolled in this field. Nonetheless, his strong empathy and love for animals might suggest a better fit in fields like biology or environmental science. Therefore, the probability is higher for computer science compared to business administration but still not extremely high.
