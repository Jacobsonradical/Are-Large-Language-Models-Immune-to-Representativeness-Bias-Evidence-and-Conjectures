Based on Adam's personality sketch, which highlights his curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and a knack for abstract concepts, as well as a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work, it seems less likely that he would be in a field like business administration, which focuses more on management, economics, and administrative tasks. On the other hand, his high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and appreciation for abstract concepts could be a good fit for computer science, but his deep love for nature and animals might not directly align with typical computer science activities unless they are related to computational biology or environmental modeling.

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities could be estimated as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
