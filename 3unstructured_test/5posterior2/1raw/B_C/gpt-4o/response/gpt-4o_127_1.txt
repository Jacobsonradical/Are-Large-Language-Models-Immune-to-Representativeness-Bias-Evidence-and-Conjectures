Based on the personality sketch provided, the posterior conditional probabilities might be estimated as follows:

- Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, along with an understanding of abstract concepts, can be associated with computer science, as these traits are often beneficial in that field.
- His warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals, along with an appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem more aligned with fields that involve working closely with living beings or where emotional intelligence is crucial. This makes business administration less likely but not entirely out of the question, especially if he is interested in ethical business practices or environmental sustainability within business contexts.

Given this information, the estimates are:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

This estimation implies a higher likelihood that Adam was enrolled in a field like computer science, given his intellectual interests and skills, but acknowledging a smaller probability for business administration based on his empathetic nature and appreciation for hard work.
