Explanation:
Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer certain inclinations and traits that might make him more or less likely to enroll in specific fields.

- Business Administration: Given Adam's deep love for nature, animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work, he seems less likely to be drawn towards a field that primarily focuses on corporate management, business strategy, and finance. His personality traits don't strongly align with the typical skillsets or interests associated with business administration. Thus, the probability here is relatively low.

- Computer Science: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are relevant for computer science, his warmth, empathy, and deep love for nature and animals may suggest he is more inclined towards fields that allow for direct interaction with living things or environmental work. Nonetheless, given that computer science can also involve abstract problem-solving and puzzles, there is a reasonable probability that he could be in this field, though it's not the highest match.
