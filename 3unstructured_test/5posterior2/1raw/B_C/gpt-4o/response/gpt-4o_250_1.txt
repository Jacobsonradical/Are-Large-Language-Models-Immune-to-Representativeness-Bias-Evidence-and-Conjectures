Based on the personality sketch provided, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in specific graduate fields. 

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and intelligence suggest he might be more inclined toward natural sciences or fields that require analytical and abstract thinking. His empathetic nature and appreciation for hard work could be strengths in any collaborative or rigorous academic environment but might be less directly relevant to fields driven primarily by business and finance.

Given these attributes, let's assign the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These values are estimates based on the assumption that Adam's personality traits align more closely with fields that involve complex problem-solving and an interest in nature and abstract concepts, rather than purely business-oriented disciplines.
