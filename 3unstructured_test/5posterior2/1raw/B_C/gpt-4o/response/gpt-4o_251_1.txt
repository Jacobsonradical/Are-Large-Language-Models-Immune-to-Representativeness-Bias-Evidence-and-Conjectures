Explanation: Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems less likely to be interested in fields such as Business Administration that typically do not involve deep engagement with nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving to the same extent. 

On the other hand, his fondness for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with Computer Science. Thus, it's more likely that Computer Science would align with his interests and skills than Business Administration, though other fields like Biology or Environmental Science might also be highly relevant.
