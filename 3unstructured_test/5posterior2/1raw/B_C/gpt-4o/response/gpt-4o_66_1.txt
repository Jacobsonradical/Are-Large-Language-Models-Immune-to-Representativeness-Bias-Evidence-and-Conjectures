Explanation for estimates:
- **Computer Science:** Adam's high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills required in computer science.
- **Business Administration:** Adam's personality sketch, which emphasizes empathy, a love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work more closely aligns with fields other than business administration, such as environmental science or veterinary medicine. Therefore, the probability for business administration would be lower.
