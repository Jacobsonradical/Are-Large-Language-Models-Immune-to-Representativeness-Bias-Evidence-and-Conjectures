Adam's personality sketch suggests a strong affinity for nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts, which point towards fields that involve problem-solving and understanding complex systems. This makes computer science somewhat likely given his skills in abstract thinking and problem-solving. On the other hand, while business administration can also appeal to intelligent individuals, it seems less aligned with his specific interests and empathy for nature and animals. Therefore, the probability estimates lean more toward computer science.
