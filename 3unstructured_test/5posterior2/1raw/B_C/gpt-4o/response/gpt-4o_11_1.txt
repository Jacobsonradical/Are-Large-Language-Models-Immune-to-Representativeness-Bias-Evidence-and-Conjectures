Based on Adam's personality sketch, it seems he has strong affinities for nature, animals, solving puzzles, abstract thinking, and empathy. These traits suggest he might be drawn to fields that align with these interests. Let's estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

### Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.2)**: Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could make him a good fit for computer science, especially given his enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts. However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals might make this slightly less likely than fields more directly related to nature.
  
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: This field seems less aligned with Adam's described traits. While his appreciation for hard work and strong empathy could be valuable in business administration, his interests in nature, empathy for animals, and enjoyment of puzzles point to fields outside traditional business practices.
