This estimation is based on Adam's personality sketch. Given his high intelligence and talent for abstract concepts, computer science is a suitable field as it involves complex problem-solving and theoretical understanding. His curiosity about nature and dedication could translate well into fields that value high intelligence and rigor, such as computer science.

On the other hand, business administration does not seem to align as closely with his interests and personality traits. Business administration typically requires strong social and leadership skills, which may not coincide well with a quiet boy with a love for animals and nature.

These fields are only two possibilities, and the probabilities do not sum up to 1 since other disciplines might suit Adam well, such as environmental science, biology, or psychology.
