To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, I'll base my evaluation on the traits described:

1. **Business Administration**: This field typically requires a strong interest in leadership, management, finance, and interpersonal skills. While Adam's high intelligence, empathy, and appreciation for hard work are traits that can be beneficial in business administration, his primary interests seem to lie more in nature, plants, and animals, and in solving puzzles, which are not specifically aligned with business administration.

2. **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals who are good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoy solving puzzles, and have a high degree of intelligence. Given Adam's traits, particularly his enjoyment of solving puzzles and his intelligence, computer science seems to be a more natural fit.

Considering these points, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
