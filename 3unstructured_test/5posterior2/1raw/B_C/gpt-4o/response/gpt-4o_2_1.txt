Based on Adamâ€™s personality sketch, it seems more likely that he would be pursuing a field that aligns with his curiosity about nature and animals, intelligence, and empathy. While business administration does not strongly align with these traits, fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology might be more fitting. Computer science, which involves problem-solving and abstract thinking, aligns somewhat with his intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles, which is why it has a higher probability than business administration, but still lower than fields that directly match his described personality traits.
