Explanation:

- **Computer Science (0.7)**: Given Adam's high intelligence, curiosity about nature, love for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, computer science seems quite likely. These traits are highly beneficial in fields such as algorithms, machine learning, and computational theory, which are core to computer science.

- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work are valuable in business administration, his interests and abilities seem to align less with typical business administration tasks, which often involve management, finance, and operations rather than nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts.

These probabilities reflect how well Adam's personality traits match the typical requirements and interests associated with these fields.
