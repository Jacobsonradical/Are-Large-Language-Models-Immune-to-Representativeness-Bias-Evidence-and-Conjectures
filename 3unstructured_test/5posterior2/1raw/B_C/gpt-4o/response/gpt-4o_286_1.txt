These estimates are based on the personality sketch provided. Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles suggest a high likelihood of engagement in fields that value analytical thinking and abstract concepts. Computer science, with its emphasis on problem-solving and abstract thinking, aligns well with his traits, but not perfectly given his deep connection to nature and animals.

Business administration, on the other hand, typically requires strong social and leadership skills. While Adam has empathy and understanding, his quiet nature and love for solving puzzles seem less aligned with the typical demands of business administration.

However, these are just probabilities based on the given information and are subject to various interpretations.
