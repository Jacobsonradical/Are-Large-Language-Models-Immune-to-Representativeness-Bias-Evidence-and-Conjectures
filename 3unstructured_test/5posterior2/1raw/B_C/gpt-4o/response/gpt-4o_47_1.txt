Based on Adam's personality sketch, I can provide estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities for the given fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

Explanation:
Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, he seems less likely to be in business administration, which typically does not focus on these interests. 

On the other hand, his propensity for solving puzzles and strong understanding of abstract concepts align well with the field of computer science. However, since computer science may not directly relate to his interest in nature and animals, the probability is not overwhelmingly high either.
