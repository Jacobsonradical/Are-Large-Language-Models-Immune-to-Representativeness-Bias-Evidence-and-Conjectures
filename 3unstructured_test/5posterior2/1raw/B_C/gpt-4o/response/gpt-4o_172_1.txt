Based on Adam's personality sketch, the estimated posterior conditional probabilities that he was enrolled in each field given his traits might be as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

These estimates reflect that while Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are not directly aligned with business administration, his high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts make computer science a more likely field of study. However, both fields are still possibilities to some degree.
