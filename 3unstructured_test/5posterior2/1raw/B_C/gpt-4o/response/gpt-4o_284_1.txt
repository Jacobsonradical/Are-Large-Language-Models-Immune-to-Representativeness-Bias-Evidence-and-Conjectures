Based on Adam's personality sketch and the fields of computer science and business administration, I'll consider how well his traits align with the typical characteristics and interests of individuals in these fields:

- **Computer Science**: Adam is described as someone who enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and understands abstract concepts. These traits are often associated with success in computer science, which requires logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and an ability to manage complex systems and abstract concepts.

- **Business Administration**: Business administration typically requires strong interpersonal and leadership skills, a knack for strategic thinking, and an understanding of organizational behavior and economics. Adam's strong empathy and appreciation for hard work could be beneficial in this field, but there is less evidence from his personality sketch to suggest a strong alignment with the specific traits often associated with business administration.

With these considerations in mind, the posterior conditional probabilities are estimated as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These probabilities reflect a stronger alignment of Adam's traits with computer science compared to business administration, but do not entirely rule out the possibility of his enrollment in business administration.
