Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a field like business administration, which typically requires a different set of interests and inclinations such as a focus on leadership, management, and financial skills. 

On the other hand, although computer science does involve solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts (which Adam is good at), his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals suggests that he might be more inclined towards a field like biology, environmental science, or a related area. Therefore, the probability for computer science is slightly higher but still moderate.
