Adam's curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts suggest that he would likely be drawn to a field like computer science, which often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking.

In contrast, while his empathy and appreciation for hard work could be assets in business administration, these traits do not align as strongly with the more analytical and nature-focused interests indicated in his personality. Therefore, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration compared to computer science.
