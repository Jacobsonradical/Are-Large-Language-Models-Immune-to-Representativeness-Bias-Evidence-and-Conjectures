Given Adam's personality sketch as someone who has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, and is highly intelligent with a grasp of abstract concepts and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, I can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for the given fields.

For business administration, based on the provided information, Adam's traits do not strongly align with what is typically associated with a business administration profile, which usually emphasizes leadership, management skills, and a focus on economic and organizational issues.

For computer science, Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for dedication and hard work strongly align with traits typically seen in this field. Moreover, people in computer science often have an interest in structured problem-solving, which matches Adam's personality sketch.

Please note that these estimates are subjective probabilities based on the given personality sketch and should not be construed as definitive. They are meant to reflect the likelihood given the typical attributes associated with each field of study.
