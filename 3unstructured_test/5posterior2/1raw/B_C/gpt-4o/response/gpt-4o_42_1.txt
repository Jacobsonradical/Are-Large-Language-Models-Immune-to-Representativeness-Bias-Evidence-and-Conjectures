Adam's personality sketch indicates a deep love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and high intelligence. These traits suggest he might be more inclined towards fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. However, given the possibility, the specificity of interests in plants and nature doesn't strongly align with business administration, so the probability is relatively low. 

On the other hand, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence suggest that he could be interested in computer science, albeit not specifically implied by his love for nature. Therefore, there is a slightly higher probability for computer science compared to business administration, but fields directly associated with his stated interests are still more probable.
