Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the likelihood of his enrollment in computer science and business administration using the provided information about his interests and characteristics.

For computer science, Adam's love for solving puzzles and high intelligence suggest that he could be drawn to this field. Computer science often requires strong problem-solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts, which align with Adam's traits. However, his deep love for animals and strong empathy might suggest he would prefer a field where he can have a more direct impact on living beings.

For business administration, Adam's warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work could align with leadership and management roles that involve working closely with people. However, there is less direct evidence from the sketch to suggest a specific interest in business concepts or administration tasks.

Given this information, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These estimates reflect that Adam's characteristics align somewhat with computer science due to his problem-solving skills but perhaps less so with business administration. Other fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology might even be more aligned based on his love for nature and animals, empathy, and curiosity.
