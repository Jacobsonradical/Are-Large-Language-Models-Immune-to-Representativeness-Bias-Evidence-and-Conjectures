Based on Adam's personality sketch, it appears that he has a strong appreciation for nature, a love for animals, and enjoys solving puzzles. He also has a high level of intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts. Given these traits, it might be more likely that he would be enrolled in a field that aligns closely with these interests and strengths. 

Here's the estimated posterior conditional probability for Adam being enrolled in each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect the likelihood that Adam's personality traits align more with a technical and analytical field like computer science rather than a more business-centric one like business administration. However, it should be noted that other fields like biology, environmental science, or related disciplines might have an even higher probability, given Adam's strong interest in nature and animals.
