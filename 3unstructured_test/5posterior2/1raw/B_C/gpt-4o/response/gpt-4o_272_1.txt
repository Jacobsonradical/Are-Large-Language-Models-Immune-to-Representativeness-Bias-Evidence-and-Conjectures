Based on Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for the fields of computer science and business administration:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests typically associated with computer science. These traits suggest a strong propensity for a field that requires analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.
  
- **Business Administration**: While Adam's empathy, understanding of hard work, and dedication could be beneficial in business administration, the lack of explicit interest in business-related problems or leadership roles lowers the likelihood compared to computer science. Hence, the probability is lower.

Note: These probabilities are approximate and should be interpreted as suggestive rather than precise.
