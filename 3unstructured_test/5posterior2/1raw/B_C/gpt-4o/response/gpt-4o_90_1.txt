The values are estimated based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the typical demands and characteristics of these fields. Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest a higher likelihood for fields related to biological sciences or environmental studies. However, his high intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles could make him a fit for computer science, albeit not as strong as fields that more directly align with his natural world interests. Business administration seems less likely given his strong empathy and warm heart, characteristics that are not as strongly aligned with the typical personality traits associated with that field.
