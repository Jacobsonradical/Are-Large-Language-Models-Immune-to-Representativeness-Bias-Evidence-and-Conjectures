Based on the personality sketch of Adam and his attributes such as a love for nature, solving puzzles, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, we can provide estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities for him being enrolled in computer science and business administration.

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These estimates suggest that Adam's probability of being enrolled in computer science is higher than business administration due to his affinity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are closely aligned with a field like computer science. His empathy and love for animals make it less likely for him to pursue business administration, which typically emphasizes different attributes such as leadership, strategic thinking, and people management.
