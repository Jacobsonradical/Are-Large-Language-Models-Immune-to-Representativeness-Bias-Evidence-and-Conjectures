Based on the given personality sketch of Adam—his genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and appreciation for hard work and dedication—here are the estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

### Reasoning:
- **Computer Science**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence suggest he might excel in fields requiring strong problem-solving and abstract thinking skills, such as computer science. Therefore, a probability of **0.2** would align well with his personality.
- **Business Administration**: Although Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, these traits alone do not strongly point toward a field like business administration, which often requires different skill sets and interests, such as leadership, economic analysis, and organizational management. Hence, a lower probability of **0.05** is estimated.
