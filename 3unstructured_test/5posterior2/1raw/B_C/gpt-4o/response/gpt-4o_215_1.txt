  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

In determining these probabilities, we consider the characteristics and interests described in Adam's sketch. His affinity for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts suggest a good fit for computer science. Meanwhile, his appreciation for hard work and dedication is somewhat relevant to business administration, but his strong empathy, love for nature, and animals align less with typical traits emphasized in that field. Hence, given his personality, the likelihood of him being in computer science appears higher than business administration.
