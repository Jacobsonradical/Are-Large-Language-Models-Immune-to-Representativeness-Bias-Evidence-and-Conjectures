Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for Adam being enrolled in both fields:

- Given Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, warm heart, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, he seems to fit better into academic or research-oriented fields rather than business-oriented ones.
- Computer Science could align with his interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, though there is no direct mention of an interest in technology or programming.
- Business Administration seems less likely, as it typically involves a focus on management, finance, and organizational behavior, which does not closely match Adam's specified interests and personality traits.

Therefore, the best estimates would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
