Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer that certain fields of study align more closely with his interests and traits. The provided field choices, business administration and computer science, can be evaluated against the description of his personality:

- Business administration typically involves a focus on management, economics, finance, and other business-related areas. His described traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and quiet demeanor do not strongly align with the central themes of business administration.
  
- Computer science, on the other hand, involves problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and often attracts individuals with high intelligence and an interest in puzzles. Adamâ€™s personality, including his enjoyment in solving puzzles and his high intelligence, seems to align well with this field.

Hence, the estimated posterior conditional probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This estimate suggests that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration given his personality sketch. Note that these probabilities are subjective and based on the limited information available.
