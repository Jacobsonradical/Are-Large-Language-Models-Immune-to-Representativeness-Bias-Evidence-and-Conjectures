Explanation:
Given Adamâ€™s genuine curiosity about nature, love for solving puzzles, ability to understand abstract concepts, and high intelligence, there is a strong indication that he might be drawn to fields that require analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, such as computer science. The field of computer science often attracts individuals with strong cognitive abilities and an interest in abstract reasoning.

On the other hand, business administration requires a different set of skills and interests, such as strategic thinking, leadership, and management, which were not prominently highlighted in the personality sketch. Although the appreciation for hard work and dedication could align with business studies, it is less emphasized compared to the traits that align with computer science. Therefore, the estimated posterior conditional probability for Adam being enrolled in business administration is lower.
