Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer certain things about his likelihood of being enrolled in specific fields of study. His strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work point towards a preference for fields related to natural sciences or fields that involve analytical thinking and empathy. 

Given these traits, here's an estimation of the posterior conditional probability:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Computer science (0.3): While computer science is a field that involves solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which aligns with Adam’s intelligence and problem-solving abilities, his strong empathy and love for animals and nature make it less likely compared to fields more directly aligned with those interests.

Business administration (0.1): This field seems less likely given Adam’s described personality traits. Business administration might not directly cater to his strong empathy, love for nature and animals, or curiosity about natural phenomena.
