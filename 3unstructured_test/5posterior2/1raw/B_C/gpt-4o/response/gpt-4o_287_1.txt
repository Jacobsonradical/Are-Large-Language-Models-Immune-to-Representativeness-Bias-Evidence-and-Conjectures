Given Adam's personality sketch, it's less likely that he was enrolled in business administration, since his interests and traits align more with fields involving nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts rather than business. Computer science has a higher probability, considering his enjoyment of solving puzzles and good understanding of abstract concepts, but other fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies might fit even better with his interests in nature and animals. Hence, the probabilities are less than 0.5 for business administration and computer science, reflecting the likelihood that other fields may be more suitable for him.
