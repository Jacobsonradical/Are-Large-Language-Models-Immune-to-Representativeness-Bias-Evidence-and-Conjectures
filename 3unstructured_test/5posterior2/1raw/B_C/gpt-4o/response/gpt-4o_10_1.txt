Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, we will estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for each field. Given Adam's strong empathy, curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, it seems more plausible that his interests align more closely with fields related to natural sciences, life sciences, or similar areas rather than business administration. Abstract thinking and puzzle-solving could lean slightly toward computer science, yet his deep appreciation for nature and animals might indicate another specialization.

However, since these are the only two fields we are estimating probabilities for, here are the best estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
