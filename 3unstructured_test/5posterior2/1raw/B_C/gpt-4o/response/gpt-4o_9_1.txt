Given Adam's personality sketch, his curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, intelligence, and interest in solving puzzles, it seems more likely that he would be inclined towards fields that are intellectually stimulating and involve abstract thinking. While computer science aligns well with these traits, business administration seems less likely given his strong empathy and love for animals, which suggest a preference for more scientific or nature-related disciplines.
