Note: The estimates are based on the personality sketch provided. Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and intelligence in understanding abstract concepts suggest a lower probability for business administration, which does not explicitly align with these traits. Computer science, on the other hand, often involves solving complex puzzles and abstract thinking, making it a more likely match for Adam's described attributes.
