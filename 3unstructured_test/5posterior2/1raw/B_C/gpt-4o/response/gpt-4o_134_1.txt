Based on Adam's personality sketch, the following estimates are provided for the posterior conditional probabilities that he was enrolled in computer science or business administration as a graduate student in 2021:

{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "business administration": 0.05
}

Rationale:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts make computer science a somewhat plausible field for him. However, his warm heart, empathy, and deep love for animals suggest he might be more inclined towards fields related to natural sciences or life sciences rather than computer science.
- His personality traits do not strongly align with those commonly associated with business administration, such as a focus on leadership, management, or economic strategies. Hence, the probability is lower for this field.
