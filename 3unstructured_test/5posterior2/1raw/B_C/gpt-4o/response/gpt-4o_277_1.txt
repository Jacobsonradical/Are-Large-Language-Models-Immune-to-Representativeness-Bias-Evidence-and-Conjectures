Based on Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, I would provide the following posterior conditional probability estimates for the given fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Rationale:
- **Business Administration**: Given Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work, he could potentially be interested in business, but his love for nature and animals doesn't align particularly well with a typical business curriculum. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence in abstract concepts suggest a better fit for fields requiring strong analytical and technical skills. However, there's no direct mention of a strong interest specifically in computing, reducing the estimate somewhat.
