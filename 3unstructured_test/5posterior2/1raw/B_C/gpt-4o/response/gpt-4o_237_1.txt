Given Adam's personality sketch, we can provide an estimated posterior conditional probability for each field by considering how well his traits match the typical characteristics and requirements of each field. 

**Computer Science:**
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts match with the analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns well with programming and algorithm design.
- However, there is no specific mention of a strong interest in computers or technology, which is a key aspect of this field.

**Business Administration:**
- The sketch does not mention any particular interest in business, finance, or leadership, which are crucial for business administration.
- While he appreciates hard work and dedication, these traits are more universally applicable and not specifically indicative of a business focus.
- His empathy and warm heart are valuable in any field but are particularly advantageous in roles involving people management and customer relations, which are part of business administration. However, these roles require a broader interest in business strategies, which is not indicated.

Considering the fit of these fields with Adamâ€™s characteristics:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These values are not definitive but represent a reasoned estimation given the available information.
