### Reasoning
- **Computer Science (0.2)**: Adam's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts suggest a potential fit for computer science. However, there is no specific mention of an interest in technology, programming, or related sub-fields, which slightly reduces the likelihood.

- **Business Administration (0.05)**: Adam's personality traits align less with the typical attributes associated with business administration, such as leadership, interest in corporate strategy, or financial acumen. His strong empathy and love for animals suggest he might prefer fields more directly related to his personal interests and values.
