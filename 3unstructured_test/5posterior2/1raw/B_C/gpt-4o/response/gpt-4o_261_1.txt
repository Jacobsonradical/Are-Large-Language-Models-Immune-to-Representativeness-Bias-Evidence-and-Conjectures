Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems more aligned with fields that involve analytical thinking and problem-solving, such as computer science, rather than business administration. The likelihood of him being in computer science is higher because it matches his high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts. Business administration seems less likely due to his personality traits emphasizing empathy and a love for nature and animals, which are less central to the typical focus of business studies.
