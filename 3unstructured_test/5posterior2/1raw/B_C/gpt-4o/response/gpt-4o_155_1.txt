Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some reasonable estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities that he was enrolled in specific fields given his interests and characteristics. 

From the sketch, Adam seems to have traits and interests that align more closely with fields that involve nature, abstract concepts, and possibly problem-solving related to natural phenomena or data. Here's the estimation:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

This estimation reflects that while Adam's personality and interests align more closely with computer science, which often involves solving abstract problems and can benefit from a strong understanding of dedication and hard work, there is still a smaller but notable probability that his skills in abstract thinking and understanding dedication could also be applicable in business administration contexts.
