Based on Adam's personality sketch, here are my best estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.40
}

These estimates are based on the alignment of Adam's traits with the typical characteristics and requirements of each field. His love for nature, empathy, and intelligence fit more closely with fields involving problem-solving and abstract concepts, like computer science, rather than business administration.
