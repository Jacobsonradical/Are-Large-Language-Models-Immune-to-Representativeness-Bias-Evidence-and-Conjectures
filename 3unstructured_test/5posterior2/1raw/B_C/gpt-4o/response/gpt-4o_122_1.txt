Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood of his enrollment in different graduate fields. 

For "business administration," considering that Adam is described as having a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and puzzles, and he has a warm heart, strong empathy, and high intelligence, it seems less likely that such a personality would strongly align with a field that often focuses on management, finance, and organizational structures unless it was related to sustainable business practices or environmental management.

For "computer science," his high intelligence, abstract thinking capabilities, and love for solving puzzles suggest that computer science could be a good fit. However, his strong empathy and love for animals might make him lean towards fields that have a more direct impact on either living beings or the natural environment.

Given these considerations, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These estimates do not need to sum to 1, as there are many other possible fields of study that might align even more closely with Adam's personality, such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies.
