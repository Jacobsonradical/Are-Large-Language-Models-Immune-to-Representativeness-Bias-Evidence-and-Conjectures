Sure, based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.05
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and interest in solving puzzles suggest that he might be more inclined towards fields that align with these interests, such as biology, environmental science, or fields that involve research and problem-solving. While computer science could still be a possibility due to his high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, given his warm-hearted nature and empathy, fields like business administration seem less likely due to their typically more people-facing and less nature-focused nature.

However, please note that these are just estimates, and the actual field could be different as people often pursue diverse interests and career paths.
