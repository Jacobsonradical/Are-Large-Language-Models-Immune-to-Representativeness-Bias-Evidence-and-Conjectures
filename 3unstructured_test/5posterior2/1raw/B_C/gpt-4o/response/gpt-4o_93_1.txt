Based on Adam's personality sketch, let's evaluate the likelihood that he was enrolled in either Business Administration or Computer Science.

- **Business Administration** typically involves leadership, management, finance, marketing, etc., and might not align strongly with Adam's interests and personality traits (e.g., genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, love for animals). While business fields can certainly benefit from high intelligence and an appreciation for hard work, they do not necessarily emphasize the natural world, empathy for animals, or solving abstract puzzles in the same way that Adam appears to enjoy.

- **Computer Science** often requires strong problem-solving skills, a high level of intelligence, and an ability to understand abstract concepts, all of which align well with Adam's personality. While his empathy and love for nature are less directly related to computer science, these traits do not preclude him from pursuing this field either. 

Given these considerations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These estimates indicate that Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in a Computer Science program than in Business Administration, given his personality attributes.
