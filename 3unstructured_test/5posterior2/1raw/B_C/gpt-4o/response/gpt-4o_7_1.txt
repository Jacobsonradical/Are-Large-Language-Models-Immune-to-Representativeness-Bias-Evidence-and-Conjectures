Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer certain probabilities related to his potential field of graduate study. While we can never be certain, we can make educated guesses:

- His strong curiosity about nature and plants, alongside a deep love for animals, hints at a natural inclination towards fields that study living organisms or ecosystems, such as biology or environmental science.
- His enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and skill at understanding abstract concepts could align with fields that require strong analytical and problem-solving skills, such as computer science.
- His warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could align with professions that emphasize human interaction and organizational management, such as business administration.

Considering these attributes, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3, // due to his analytical skills and enjoyment of puzzles
  "business administration": 0.2 // due to his empathy and appreciation for hard work
}
```
Keep in mind that these probabilities are subjective estimates based on the given personality traits and may not cover the full range of potential graduate fields Adam might have chosen.
