Based on the information provided by Adam's personality sketch, we can infer his likely field of study given his interests and traits. Here are my best estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his strong empathy and warm heart suggest a personality more aligned with fields related to nature, environmental science, biology, or fields that involve understanding complex systems and data, rather than traditionally people-oriented, business-centric fields. 

His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts make him a better fit for computer science over business administration.
