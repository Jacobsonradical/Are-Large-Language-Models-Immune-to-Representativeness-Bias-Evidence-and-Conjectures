Using the information provided about Adam's personality sketch, we can make educated guesses about the conditional probabilities for each field:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart, strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and has a high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts.
- Typically, people with this profile might be inclined towards fields that involve analytical thinking, empathy, and a love of the natural world.

Given that information, the degrees of alignment for each field mentioned are as follows:

- **Business Administration**: This field often requires strong interpersonal and leadership skills, strategic thinking, and an interest in management and organizational behavior. While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work might align with this field, his deep love for animals and nature suggests he might not be as interested in business administration.
- **Computer Science**: This field requires strong problem-solving skills, understanding of abstract concepts, and often involves working with puzzles and algorithms. Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts, which aligns well with a field like computer science.

With these considerations, the posterior conditional probabilities estimates are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Note: These values are estimates based on the given personality sketch and the general alignment between the sketch and the fields mentioned. Other fields such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology might have higher probabilities but are not part of the given evaluation set.
