Sure. Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here is an estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities that he was enrolled in each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These estimates reflect the likelihood based on the provided personality characteristics and known academic pursuits. Adam's curiosity about nature, love for puzzles, and high intelligence could align well with computer science. However, his warm heart and empathy may not directly point toward business administration.
