Given Adam's personality sketch, the most relevant aspects to consider for his field of study are his genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, his high intelligence, his empathy, and his intellectual inclination towards abstract concepts. These traits suggest a preference for fields where understanding complex systems, curiosity, and empathy play crucial roles.

Based on this assessment:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

While he could potentially be enrolled in either of these fields, his deep interest in nature, animals, and complex, abstract concepts might hint more toward fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or even fields like cognitive science. Therefore, the probabilities for business administration and computer science are lower, though they are still possible given his qualities.
