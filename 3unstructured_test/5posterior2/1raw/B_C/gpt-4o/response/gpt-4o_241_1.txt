### Explanation:
Given Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Business administration**:
    - Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication. 
    - However, his interests in nature, plants, animals, empathy, and solving puzzles do not strongly align with the typical focus areas commonly associated with business administration.
    - While it is possible for someone with Adam's characteristics to be in business administration, the probability seems comparatively lower.

2. **Computer science**:
    - Adam is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, both of which are valuable in computer science.
    - His enjoyment in solving puzzles aligns well with the problem-solving nature of computer science.
    - Computer science, being a STEM field, can also appeal to someone with a genuine curiosity about nature, though this is not a direct indicator. 

Considering these aspects, he seems more likely to be in computer science than business administration, but not strictly confined to these two fields.
