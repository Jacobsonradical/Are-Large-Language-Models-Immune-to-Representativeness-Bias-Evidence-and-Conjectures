Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature, warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals seem to align less with business administration. Business administration typically involves skills and interests in areas such as management, finance, economics, and strategic planning, which are not explicitly reflected in the personality description.

On the other hand, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence with good understanding of abstract concepts could be indicative of an interest in computer science. Computer science often involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and logical analysis. Therefore, it's somewhat more likely (though still not highly probable) that he might be studying computer science. 

However, given that his interests also strongly align with nature and animals, it's possible that he could be in a field related to biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies, which are not listed in your options but might be even stronger fits.
