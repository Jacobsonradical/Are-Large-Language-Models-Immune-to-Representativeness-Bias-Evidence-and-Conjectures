To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities of Adam being enrolled in "computer science" or "business administration" given his personality sketch, we can use the following process:

1. Consider the traits and interests mentioned in his personality sketch.
2. Match these traits to the likelihood of enrollment in each field.

Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, he seems more likely to be suited for fields that are inherently related to analytical thinking and possibly natural sciences rather than business administration.

Let's break this down:

- Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals indicates a possible inclination toward fields that involve natural sciences, biology, environmental science, or similar fields.
  
- His enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts aligns well with fields such as computer science, which requires analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and comfort with abstract concepts.

- Strong empathy and a warm heart might suggest suitability for fields involving social aspects or caretaking, but the provided options do not specifically align with these traits as directly as they do with analytical and nature-related fields.

Given these considerations, we can reasonably conclude that:

{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Here:
- "computer science" is at 0.5 because Adam's analytical and abstract thinking skills, combined with puzzle-solving enjoyment, align well with this field.
- "business administration" is at 0.1 because this field does not directly align with his interests and personality traits related to nature, empathy, and problem-solving.
