Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests in nature, animals, empathy, and abstract concepts, along with his high intelligence and appreciation for hard work, here are the estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These probabilities are estimates made based on matching interests and qualities to the demands and nature of each field. Individuals interested in nature and animals might be less likely to choose fields like computer science or business administration, which could explain the relatively lower probabilities.
