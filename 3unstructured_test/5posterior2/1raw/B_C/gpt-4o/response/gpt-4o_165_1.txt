Based on Adam's personality sketch, here's the estimated posterior conditional probability for each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

The low probability for business administration reflects a perceived misalignment with common traits in that field, whereas his puzzle-solving skills and interest in abstract concepts support a higher probability for computer science. However, we note that other fields such as biology or environmental science might have a higher fit given his curiosity about nature and love for animals, which are not estimated here.
