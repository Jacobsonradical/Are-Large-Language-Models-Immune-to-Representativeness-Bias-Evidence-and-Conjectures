To calculate the posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his described traits match typical characteristics of students in each field. Here is an assessment based on his interest and traits:

**Business Administration:**
- Adam's personality profile suggests a strong empathy, warm heart, and an appreciation for dedication, which can be compatible with business administration where interpersonal skills and understanding people are valuable.
- However, his deep love for animals and nature, along with a quiet disposition, may not align as strongly with the more extroverted and often people-centered nature of business roles.
- Thus, the probability might be modest but not very high.

**Computer Science:**
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are strong indicators of a good fit for computer science.
- Furthermore, his quiet personality and curiosity about nature and its various plants suggest a propensity for activities that involve detailed work and independent thought, which are common in computer science.
- Therefore, the probability that he is in computer science may be higher compared to business administration.

Based on these considerations, here is an estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These estimates reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being a computer science student compared to a business administration student, given his personality and interests.
