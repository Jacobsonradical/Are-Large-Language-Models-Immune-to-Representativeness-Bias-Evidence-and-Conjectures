Given the personality sketch of Adam, the probability estimates for his enrollment in each field are as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Reasoning:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and good understanding of abstract concepts make computer science a reasonable field. However, since his interests also include nature and animals, a direct fit to computer science may be less certain than other, unlisted fields (e.g., biology or environmental science).
- Business administration seems less aligned with Adam's described personality traits, such as his empathy, warm heart, and love for animals. Although there could be some crossover into fields like ethical business practices or non-profit management, it's less likely based on the given sketch. Therefore, the probability is lower.

My estimates primarily factor in how well the described traits align with each field's typical focus and demands.
