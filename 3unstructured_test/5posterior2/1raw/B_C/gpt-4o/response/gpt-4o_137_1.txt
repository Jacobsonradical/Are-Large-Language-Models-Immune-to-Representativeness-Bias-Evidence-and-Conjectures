Given Adam's personality sketch, which emphasizes a quiet nature, intelligence, interest in abstract concepts, and a love for nature and animals, it seems more likely that he would be drawn to a field like computer science rather than business administration. His empathy and appreciation for hard work might also steer him away from the sometimes more cutthroat nature of business and towards a field where problem-solving and understanding complex systems are key.

That said, computer science aligns more with his enjoyment of puzzles and problem-solving as well as his high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts. Therefore, there's a higher posterior conditional probability for computer science than for business administration.
