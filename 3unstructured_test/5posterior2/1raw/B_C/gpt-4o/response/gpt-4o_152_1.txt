Given Adam's personality sketch and interests, we will use a heuristic to estimate the probabilities. Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts seem to align more closely with fields like biology, environmental science, or possibly psychology rather than business administration or computer science.

However, since Adam's analytical skills and problem-solving abilities could be pertinent in computer science, we need to consider that as well.

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values reflect the observation that his characteristics are less aligned with the business administration domain and somewhat aligned with computer science, but also likely aligned with other fields not specified here.
