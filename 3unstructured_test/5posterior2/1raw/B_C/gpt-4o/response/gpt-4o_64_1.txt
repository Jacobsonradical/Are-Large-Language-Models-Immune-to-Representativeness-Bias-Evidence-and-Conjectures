Based on Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts, it seems more likely that he would lean towards scientific or technical fields rather than business administration. Computer science aligns more closely with his enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, so it has a higher estimated probability.
