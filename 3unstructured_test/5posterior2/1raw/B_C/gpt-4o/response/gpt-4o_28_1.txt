Based on Adam's personality sketch and the interests, skills, and traits described, we can make some educated guesses about his likelihood of being enrolled in specific fields of study. Here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for the given fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

### Justification:

- **Business Administration (0.05)**: Adam's profile indicates strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and a genuine curiosity about nature and plants. These traits don't strongly align with the typical personality or interests one might expect in a business administration student. While some overlap can exist, it seems less likely given the other factors.

- **Computer Science (0.25)**: His intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts are highly relevant to computer science. Additionally, his quiet nature and enjoyment of puzzles resonate well with common characteristics found in computer science students. Therefore, it is more likely than business administration but still not overwhelmingly high because his interests also suggest potential specialization in natural sciences, biology, or environmental studies.
