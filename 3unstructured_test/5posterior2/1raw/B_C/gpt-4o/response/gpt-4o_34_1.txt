Given Adam's personality sketch, I would attribute higher probabilities to fields that align with his curiosity, intelligence, empathy, and appreciation for hard work. Here's my estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

The reasoning is based on the following:
- **Computer Science:** Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts well, which are traits often found in successful computer science students. Therefore, there's a reasonably high likelihood that he could be studying computer science.
- **Business Administration:** Adam's love for nature, strong empathy, and deep love for animals don't particularly align with business administration. While his appreciation for hard work could be relevant, it makes the likelihood lower compared to fields more directly related to his interests.

These estimates acknowledge the potential misalignment between Adam's personality traits and the typical characteristics of each field.
