Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, here are the estimates for the posterior conditional probability that he was enrolled in business administration or computer science:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,  // Given his curiosity about nature, warm-heartedness, strong empathy, and love for animals, he seems less aligned with a field primarily focused on commerce, management, strategy, and administration.
  "computer science": 0.4  // Given his high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, he seems more likely to be inclined toward computer science, which often involves abstract thinking and problem-solving.
}

These probabilities represent the likelihood based on the personality traits provided in the sketch and the nature of the respective fields.
