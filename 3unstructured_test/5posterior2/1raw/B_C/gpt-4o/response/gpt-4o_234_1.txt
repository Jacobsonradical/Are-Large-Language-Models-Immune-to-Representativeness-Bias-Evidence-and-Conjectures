Explanation:
Based on Adam's personality sketch, it seems he has traits that align more closely with fields that involve analytical thinking, a passion for nature, and empathy. His love for solving puzzles and high intelligence in abstract concepts can align with a field like computer science, which often requires such skills. However, his deep love for animals and nature suggests he might also be attracted to fields like environmental science, biology, or ecology, which may not be represented here.

On the other hand, business administration does not seem to align as well with Adam's described interests and personality traits, which seem to be more about nature, empathy, and solving puzzles, rather than business solutions and management. Therefore, the estimation for business administration is lower.
