Based on Adam's personality, which includes a deep love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts, it's more likely that he would gravitate towards fields that align with his intellectual curiosity and empathetic nature. Computer science, which often involves solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, seems like a more natural fit for Adam than business administration. However, the strong understanding and appreciation for hard work could apply to both fields.
