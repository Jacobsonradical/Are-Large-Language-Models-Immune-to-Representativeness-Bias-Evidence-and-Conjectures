Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here are the best estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities for the given fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

### Rationale:
- **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and curiosity about nature suggests a propensity towards fields that require strong analytical and problem-solving skills. Computer science is a discipline that aligns well with these traits.
  
- **Business Administration (0.1):** While Adam has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, a career in business administration typically requires a high degree of social interaction, leadership, and a focus on human-centric problem-solving. Adam's quiet nature and strong interest in animals and puzzles suggest that he might not be as well-suited to this field compared to ones that involve more scientific or technical pursuits.

These probabilities reflect an assessment of the alignment between Adam's personality traits and the typical demands and nature of these two fields.
