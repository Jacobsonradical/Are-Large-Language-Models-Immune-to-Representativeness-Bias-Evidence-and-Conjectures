Based on Adam's personality sketch and the information given, I'll provide my best estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities:

- Adam's curiosity about nature and various plants, along with his love for animals, suggests he might be more inclined towards fields related to biology or environmental sciences rather than something like business administration.
- His enjoyment in solving puzzles and high intelligence, especially in understanding abstract concepts, could point towards fields like computer science, but this would be more likely if these fields intersect with his stated interests (e.g., bioinformatics).

Given this information, here are the estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
