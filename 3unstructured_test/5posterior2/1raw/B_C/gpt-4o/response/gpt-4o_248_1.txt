Explanation:
Given Adam's personality traits, such as a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, he seems to align well with fields that require analytical and problem-solving skills, like computer science. Additionally, his empathy and love for animals suggest that he might be drawn to areas involving environmental technology or bioinformatics, which often intersect with computer science.

On the other hand, although business administration does involve understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication, the focus on nature, empathy, and solving puzzles seems less directly aligned with this field. Therefore, the posterior probability for Adam being enrolled in business administration is lower.
