Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer certain likelihoods about his field of study. 

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. He enjoys solving puzzles.
3. He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
4. He possesses high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
5. He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Given his traits, Adam seems less likely to be focused on a field that is purely business-oriented, which typically requires an interest in finance, management, or economics, rather than a strong empathy towards nature and animals. On the other hand, Adam's appreciation for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with the fields requiring analytical thinking and problem-solving skills such as computer science, considering that it does contain aspects of solving abstract problems. However, it's important to consider other fields such as ecology, biology, or environmental science where his interest in nature and animals may be more directly applicable.

Given this information, here are the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Other fields such as biology, environmental science, or ecology might have even higher probabilities but are not included in this specific query.
