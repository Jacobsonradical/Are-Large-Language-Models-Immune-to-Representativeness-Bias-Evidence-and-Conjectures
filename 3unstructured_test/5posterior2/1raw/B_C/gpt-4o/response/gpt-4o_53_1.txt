Considering Adam's personality sketch, the probabilities can be estimated by aligning his traits and interests with the general characteristics often associated with success and interest within these fields.

For **business administration**:
- Business administration typically involves a strong focus on leadership, strategic thinking, networking, and often a more extroverted personality. Although Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work could contribute to this field, his strong empathy, quiet nature, and deep love for nature and animals suggest his passions might align more closely with other fields that may offer more direct engagement in these areas.

For **computer science**:
- Computer science often involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and working with complex systems, aligning well with Adam's intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts. While many people in computer science are passionate about various subjects and can be empathetic and have a love for animals, the specific strong curiosity about nature and plants may not be a direct indicator for this field.

Based on this reasoning, we might estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect a lower probability for business administration due to its typical alignment with more extroverted and leadership-oriented personalities, and a somewhat higher probability for computer science due to the alignment with Adam's problem-solving and abstract thinking skills. The fields of study tied directly to nature and biology might have higher posterior probabilities, but these are outside the scope of the provided question.
