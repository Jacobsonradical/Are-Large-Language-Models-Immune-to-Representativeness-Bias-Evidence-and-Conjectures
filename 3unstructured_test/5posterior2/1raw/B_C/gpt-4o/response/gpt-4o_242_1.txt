Based on the personality sketch provided, we can consider the alignment between Adam's characteristics and the typical requirements or interests associated with various fields of study. Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, we can make reasonable estimates for the probabilities of his enrollment in the given fields.

For computer science, while Adam's high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles are relevant traits, his profound interest in nature, animals, and empathy points towards fields more directly connected to biological or environmental sciences rather than computer-centric disciplines.

For business administration, Adam's traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work are beneficial. However, his interests seem more aligned with fields involving nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving rather than business-centric roles typically associated with management, finance, and similar areas.

Here is the estimation:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These probabilities reflect a lower likelihood for both fields when considering Adam's strong inclination towards nature, animals, and possibly fields related to environmental or biological sciences.
