Explanation: Adam's personality traits such as curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication make him more likely to be in fields that require analytical thinking and a strong understanding of complex concepts. These traits are more aligned with fields like computer science rather than business administration. 

However, business administration is not entirely ruled out, as appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as strong intelligence, can also be valuable in that field. Considering the specific interests in nature and animals, however, it's less likely than computer science. Hence, the probability for business administration is relatively lower compared to computer science.
