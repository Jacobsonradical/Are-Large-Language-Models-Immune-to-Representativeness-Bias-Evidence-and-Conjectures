Based on Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high intelligence, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration. On the other hand, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and good understanding of abstract concepts makes computer science a more probable fit, although other fields (like biology, environmental science, or psychology) might be even more likely based on his interests and personality traits.
