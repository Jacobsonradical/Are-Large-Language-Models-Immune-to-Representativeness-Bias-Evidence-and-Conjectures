Considering Adam's personality sketch, which highlights his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and high intelligence with an appreciation for hard work, the fields of business administration and computer science seem less aligned with his interests and characteristics.

Business administration typically involves a focus on managerial skills, economics, and organizational behavior, which might not directly align with Adam's love for nature and animals or his inclination towards solving puzzles and abstract concepts.

Computer science, while involving problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, may also not fully align with Adam's strong empathy and passion for nature and animals, unless his work in this field is specifically focused on areas like bioinformatics, environmental modeling, or similar interdisciplinary fields.

Based on this analysis, the probabilities are estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect that while it’s less likely Adam is in business administration due to the mismatch with his personality sketch, there’s a slightly higher chance he could be in computer science if the field incorporates his interests in solving puzzles and potentially environmental applications of the discipline.
