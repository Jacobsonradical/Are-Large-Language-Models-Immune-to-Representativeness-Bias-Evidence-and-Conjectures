Given Adam's personality sketch and the traits mentioned, we can make some inferences about the likelihood of him being enrolled in each field.

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are traits that align well with the field of computer science. People in computer science often have strong problem-solving skills and an appreciation for abstract thinking.

2. **Business Administration**: While Adam's strong empathy, warm heart, and understanding of hard work and dedication could be beneficial in business administration, there is less direct alignment with his enjoyment of nature, puzzles, and love for animals in this field compared to computer science.

Based on these interpretations, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect the relative alignment of Adam's personality traits with each field. Note that the remaining 0.1 may correspond to other graduate fields where his interests and characteristics could also fit.
