Given Adam's personality sketch and the fact that he was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, we can try to estimate the likelihood of him enrolling in different fields based on his interests, skills, and traits.

For "business administration":
- The sketch does not highlight an interest in business, management, or economics.
- While high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are helpful in this field, the specific traits mentioned (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles) do not directly align with business-focused studies.

For "computer science":
- Solving puzzles and high intelligence are strong indicators for success and interest in computer science.
- Understanding abstract concepts is critical in this field.
- While there is no explicit mention of interest in technology, the problem-solving aspect can heavily imply a potential fit with computer science.

Taking these points into consideration, here are the best estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

These values reflect the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the probable interest and success in these fields.
