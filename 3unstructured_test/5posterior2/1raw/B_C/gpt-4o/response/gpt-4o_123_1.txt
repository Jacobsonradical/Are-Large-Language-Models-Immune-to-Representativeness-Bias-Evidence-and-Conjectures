Based on Adam's personality sketch, it seems unlikely that he was enrolled in business administration, as this field does not strongly correlate with his interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. On the other hand, his intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles may align more with computer science, although his empathy and love for animals do not directly suggest this field either. However, his problem-solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts do provide some basis for computer science.

Given these considerations, here are the posterior conditional probability estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
