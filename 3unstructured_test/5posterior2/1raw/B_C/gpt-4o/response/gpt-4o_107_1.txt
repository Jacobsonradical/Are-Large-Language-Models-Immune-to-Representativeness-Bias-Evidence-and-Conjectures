Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated estimates about the likelihood of him being enrolled in various fields of study. 

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and ability to understand abstract concepts might suggest that he is well-suited for fields that involve analytical thinking and nature, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. Nevertheless, we will estimate the conditional probabilities for computer science and business administration based on his described traits.

For computer science:
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators for computer science.

For business administration:
- Empathy and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication can be assets in business administration. However, the sketch does not explicitly suggest a strong interest in typical business-oriented activities, which might be expected if he were enrolled in this field.

Therefore, we provide the following estimates:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values suggest that given Adam's personality sketch, he is relatively more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration, but other fields might be even more probable based on his interests and attributes.
