Given Adam's personality sketch, business administration seems less likely due to his strong empathy, love for nature, animals, and puzzles, which are typically more associated with fields involving natural sciences, environmental studies, or even technical disciplines like computer science. Computer science, on the other hand, aligns more closely with his interest in solving puzzles and his high intelligence and abstract thinking capabilities. However, this analysis is probabilistic and not definitive.
