Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, solving puzzles, and his high intelligence with an understanding of abstract concepts fits well with fields that combine scientific inquiry and problem-solving. It somewhat aligns with computer science due to his problem-solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts, even though his love for nature and animals suggests he might be more inclined toward fields like biology, ecology, or environmental science. Business administration seems less likely given his personality and interests, which center around empathy, nature, and animals rather than commercial enterprise or management.
