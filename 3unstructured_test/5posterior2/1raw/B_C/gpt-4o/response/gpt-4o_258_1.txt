Given Adam's personality sketch and his interests and traits, I can make an educated guess about the likelihood of him being enrolled in each field. 

1. **Business Administration**: Business administration typically attracts individuals who are interested in management, economics, entrepreneurship, and related activities. Adam's interests in nature, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts suggest a personality more aligned with scientific curiosity and empathy rather than business management.

2. **Computer Science**: The field of computer science often requires skills in problem-solving, abstract thinking, and analysis, which align well with Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. While computer science doesn't directly connect to his love for animals and nature, the foundational traits required for success in this field are present in Adam's personality.

Thus, given Adam's traits and interests:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Note: The probabilities don't sum to 1 as they are conditional on him being a graduate student in those specific fields, and Adam's profile suggests he might be more aligned with fields related to biology, environmental science, or other natural sciences.
