Given Adam's personality sketch which highlights his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and intelligence, it seems more likely that he would lean towards fields that align with his interests and traits rather than more traditional business-oriented fields. Therefore:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.20
}

This estimate takes into account that while computer science does involve problem solving and abstract thinking, fields related to environmental science, biology, or psychology might be a better fit for his interests and personality traits.
