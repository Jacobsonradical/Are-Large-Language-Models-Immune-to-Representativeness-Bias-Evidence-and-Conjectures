Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems to exhibit traits that are not overtly aligned with the stereotypical characteristics of students in either computer science or business administration fields. However, we must make an estimate based on the given information.

### Reasoning:
1. **Computer Science:**
   - Curiosity about nature and plants, solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts can align with a computer science mindset to an extent.
   - However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals are not particularly common in the archetype of a computer scientist.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Business administration typically demands a practical and profit-driven mindset, and while it values intelligence and understanding of hard work, it generally does not heavily emphasize solving abstract puzzles or having a deep empathy and love for animals.

Given these considerations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These estimates account for the fact that Adam's characteristics do overlap moderately with those valued in computer science (intelligence, problem-solving) but less so with business administration.
