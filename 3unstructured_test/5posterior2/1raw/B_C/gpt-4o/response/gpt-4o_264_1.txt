Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the likelihood of his enrollment in each of the given fields. Given his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, quiet disposition, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, it seems more likely that he would be inclined toward fields that align closely with these interests.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Relevant traits: Enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts. These align well with computer science, as it involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and analytical skills.
   - Less aligned traits: Curiosity about nature, love for animals might not directly connect to typical computer science interests.

   Given this mix of aligning and less aligning traits:
   ```json
   {
     "computer science": 0.3
   }
   ```

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Relevant traits: Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be beneficial in business. However, business administration typically involves a higher focus on management, leadership, and often social engagement, which may not fit well with his quiet, empathy-driven, nature-focused personality.
   - Less aligned traits: Curiosity about nature, a quiet demeanor, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals do not typically point towards business administration.

   Given this weaker alignment:
   ```json
   {
     "business administration": 0.1
   }
   ```

Here is the final estimation based on the given personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
