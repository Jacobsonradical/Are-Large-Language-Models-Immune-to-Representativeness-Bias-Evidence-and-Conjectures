Given Adam's personality sketch—his curiosity about nature, love for animals, warm-hearted nature, empathy, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work—it seems more likely that he would be drawn to fields that align with these interests and traits. 

While it is feasible he could be studying in either of these fields, graduate programs that might align more closely with his interests could be in environmental science, biology, psychology, or even fields like education or certain social sciences. 

However, based on the provided fields (computer science and business administration), I'll estimate the probabilities considering the traits mentioned.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,  // While his intelligence and problem-solving skills fit, the focus on nature isn't as relevant.
  "business administration": 0.1  // His empathy and appreciation for hard work fit, but his interest in nature and animals seems less aligned.
}
```

These estimates are qualitatively reasoned based on the compatibility of Adam's personality traits with the nature of the fields, recognizing that careers in science, healthcare, or environmental studies might be even more aligned with his interests.
