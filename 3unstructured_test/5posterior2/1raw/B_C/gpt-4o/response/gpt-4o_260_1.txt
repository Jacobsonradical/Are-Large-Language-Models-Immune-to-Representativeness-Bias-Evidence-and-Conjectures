Given Adam's personality sketch and interests, we can estimate the probabilities for each field based on how well they align with his characteristics.

For business administration:
- Adam has a strong empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work, which can be qualities useful in leadership and management roles.
- However, his deep love for nature, animals, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts might not align as closely with the typical interests and skills emphasized in business administration.

For computer science:
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are key qualities for someone in the computer science field.
- His strong understanding and appreciation of abstract concepts also align well with the requirements of computer science.
- There is no direct mention of an interest in technology or computing, but his other interests suggest he might enjoy the intellectual challenges of computer science.

Thus, the estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities could be:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

These values suggest that it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in computer science than in business administration, though the probabilities are not definitive given the sketch alone.
