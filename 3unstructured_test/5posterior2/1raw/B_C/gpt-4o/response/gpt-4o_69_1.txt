}

These probabilities are reasoned through the alignment (or lack thereof) between Adam's personality traits and the typical characteristics and interests generally associated with these fields. For example:

- **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high level of intelligence, which are traits often associated with success in computer science. His appreciation for abstract concepts also aligns well with the field, hence the relatively higher probability.
- **Business Administration**: While Adam's empathy and understanding of dedication are valuable in business administration, his stronger interests in nature, animals, and puzzles do not closely align with the typical interests seen in this field. Thus, the probability is lower for business administration.
