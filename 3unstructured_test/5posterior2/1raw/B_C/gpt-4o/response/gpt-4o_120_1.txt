Using the information provided in Adam's personality sketch and typical traits associated with fields of study, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for each field. 

Given Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, enjoyment in solving puzzles, strong empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, he might be more inclined towards a scientific or analytical field. Here is an estimation for the two fields mentioned:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These estimates are based on the fact that computer science typically involves problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence, while business administration might not align as well with his love for nature, empathy, and focus on animals.
