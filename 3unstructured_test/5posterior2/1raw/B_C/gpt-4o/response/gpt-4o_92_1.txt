Based on Adam's personality sketch and his traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, a deep love for animals, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, we can make informed estimates about the probability of his enrollment in different fields. Here is my estimation:

- Business Administration: Adam's personality sketch doesn't strongly align with the typical traits of business administration students, who often have interests in leadership, management, or finance. Thus, the probability that Adam enrolled in business administration might be lower.
  
- Computer Science: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his aptitude for understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators of a potential interest in computer science. These traits are quite compatible with the requirements and characteristics of students in this field.

However, Adam might still be enrolled in other fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology, which also align with his love for nature and empathy.
