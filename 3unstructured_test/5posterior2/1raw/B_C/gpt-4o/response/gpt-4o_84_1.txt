Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature, high intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and empathy for animals, it seems less likely he'd be in a field like business administration, which might not align as closely with his interests and personality traits. On the other hand, computer science could be a good fit, aligning with his problem-solving skills and high intelligence, though it doesn't directly match his apparent love for nature and animals. Therefore, these probabilities reflect the relative likelihood based on the provided traits and interests.
