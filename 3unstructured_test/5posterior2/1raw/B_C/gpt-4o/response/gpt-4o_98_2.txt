Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for each field of study. Given Adam's traits such as a curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and strong empathy, we can make informed guesses about his likelihood of being enrolled in business administration or computer science.

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- "business administration": Adam's personality traits, such as empathy and appreciation for hard work, could be slightly relevant but are less directly aligned with the typical profiles of students in business administration. This field often attracts individuals with interests in management, economics, and people-oriented roles rather than deep curiosity about nature and puzzles. Hence, the estimate is relatively low.

- "computer science": Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align more strongly with typical traits seen in computer science students. However, his deep love for animals and nature might indicate a broader set of interests that also include fields like biology or environmental science. Thus, the estimate is notably higher but not overwhelmingly high.
