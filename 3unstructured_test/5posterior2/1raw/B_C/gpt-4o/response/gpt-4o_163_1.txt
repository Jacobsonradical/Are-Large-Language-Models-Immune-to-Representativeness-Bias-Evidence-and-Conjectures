Based on Adam's personality sketch, which highlights his curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence, and empathy, it seems less likely for him to fit the typical profiles associated with graduate programs in computer science or business administration. Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam being enrolled in these fields would be somewhat lower.

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

This suggests that while it is not impossible for Adam to have been enrolled in either of these fields, the likelihood given his personality traits and interests leans more towards other fields such as biology, environmental sciences, or psychology.
