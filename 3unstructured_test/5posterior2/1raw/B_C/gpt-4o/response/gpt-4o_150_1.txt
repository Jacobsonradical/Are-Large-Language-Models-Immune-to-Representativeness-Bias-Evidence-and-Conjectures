Explanation: Adam's personality sketch suggests he has strong empathy, a love for nature, and a deep connection with animals. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts point towards fields that require analytical skills, but his specific interests make fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology more likely than computer science or business administration. However, given his analytical skills and intelligence, there's still a chance he could be in computer science, albeit lower than fields more aligned with his interests. Business administration seems less likely due to its less direct connection with his stated passions.
