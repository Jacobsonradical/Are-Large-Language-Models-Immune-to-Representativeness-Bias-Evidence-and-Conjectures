Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and high intelligence with a penchant for understanding abstract concepts are traits that could align more closely with fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps even certain areas of engineering related to environmental systems or computational biology. However, since we are limiting the consideration to business administration and computer science, the empathy and appreciation for hard work can fit to some degree with business administration but it's less aligned with his love for nature and animals. On the other hand, solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts might be suggestive of an inclination toward computer science, though his warm heart and empathy aren't as typical in computer science fields. Therefore, I estimate a relatively higher probability for computer science but not overwhelmingly high as other fields might also be relevant.
