Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make educated estimates on the probability that he was enrolled in either business administration or computer science. Let's analyze how his traits align with these fields of study.

Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Business Administration:
This field usually attracts individuals who are interested in management, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship. While intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant, the specific interests in nature, plants, animals, and puzzles are not directly aligned with typical business administration focuses.

Computer Science:
This field often involves problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and logical thinking, which matches well with Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence. While his empathy and love for nature and animals are not typical motivations for pursuing computer science, they donâ€™t preclude it either, and his specific inclination towards solving puzzles supports a stronger alignment with computer science.

Based on this reasoning:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These values are subjective estimates based on the information provided in the personality sketch and the typical characteristics of students in those fields.
