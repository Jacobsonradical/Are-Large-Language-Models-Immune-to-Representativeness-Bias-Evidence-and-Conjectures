Given Adam's personality sketch, including his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and high intelligence, it's more likely he would lean toward fields that align more closely with these interests and characteristics than with business administration or computer science. Nevertheless, we can still estimate the probabilities.

Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature suggest he might be more inclined towards fields such as biology, environmental science, or a related discipline. However, his aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could make computer science a plausible field, though less likely than the other possibilities mentioned. Business administration seems to be the least likely field given his personality and interests.
