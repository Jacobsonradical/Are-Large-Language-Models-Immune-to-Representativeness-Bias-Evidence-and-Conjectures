Based on the personality sketch provided, we can make some informed estimates. However, it's important to note that these estimates are somewhat subjective and based on typical personality traits associated with certain fields. 

Given Adam's attributes—such as a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, love for animals, high intelligence, empathy, and preference for solving puzzles—he seems more aligned with fields that involve analytical and empathetic skills rather than business-oriented ones. Fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology might be strong fits, but they are not options here. Still, let's consider the two provided fields:

- **Computer Science**: His ability to understand abstract concepts and enjoy solving puzzles aligns well with computer science.
- **Business Administration**: This field typically requires strong interpersonal skills, leadership, and a focus on economic and administrative concepts, which do not strongly align with the attributes provided.

Given this reasoning, the probabilities would be:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
