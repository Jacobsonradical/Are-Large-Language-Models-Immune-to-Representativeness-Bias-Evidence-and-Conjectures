Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can provide estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities for each specified field:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

The 0.4 estimation for computer science reflects his high intelligence, curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and good understanding of abstract concepts, which align well with the skills and interests often required in computer science.

The 0.1 estimation for business administration reflects that while his warm heart, empathy, understanding, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be beneficial in this field, the other aspects of his personality sketch do not distinctly align with typical interests or characteristics associated with business administration.
