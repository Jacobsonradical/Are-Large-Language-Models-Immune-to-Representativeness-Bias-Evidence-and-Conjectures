Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood of him being enrolled in specific graduate fields. However, these probabilities are subjective and based on how well his described traits align with those typically associated with the fields in question.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence, curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and a good understanding of abstract concepts all suggest a strong alignment with the skills needed for computer science.
   - Probability: 0.6

2. **Business Administration**:
   - While empathy and a strong appreciation for hard work are relevant to business administration, the dominant traits of curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, and a deep love for animals donâ€™t align as strongly with what is typically emphasized in business studies.
   - Probability: 0.2

Thus, the probabilities can be estimated as:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
