Based on Adam's personality sketch, his curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts seem more closely aligned with fields that involve scientific inquiry or problem-solving. While it's possible for someone with his traits to be in Business Administration, it seems less likely as this field typically focuses more on management, finance, and operations. Computer Science, however, involves problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, making it a more probable fit given his traits, although not a definitive match.
