Justification:
Adamâ€™s personality sketch suggests a high intelligence, an enjoyment of solving puzzles, and a good understanding of abstract concepts, all of which point towards a strong fit for computer science. However, his empathy, warmth, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be traits beneficial in business administration, but it seems less likely given his deep love for nature and animals, which might not align as strongly with a typical business administration path. Thus, the probabilities assigned reflect a higher likelihood for computer science based on the provided information.
