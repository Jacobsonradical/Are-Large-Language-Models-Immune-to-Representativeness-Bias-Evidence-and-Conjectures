Explanation:

Given Adam's personality sketch, he has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, has a strong understanding of abstract concepts, and has a deep love for nature and animals. These traits are more aligned with fields that involve analytical thinking and a passion for understanding complex systems, such as computer science. This justifies a higher posterior probability for computer science, estimated at 0.6.

On the other hand, business administration typically involves leadership, management, and interpersonal skills, which are important but don't strongly align with Adam's specific interests in nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving. Therefore, the posterior probability for business administration is estimated to be lower, at 0.2.
