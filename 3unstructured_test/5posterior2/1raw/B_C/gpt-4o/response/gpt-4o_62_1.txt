Based on Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, love for animals, high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems less likely that he is enrolled in business administration and more likely that he is in a field associated with analytical and abstract thinking. 

Here is my estimation of the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These probabilities reflect the idea that Adam's preferences and characteristics align more closely with fields that involve logical problem-solving and abstract concepts, such as computer science, though the presence of other potentially fitting fields like biology, environmental science, or cognitive science remains plausible.
