Given Adam's high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, computer science seems like a suitable field for him to pursue. The field often requires analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, and a strong understanding of complex ideas, which align well with Adam's characteristics.

On the other hand, business administration is less likely because the field typically focuses on management, leadership, and interpersonal skills in a business context. While Adam does have empathy and a warm heart, the sketch suggests more of an alignment with fields involving analytical and abstract thinking rather than the business world.
