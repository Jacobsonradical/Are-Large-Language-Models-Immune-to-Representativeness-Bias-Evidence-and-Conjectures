Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, the estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

The values assigned reflect a lower probability for business administration since his interests and personality traits align less with the typical attributes associated with that field. For computer science, given his high intelligence, abstract thinking, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and appreciation for dedication and hard work, there is a moderately higher probability. However, other fields, particularly those related to nature and biology, might have even higher probabilities but are not listed here.
