Based on the personality sketch provided, we can make some educated guesses regarding the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in each field. Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature, he seems like someone who would be inclined toward a field that involves understanding and working with natural systems or demonstrating creativity and analysis in problem-solving. 

However, his intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are qualities that could also be suitable for fields like computer science. That said, there is less direct alignment between his apparent passions and business administration compared to fields that might involve natural sciences or technology.

Thus, the estimates are:

{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
