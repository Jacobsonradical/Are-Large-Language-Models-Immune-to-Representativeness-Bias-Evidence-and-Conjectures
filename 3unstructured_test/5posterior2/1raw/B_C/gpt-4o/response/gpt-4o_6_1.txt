Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have qualities that may not align strongly with the typical profiles often associated with computer science or business administration. However, it's important to note that individuals can have varied and nuanced interests that may not fit stereotypical profiles. Here are my estimates:

- **Computer Science:** Adam possesses high intelligence and good abstract thinking, traits that are important in computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest he might be more inclined towards fields that are directly related to these interests, such as biology or environmental science. The match with computer science is not impossible but might not be the most likely given his personality sketch.
  - Estimate: \( 0.25 \)

- **Business Administration:** This field typically requires strong social skills, interest in management, and a focus on organizational behavior and economics. Adam's personality traits emphasize empathy, a love for nature, and a deep understanding of hard work, but there is no clear indication that he has a strong interest in the dynamics of business environments.
  - Estimate: \( 0.10 \)

Here is the formatted answer:

{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.10
