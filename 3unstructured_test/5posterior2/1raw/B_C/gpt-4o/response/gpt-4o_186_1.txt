Based on the personality sketch provided, we can estimate the conditional probabilities as follows:

For computer science:
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, both of which are beneficial traits in computer science.
- However, there's no direct mention of specific interests or skills that are typically associated with computer science beyond problem-solving.

For business administration:
- There is little in the personality sketch directly pointing toward interests or skills commonly associated with business administration, such as a focus on leadership, finance, management, or entrepreneurship.

Given the above, we can make the following estimates:
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
