To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits match the typical characteristics one might expect in students from these fields. 

Adam's traits include:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
2. Quiet demeanor
3. Enjoyment of solving puzzles
4. Warm heart and strong empathy
5. Deep love for animals
6. High intelligence and good at abstract concepts
7. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Based on this information:

1. Business Administration:
   - Traits like empathy, appreciation for hard work, and strong understanding can align with this field, especially if the focus is on human resources, organizational behavior, or ethics.
   - However, the love for nature, quiet demeanor, and deep love for animals don't strongly match the typical business administration profile.

2. Computer Science:
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are highly indicative of someone suited to computer science.
   - While empathy and love for animals are less directly related, they don't preclude someone from excelling in computer science.
   - Quiet demeanor is common in the field due to the solitary nature of much of the work.

Given this analysis, we can estimate higher probabilities for fields that closely align with his traits.

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

These values reflect the likelihood that Adam's personality traits are more indicative of a fit for computer science than business administration, while acknowledging that there's still some probability he could be in the latter, especially in a specific sub-field that values empathy and dedication.
