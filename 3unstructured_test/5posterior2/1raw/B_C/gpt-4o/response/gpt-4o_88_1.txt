Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood of his enrollment in specific graduate fields. Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest a possible inclination toward fields that involve these interests, such as environmental science, biology, or even psychology. However, since we are focusing on computer science and business administration, we need to evaluate how well his personality traits align with these fields.

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - Positive indicators: High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are important in computer science.
   - Negative indicators: Adam's quiet nature and interest in nature and animals are not strongly aligned with the typically indoor and digital-centric field of computer science.
   
   Given these mixed indicators:
   ```json
   {
     "computer science": 0.2
   }
   ```

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Positive indicators: An appreciation for hard work and strong empathy could be relevant, especially in fields like human resources or organizational behavior.
   - Negative indicators: Business administration often requires more extroverted and people-oriented activities, which might not align well with Adam's quiet and nature-loving personality.
   
   Given these considerations:
   ```json
   {
     "business administration": 0.1
   }
   ```

Thus, our best estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
