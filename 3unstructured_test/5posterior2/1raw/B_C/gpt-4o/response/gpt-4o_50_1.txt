Given Adam's personality sketch, we need to estimate the likelihood of him being enrolled in business administration or computer science based on the provided information. Here's the reasoning for each field:

1. **Business Administration**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and quiet disposition seem less aligned with the typical characteristics of someone pursuing a business administration degree, which often attracts more extroverted and business-oriented individuals. The key traits mentioned, like empathy and a love for animals, don't directly correlate with a business-focused curriculum.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles, is of high intelligence, and understands abstract concepts well. These traits are often associated with success in computer science, which requires problem-solving skills and abstract thinking. Additionally, while his curiosity about nature and empathy might not directly link to computer science, they also don't detract from it being a plausible field of study for him.

So, based on this analysis, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for each field as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "computer science": 0.30
}
```

These probabilities reflect a higher likelihood that Adam was enrolled in computer science over business administration, but they allow for the possibility of other, perhaps more fitting fields given his interests in nature and animals.
