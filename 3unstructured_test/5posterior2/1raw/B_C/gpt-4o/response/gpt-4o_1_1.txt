Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some estimates regarding the likelihood of him being enrolled in either computer science or business administration. Given Adam's deep curiosity about nature, quiet demeanor, love for animals, intelligence, and empathy, he seems more inclined toward fields that involve analytical thinking, understanding complex systems, and possibly aligning with nature or social values. 

Here is the probability estimate for each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

- **Computer science**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the field of computer science, which often requires such skills. While his deep love for nature might not be directly related, his analytical skills make this field a plausible option.

- **Business administration**: This field typically demands a different type of skill set, focused more on management, leadership, and business strategies. Adam's profile does not emphasize these traits as strongly, and hence it seems less likely for him to be enrolled in business administration.

The rest of the probability could be distributed among other fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology, which may align more closely with his love for nature, animals, and empathy.
