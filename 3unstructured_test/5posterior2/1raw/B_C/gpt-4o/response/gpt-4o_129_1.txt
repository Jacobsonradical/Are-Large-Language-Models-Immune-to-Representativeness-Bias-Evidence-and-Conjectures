Given Adam's personality sketch and the fields of computer science and business administration, we can make some educated estimates about his likelihood of being enrolled in either field. 

1. **Computer Science**: Adam shows a curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits align well with a field like computer science, which often involves abstract thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills.

2. **Business Administration**: Adam's empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work could make him suitable for many fields, including business administration. However, these traits don't align as strongly with the typical characteristics associated with a business-focused graduate student in the same way they do with a more analytical and abstract field like computer science.

Given this information:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These probabilities are subjective estimates based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the demands and typical characteristics of each field.
