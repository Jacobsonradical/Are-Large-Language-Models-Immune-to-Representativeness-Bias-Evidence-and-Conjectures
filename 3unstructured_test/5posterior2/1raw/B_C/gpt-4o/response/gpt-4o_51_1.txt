These are rough estimates based on Adam's personality sketch. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and abstract concepts aligns more closely with fields in the sciences and engineering than with business administration. His quiet nature, enjoyment of puzzles, and high intelligence suggest a strong fit for computer science, which often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking. While business administration can involve strategic thinking and problem-solving, it typically attracts individuals with a more extroverted nature and an interest in organizational dynamics and people management. Therefore, the probability for business administration is lower.
