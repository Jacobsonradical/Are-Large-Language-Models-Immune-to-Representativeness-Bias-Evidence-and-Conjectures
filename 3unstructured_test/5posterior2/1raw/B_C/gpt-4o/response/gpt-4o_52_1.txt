Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for his enrollment in the given graduate fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1, 
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Here's the rationale for these estimates:

1. **Business Administration (0.1)**: While business administration often calls for strong organizational skills and an understanding of market dynamics, Adam's empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature seem less aligned with the typical characteristics often associated with this field. Additionally, his interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests a more analytically oriented discipline.

2. **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills required in computer science. Additionally, computer science often involves logical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and a deep appreciation for hard work and dedication, all traits that match Adam's profile.

Given his specific interests and personality traits, he is more likely to be in a field that leverages his analytical and empathetic nature. Other fields like environmental science or biology might also be strong contenders, but these were not among the provided options.
