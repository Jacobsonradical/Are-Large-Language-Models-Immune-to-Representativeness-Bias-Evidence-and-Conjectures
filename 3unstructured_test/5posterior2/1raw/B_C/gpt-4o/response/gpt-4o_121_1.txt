Given Adam's traits of curiosity about nature, enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, computer science seems like it could be a possible field for him given its alignment with problem-solving and abstract thinking. However, while the traits don't strongly point towards business administration, it is possible though less likely given his stronger inclination towards empathy, animals, and nature which don't directly align with typical business administration interests.
