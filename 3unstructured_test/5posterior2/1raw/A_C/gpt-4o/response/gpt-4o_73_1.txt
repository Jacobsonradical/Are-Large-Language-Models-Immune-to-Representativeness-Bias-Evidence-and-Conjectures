Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can form a rough estimate of the probabilities that he was enrolled in the specified fields. 

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy, and a deep love for animals. These qualities are highly congruent with a field focused on agriculture and veterinary science, where understanding nature and animals is essential.

- **Computer Science**: Adam has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These qualities fit well with computer science, which often involves solving complex problems and dealing with abstract theories and algorithms. However, computer science might not immediately align with his strong empathy and love for animals unless he is working on something interdisciplinary like bioinformatics.

Given these considerations, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the alignment of his personality with the core activities and focuses of each field, though keep in mind these estimates are indicative and not definitive.
