Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer certain probabilities for his enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science versus computer science. 

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits are highly aligned with this field.
2. **Computer Science**: While Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence indicate that he could excel in computer science, the other traits mentioned (empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature) are less directly related to this field.

Given this information, the estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities could be as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
