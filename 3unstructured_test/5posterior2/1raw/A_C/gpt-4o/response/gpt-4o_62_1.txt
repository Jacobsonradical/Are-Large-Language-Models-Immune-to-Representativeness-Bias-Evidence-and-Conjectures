These estimates are based on the alignment between Adam's personality traits and typical characteristics or required skills in each field.

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, love for animals, and strong empathy, there's a significant likelihood that he would be drawn to a field that closely involves these interests. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with the demanding and practical nature of this field.

- **Computer science**: While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are well-suited for computer science, his main interests in nature, animals, and solving puzzles suggest a stronger alignment with agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, although he could excel in computer science, it's less likely to be his primary field of study.
