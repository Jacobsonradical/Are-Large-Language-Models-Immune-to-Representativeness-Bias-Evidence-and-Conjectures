Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can attempt to estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for the given fields of specialization. While it is important to acknowledge that these estimates are subjective and based solely on the provided information, we can make informed guesses.

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy seem to align well with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also be applicable to computer science. However, the specific details about his love for the natural world and animals may make the former field slightly more likely.

Here are the estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
