Based on Adam's personality sketch and given his traits and interests, we can make informed estimates about his likelihood of being enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science in 2021.

Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals. He also has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts and appreciates hard work and dedication. These traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary sciences due to his love for nature and animals, as well as his appreciation for dedication and hard work which are crucial in this field. 

While his interest in solving puzzles and his high intelligence may also suggest potential effectiveness in computer science, his other interests in nature and animals seem more dominant.

Thus, our estimates are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.35
}

These estimates reflect a higher likelihood that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, although there remains a reasonable possibility that he may have been studying computer science due to his problem-solving abilities and intelligence.
