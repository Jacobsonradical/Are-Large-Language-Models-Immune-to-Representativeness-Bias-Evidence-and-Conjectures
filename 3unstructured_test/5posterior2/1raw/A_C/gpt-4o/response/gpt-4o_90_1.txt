Given Adam's personality sketch, here are the best estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities for the fields in question:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These estimates are based on the fact that Adam's interests and personality traits align more closely with the field of agricultural and veterinary science due to his curiosity about nature, appreciation of hard work, empathy, and love for animals. While his high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles could be applicable to computer science, his specific interests suggest a stronger fit with agricultural and veterinary science.
