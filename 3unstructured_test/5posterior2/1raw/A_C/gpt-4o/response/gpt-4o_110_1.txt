Based on Adam's personality sketch, he has a deep love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as a strong curiosity and empathy. These traits strongly align with a person who might be interested in fields related to agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, his high intelligence and skill in understanding abstract concepts could also be relevant for computer science, especially if he enjoys solving puzzles. However, his personality seems to weigh more towards the natural sciences.

Given this information, the estimates of the posterior conditional probability might be:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "computer science": 0.30
}
