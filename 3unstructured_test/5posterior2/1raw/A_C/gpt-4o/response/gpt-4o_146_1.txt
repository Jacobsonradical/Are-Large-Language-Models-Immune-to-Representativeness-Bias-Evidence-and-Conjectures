Based on Adam's personality traits and interests, let's analyze the posterior conditional probabilities for each field:

- **Computer Science**: While Adam is described as having high intelligence and being good at understanding abstract concepts, which are traits beneficial for a computer science graduate student, his strong curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy align less directly with typical characteristics of a computer science student.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's strong curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, empathy, and warm heart align very well with the typical interests and personality traits of someone in agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication would also be relevant in these fields.

Given these considerations, my best estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```
