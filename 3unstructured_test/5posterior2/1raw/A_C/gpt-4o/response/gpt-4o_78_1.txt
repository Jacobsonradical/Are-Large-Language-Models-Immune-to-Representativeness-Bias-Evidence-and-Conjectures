Given Adam's personality sketch and background, we can make educated estimates about the likelihood of him being enrolled in each of the given fields. 

Given his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy, it is more likely that Adam would be interested in a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Additionally, his high intelligence and appreciation for hard work could attract him to scientific research and practical applications in this field.

On the other hand, computer science also requires high intelligence and problem-solving skills, which aligns with Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. However, his specific mentioned interests in nature, plants, and animals make it a bit less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on these considerations, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

These figures suggest a stronger likelihood of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, though not completely ruling out the possibility of him being in computer science.
