Based on Adam's personality sketch, I would estimate the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation:

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, along with his love for animals and warm-hearted, empathetic nature, strongly align with interests and traits typically seen in individuals pursuing fields like agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, it is highly likely that he could be enrolled in this field.

While Adam's high intelligence and penchant for solving puzzles fit the profile for a computer science student, his deep appreciation for nature and animals seems to place a higher likelihood on his being in a field directly related to those interests. Hence, the posterior conditional probability for computer science is also notable but lower.
