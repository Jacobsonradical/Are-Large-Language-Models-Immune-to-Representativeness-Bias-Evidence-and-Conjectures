Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can provide posterior conditional probabilities for his likely enrollment in the specified fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it seems more likely that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do not rule out computer science entirely. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a stronger inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science but still consider his potential interest in computer science.
