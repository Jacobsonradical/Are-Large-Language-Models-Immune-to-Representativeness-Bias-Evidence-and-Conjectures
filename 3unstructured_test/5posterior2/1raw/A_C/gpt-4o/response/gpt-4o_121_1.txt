Based on Adam's personality sketch, we note his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which align well with the agricultural and veterinary science field. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might give some indication for computer science, but the specific traits described (love for animals, nature, etc.) point more towards the former.

Here's my estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
