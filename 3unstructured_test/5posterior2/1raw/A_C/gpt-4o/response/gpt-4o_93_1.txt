Sure, based on Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind these estimates:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals strongly align with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well in this field.

- **Computer Science (0.2)**: Although Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, the other aspects of his personality (e.g., affinity towards nature, plants, and animals) don't align as closely with this field.

These values reflect the strongest and weakest alignments based on the provided personality sketch, keeping in mind that they need not add up to 1 as there could be other potential fields not listed here.
