Given Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, it is more likely that he would be drawn to agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are valuable in any field, but they do not strongly point towards computer science over other fields. Thus, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of him being in agricultural and veterinary science.
