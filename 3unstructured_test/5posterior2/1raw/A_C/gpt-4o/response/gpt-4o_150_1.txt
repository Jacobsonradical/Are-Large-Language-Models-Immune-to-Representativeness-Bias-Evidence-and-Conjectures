Based on Adam's personality sketch and the fields provided, I would estimate the following posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Explanation:

- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy aligns strongly with fields related to agricultural and veterinary science. His deep love for animals also supports this field.
- His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit computer science, but there are fewer direct personality traits pointing in that direction compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
