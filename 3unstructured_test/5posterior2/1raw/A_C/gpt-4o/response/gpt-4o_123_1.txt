Given Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, appreciation for nature and plants, and warm-heartedness, he seems more aligned with a field that involves living organisms and their care, making agricultural and veterinary science a higher probability. His intelligence and abstract thinking could apply to computer science as well, but the personality traits described are more suggestive of a natural sciences orientation.
