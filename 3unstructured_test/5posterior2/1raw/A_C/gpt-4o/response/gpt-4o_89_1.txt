Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, the probabilities for each field can be estimated as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values reflect his love for nature, plants, and animals, which align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts also make computer science a plausible field of study.
