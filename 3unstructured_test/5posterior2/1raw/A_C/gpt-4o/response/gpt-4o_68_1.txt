Given Adam's personality sketch, here's my best estimate of the posterior conditional probability for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Reasoning:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with this field. These characteristics suggest he would likely be drawn to studies that involve understanding and interacting with plants, animals, and the environment.
- **Computer science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which are key traits for success in computer science, his more pronounced interest in nature and animals suggests a slightly lower probability for this field.
