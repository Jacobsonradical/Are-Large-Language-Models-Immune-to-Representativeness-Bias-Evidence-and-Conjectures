Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, it's more likely that he would be enrolled in a field related to nature and animals. Therefore, the probability that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is higher than the probability for computer science. However, since he is also described as someone with high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, there is still some probability that he could be in a field like computer science, though it is lower.

Here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
