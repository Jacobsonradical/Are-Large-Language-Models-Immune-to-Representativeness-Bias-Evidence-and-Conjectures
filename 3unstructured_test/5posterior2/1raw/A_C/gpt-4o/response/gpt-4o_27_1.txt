**Explanation:**

Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science due to his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm empathy. These characteristics align well with agricultural and veterinary science, which often involves direct interaction with nature and animals.

While his high intelligence and abstract thinking could make computer science a possible field, his empathic nature, love for animals, and curiosity about plants tilt the probability more towards agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, I assigned a higher probability to agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
