To provide estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities, I'll consider Adam's interests, personality traits, and the fields mentioned.

Given Adam's:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Love for animals
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Additionally, he is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which aligns with fields requiring analytical and problem-solving skills.

Here are my estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

### Rationale:
1. **Computer Science (0.2)**:
   - Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts make it possible for him to be in computer science.
   - However, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, combined with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, does not strongly align with the typical personality of someone primarily focused on computer science.
   - Therefore, though possible, it is less likely.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**:
   - His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science fields.
   - These fields also require intelligence and problem-solving skills, fitting well with Adam's personality sketch.
   - Therefore, it is much more likely that Adam is enrolled in this field compared to computer science.
