These probabilities reflect the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the typical characteristics and interests associated with each field. His love for nature, plants, animals, and strong empathy suggests a stronger fit with agricultural and veterinary science.

These are rough estimates and actual probabilities would depend on additional contextual data.
