Based on the personality sketch provided, let's assess the probabilities:

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. He enjoys solving puzzles.
3. He has a strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
4. He possesses high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. He has an appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given this information, Adam's interests and personality traits align more closely with fields that involve nature, plants, animals, and potentially empathy-driven work. This makes agricultural and veterinary science a strong candidate. However, his high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles also lean towards computer science, which often benefits from such traits.

Still, considering his love for nature and animals, agricultural and veterinary science should have a higher probability.
