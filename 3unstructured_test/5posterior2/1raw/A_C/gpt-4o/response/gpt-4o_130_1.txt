Explanation:

Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet personality and interest in solving puzzles, as well as his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, suggest he could also have an interest in computer science, but to a lesser extent. Thus, these estimates reflect a stronger likelihood towards agricultural and veterinary science while acknowledging some probability of enrollment in computer science.
