Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants make it highly plausible that he would be drawn to a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with the demanding nature of this field.

On the other hand, his high intelligence and capability to understand abstract concepts, along with enjoying solving puzzles, do align with qualities beneficial in computer science. However, the more pronounced traits related to nature and animals suggest a stronger likelihood for the agricultural and veterinary science field.
