Based on the personality sketch of Adam, let's analyze the probabilities for each of the provided fields of study.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
Considering Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, deep love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and dedication, it seems quite plausible that he could be inclined towards a field directly related to nature and animals. These personality traits align well with someone who might thrive and find fulfillment in agricultural and veterinary science.

**Computer Science:**
While Adam has high intelligence and is good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are qualities beneficial in computer science, the rest of his personality sketch doesn't strongly indicate a passion for this field. His interests seem more naturally aligned with the organic world rather than technological constructs.

Taking these points into consideration, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These estimates are based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the typical skill sets and interests associated with each field of study.
