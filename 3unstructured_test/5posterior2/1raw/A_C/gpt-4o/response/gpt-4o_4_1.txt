Here is an estimate of the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the given fields based on his personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Computer Science (0.3)**: While Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which are traits often associated with computer science students, his deep love for animals and strong empathy might make fields like computer science less likely for him. Therefore, there is some possibility but not a dominant one.
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and strong empathy, this field aligns very closely with his interests and personality traits, making it a more likely choice.
