To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities of Adam being enrolled in either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "computer science" based on the given personality sketch, we should consider how well his interests and skills align with each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - He appreciates hard work and dedication.
   These traits are strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science, which often involves working with plants and animals and requires dedication and an understanding of natural processes.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles.
   - He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
   These characteristics could align with computer science, which often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking. However, the information provided does not strongly indicate a specific interest in computers or programming.

Based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the probable demands and nature of each field, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect a stronger fit for agricultural and veterinary science given Adam's love for nature and animals, while still acknowledging that his problem-solving skills and intelligence could make computer science a possible field of study.
