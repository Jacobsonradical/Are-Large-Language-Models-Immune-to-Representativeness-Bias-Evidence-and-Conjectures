To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits align with typical attributes associated with each field.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems these traits are more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. Meanwhile, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could resonate with both fields, but his specific interests in nature and animals push the likelihood more significantly towards agricultural and veterinary science. 

**Computer Science**:
- Traits like high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well.
- However, less emphasis in his sketch on problem-solving in the context of technology.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- Traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align very strongly.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with this field, which often involves physically and emotionally demanding work with animals and nature.

Thus, my estimates are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
