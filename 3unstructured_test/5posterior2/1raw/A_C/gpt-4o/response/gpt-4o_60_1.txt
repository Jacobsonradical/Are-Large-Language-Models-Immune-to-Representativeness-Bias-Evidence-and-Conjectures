Given Adam's personality sketch, let's evaluate the likelihood that he was enrolled in each of the listed fields of study. 

1. Computer science: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence make computer science a plausible field. However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication do not align as strongly with typical characteristics commonly attributed to this field. Thus, while there is some alignment, it is not as strong.

2. Agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align closely with characteristics desirable in agricultural and veterinary science. This field seems to be a natural fit given his personality traits.

Based on this analysis, here's the estimated posterior conditional probability:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
