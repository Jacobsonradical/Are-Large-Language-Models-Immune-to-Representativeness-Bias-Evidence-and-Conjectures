{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.35
}

Here's a brief explanation of the estimates:

- **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.65)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, it seems highly plausible that he might pursue a field where these interests align closely, such as agricultural or veterinary science. His empathy and warm heart are also strong indicators that he may be drawn to a field where he can work directly with living beings and contribute to their well-being.

- **Computer science (0.35)**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, particularly in understanding abstract concepts, suggests he might be interested in a field like computer science. However, the personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature and animals more prominently, which slightly lowers the probability for this field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
