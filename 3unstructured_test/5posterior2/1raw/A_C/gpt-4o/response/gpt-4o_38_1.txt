Based on the information provided about Adam, we can infer certain likelihoods for each field of study. Hereâ€™s my best estimation of the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals align very well with agricultural and veterinary science. These qualities are highly relevant to a field involving the study of plants, animals, and the environment.
- While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him suitable for computer science, the specifics of his personality sketch lean more towards a preference for biological and environmental sciences. However, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence still suggest a non-negligible probability for computer science.
