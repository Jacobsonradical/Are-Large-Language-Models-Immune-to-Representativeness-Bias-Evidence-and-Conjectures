Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer a few things that might help us estimate the probabilities:

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. He has a deep love for animals.
3. He enjoys solving puzzles.
4. He is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. He has strong empathy and a warm heart.
6. He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these factors, Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals strongly aligns with fields such as agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence, ability to solve puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts also make him a good candidate for computer science. However, his strong empathy and appreciation for hard work could suggest a preference for a field where he can work closely with living beings, possibly tilting the balance slightly towards agricultural and veterinary science.

With those considerations in mind, we can estimate as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These estimates reflect the balance between his interest in nature and animals (which leans towards agricultural and veterinary science) and his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills (which leans towards computer science).
