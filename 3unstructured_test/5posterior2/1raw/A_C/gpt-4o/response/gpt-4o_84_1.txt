1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with this field. People who pursue agricultural and veterinary sciences often have a deep interest in plants, animals, and the environment.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts indicates a potential fit for computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for nature and animals might make this field less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Given this analysis, here's the best estimation for the conditional probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
