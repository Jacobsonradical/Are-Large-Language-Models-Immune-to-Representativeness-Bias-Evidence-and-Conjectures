Based on Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for the given fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for nature and hard work align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do suggest that he could also be interested in a field like computer science, hence the non-zero probability for that field.
