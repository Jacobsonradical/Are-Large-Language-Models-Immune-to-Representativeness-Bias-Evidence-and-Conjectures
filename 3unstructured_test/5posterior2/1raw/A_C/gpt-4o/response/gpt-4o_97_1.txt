Based on Adam's personality sketch, I will provide my best estimates for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, this field seems to align well with his interests and personality traits.
- **Computer science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, his strong empathy and deep love for animals suggest that agricultural and veterinary science might be a slightly better fit.
