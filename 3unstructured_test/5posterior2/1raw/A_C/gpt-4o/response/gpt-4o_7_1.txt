Explanation:

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and strong empathy, it seems highly probable that he would be drawn to a field closely related to those interests, such as agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with the demands of this field, which often requires a deep commitment to caring for animals and understanding ecological systems.

On the other hand, while Adam is described as having high intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts, which are suitable for computer science, there is less in his personality sketch to suggest a direct link to this field. His quiet nature and love for puzzles could correlate with interests in computer science, but the overall probability seems lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
