Given Adam's personality sketch, I can provide estimates based on the alignment of his interests and traits with each field. Note that these are subjective probabilities and should be treated as rough estimates.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science. His empathy and appreciation for hard work further support this probability.
- While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts (traits that are beneficial in computer science), these traits are less specifically aligned with computer science than they are with agricultural and veterinary science, leading to a lower probability for this field.
