The reasoning behind these estimates is as follows:

- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his empathy, and love for animals strongly align with fields related to agricultural and veterinary science, making it more likely that he would be enrolled in that field.
- While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts, which could suit a field like computer science, his personality traits and passions seem more fitting for agricultural and veterinary science.
