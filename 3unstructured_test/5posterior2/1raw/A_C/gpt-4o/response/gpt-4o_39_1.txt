Given Adam's personality sketch, his strong empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and an appreciation for hard work, he seems more aligned with fields that involve direct interaction with nature and animals. However, he also has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which could indicate potential in an analytical or problem-solving field like computer science.

Based on these observations, here are my best estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These estimates suggest that while Adam's personality traits and interests make him more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, there is still a non-negligible probability that he could be in computer science given his intelligence and problem-solving skills.
