Given Adam's personality traits and interests, it seems likely that he would be enrolled in a field that aligns with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for the hard work and dedication. While computer science could also appeal to his intelligence and problem-solving abilities, it does not as strongly align with his empathy, love for animals, and nature as agricultural and veterinary science does.

With that in mind, here's an estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

These values reflect the stronger alignment of agricultural and veterinary science with Adam's interests and personality traits, while still recognizing that his intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles could make computer science a plausible, though less likely, field of study for him.
