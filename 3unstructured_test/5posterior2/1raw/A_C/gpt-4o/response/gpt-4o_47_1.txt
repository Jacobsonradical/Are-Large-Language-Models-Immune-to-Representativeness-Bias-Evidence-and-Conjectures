Based on Adam's personality sketch, which highlights his genuine curiosity about nature, understanding of plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems more likely that his field of study aligns with something related to nature and animals. This would point more towards agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and interest in abstract concepts could also align with computer science, but it does not seem as strong a match given the absence of specific indicators related to technology or computer-related interests. Hence, the probabilities are estimated as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
