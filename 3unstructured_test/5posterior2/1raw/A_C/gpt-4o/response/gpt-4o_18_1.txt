Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood of his field of study given his characteristics:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy. These traits align well with interests typically seen in students of agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication would also be advantageous in this field.
   - Given these considerations, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science seems relatively high.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are traits common in computer science students who often need to solve complex problems and understand abstract concepts. However, there are no specific indications of an interest in technology or computing from the personality sketch.
   - Considering the lack of direct evidence pointing towards an interest in computing and technology, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science seems lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Therefore, we might estimate the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Please note that these values are estimates based on the given personality sketch and may vary with additional context or information.
