Based on the personality sketch of Adam, we will evaluate the posterior conditional probabilities for the two specified fields, "agricultural and veterinary science" and "computer science."

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his strong empathy, and warm heart, it is highly likely that he might be involved in fields that are closely related to these traits, such as agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, his high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could be seen as traits suitable for computer science.

However, the detailed sketch specifies a deeper connection to nature and animals, which aligns more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science.

Here are the posterior conditional probability estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

These estimations are based on the personality traits that align more closely with the mentioned fields of study.
