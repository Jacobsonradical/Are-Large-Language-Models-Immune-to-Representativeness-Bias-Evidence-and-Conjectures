Based on Adam's personality sketch, here is an estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities for the two given fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Given Adam's strong empathy, warm heart, deep love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants, it seems more likely that he would pursue a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also make it possible for him to be in computer science, though this seems less aligned with his interests.
