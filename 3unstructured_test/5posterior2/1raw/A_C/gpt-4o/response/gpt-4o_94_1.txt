Based on Adam's personality sketch, it is possible to make some educated guesses about his likely field of study in 2021. 

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, strong empathy, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all suggest certain affiliations with specific academic fields.

Taking these factors into account:

- "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants," "deep love for animals," and "strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication" imply a strong fit with agricultural and veterinary science.
- "Enjoys solving puzzles" and "high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts" could also suggest a fit with computer science, but this is less directly indicated by his other traits.

Here is the estimated posterior conditional probability:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These probabilities reflect that while Adam has attributes that could fit both fields, his traits more strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science based on the information provided.
