Given Adam's personality traits and interests, we can form reasonable estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities for him being enrolled in different fields of graduate study in 2021. 

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and empathy suggest he might be well suited for a program like agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might also fit well with computer science, especially since these fields often require strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

Considering these observations, the estimated probabilities might look something like this:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These probabilities indicate that based on Adam's personality sketch, he is somewhat more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science, but both fields are plausible given his attributes.
