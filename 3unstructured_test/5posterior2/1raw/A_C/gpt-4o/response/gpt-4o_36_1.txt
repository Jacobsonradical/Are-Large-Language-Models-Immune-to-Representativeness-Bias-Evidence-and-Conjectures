Based on Adam's personality sketch and characteristics:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He has a strong empathy and deep love for animals.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.
- He is quiet and enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.

Given these attributes, here are the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals aligns well with this field. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits the demands of this discipline. Therefore, the probability is relatively high.
- **Computer Science**: While Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts suggest he could excel in computer science, his deep love for animals and nature lowers the probability compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

It's important to note that these values are estimates based on the information provided and are inherently subjective.
