Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can form some estimates about his likelihood of being enrolled in different fields of study.

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals suggest a strong alignment with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and interest in solving puzzles could fit well with computer science, but his appreciation for nature and animals makes agricultural and veterinary science seem like a more direct match.

Here's a rough estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

These estimates reflect the relative strengths of Adam's personality traits and interests as described.
