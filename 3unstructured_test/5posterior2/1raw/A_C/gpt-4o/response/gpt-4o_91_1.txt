Given Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the probabilities that he was enrolled in each field based on how well his interests and characteristics align with the typical traits and passions associated with those fields.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - He has a strong love for animals.
   - He has an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which is common in agricultural and veterinary sciences.

These traits strongly align with the characteristics typically needed and valued in agricultural and veterinary sciences. As such, the posterior conditional probability for this field would be relatively high.

2. **Computer Science**: 
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts well.
   - He is highly intelligent.

While these characteristics are relevant to computer science, the personality sketch emphasizes his affinity towards nature, animals, and empathy more strongly, which are less commonly associated with computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Given these points, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the stronger alignment of Adam's interests and personality with agricultural and veterinary science while acknowledging that some of his traits do fit well with computer science.
