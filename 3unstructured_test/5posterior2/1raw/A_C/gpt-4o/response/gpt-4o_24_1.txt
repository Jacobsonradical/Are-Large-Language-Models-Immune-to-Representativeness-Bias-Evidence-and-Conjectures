Based on Adam's personality sketch which highlights his curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, we can make some estimates regarding the probability of his graduate field of study. The information suggests that he is more likely to be involved in a field that directly relates to these interests.

Given that, here's the estimation:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,  // While he is high in intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, the personality sketch doesn't suggest a direct link to computer science.
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7  // His deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and empathy make this field a more likely choice.
