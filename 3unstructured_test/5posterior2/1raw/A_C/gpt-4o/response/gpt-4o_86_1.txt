Based on Adam's personality sketch and educational status as a graduate student in 2021, I can provide the following estimates for the posterior conditional probability that he was enrolled in each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, along with a deep love for animals. This aligns strongly with agricultural and veterinary science.
- His high intelligence and ability to solve puzzles, as well as understanding abstract concepts, also fit well with computer science. However, his warm heart, strong empathy, and nature-related interests suggest a stronger inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science.

These are estimates and should be taken as such, based on the information provided and typical characteristics of these fields.
