Based on Adam's personality sketch and background information, we can make informed estimates of the likelihood that he was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.35
}

### Rationale:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given his deep love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy and appreciation for hard work, Adam's personality aligns significantly with this field. Individuals in agricultural and veterinary sciences often have a deep connection with nature and a dedication to the care and understanding of plants and animals. Thus, this field seems highly probable for Adam.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills needed in computer science. However, the personality sketch emphasizes his connection to nature and animals more strongly, making this field somewhat plausible but less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.

These estimates represent a subjective judgment based on the provided personality traits and background information.
