Sure, I can provide an estimated posterior conditional probability based on Adam's personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.35
}

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems quite plausible that he could be studying agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts also align well with a field requiring rigorous study and a deep understanding of biological and environmental systems.

On the other hand, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence align well with the skills needed in computer science. However, his other traits (such as his love for nature and animals) seem to more strongly point towards agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the probabilities have been weighted accordingly.
