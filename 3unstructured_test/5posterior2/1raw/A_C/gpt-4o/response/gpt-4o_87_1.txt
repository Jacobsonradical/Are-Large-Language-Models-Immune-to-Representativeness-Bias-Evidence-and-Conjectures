Given Adam's strong empathy, curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it seems more likely that he would be drawn towards a field such as agricultural and veterinary science. His interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence suggest he could also be involved in computer science, but his inclination towards nature and animals makes agricultural and veterinary science the stronger candidate.
