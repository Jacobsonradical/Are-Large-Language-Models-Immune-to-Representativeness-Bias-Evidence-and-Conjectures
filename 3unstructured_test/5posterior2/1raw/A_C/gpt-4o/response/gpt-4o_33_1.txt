Explanation:

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, along with his strong empathy and deep love for animals, makes it quite likely that he was enrolled in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns well with the hands-on nature and commitment required in these fields.

On the other hand, while Adam is described as having high intelligence and good abstract thinking skills, which are relevant to computer science, the other attributes mentioned in his personality sketch don't align as closely with this field. His empathy and love for animals, for instance, suggest a stronger likelihood towards agricultural and veterinary science rather than computer science.
