Explanation: Based on Adam's personality sketch, he has a strong appreciation for nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His qualities of empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature strongly suggest he might be more inclined towards this field. However, his high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts might also make him suitable for computer science, hence a non-negligible probability is assigned to it as well.
