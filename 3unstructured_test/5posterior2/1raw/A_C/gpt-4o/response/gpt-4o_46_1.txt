Given Adam's personality sketch, his deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and strong empathy suggest a natural alignment with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do provide some basis for computer science, but it seems less consistent with the other facets of his personality. Therefore, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
