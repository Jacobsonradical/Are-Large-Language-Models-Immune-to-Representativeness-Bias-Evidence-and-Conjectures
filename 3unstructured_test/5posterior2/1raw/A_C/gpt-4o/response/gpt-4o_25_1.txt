To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, let's consider the key personality traits and interests that align with each field.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
- Deep love for animals
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication
These traits strongly align with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, it's reasonable to infer that the likelihood of him being in this field is relatively high.

**Computer Science:**
- Enjoys solving puzzles (a relevant trait for computer science)
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts (relevant but not conclusive)
The traits of enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could align with Computer Science. However, the other mentioned characteristics do not strongly suggest a focus on computer science; therefore, while it's possible, it seems less likely than the Agricultural and Veterinary Science field.

Given this analysis, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values are indicative and reflect the degree to which Adam's personality traits align with each field, with a higher probability assigned to Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to the stronger alignment of his key traits with that domain.
