Given Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

1. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals strongly aligns with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
2. Despite being good at understanding abstract concepts, which is relevant to computer science, his interests and empathy seem more closely tied to the natural world and animal care.

Therefore, we can estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, given his interests and personality traits.
