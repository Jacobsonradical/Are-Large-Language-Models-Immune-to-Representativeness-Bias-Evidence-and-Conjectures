Based on Adam's personality sketch, it seems more likely he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science due to his genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, empathy, and deep love for animals. These traits strongly align with interests and values often seen in this field. 

Although he is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, which are valuable in computer science, his interest in nature and animals suggests a stronger alignment with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, while it's possible he could be in computer science due to his intellectual skills, it seems less likely based on his described interests.
