Based on Adam's personality sketch and his characteristics, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for each field given the information provided:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** 
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - These traits align well with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
   - While these traits could fit someone in Computer Science, they are not as closely aligned with the specific interests in nature and animals described.

Given these considerations, the estimated probabilities might look something like this:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the alignment between Adam's interests and personality traits with the respective fields.
