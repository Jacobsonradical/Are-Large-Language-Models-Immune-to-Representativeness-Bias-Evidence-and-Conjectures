Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature, including plants, suggest a higher likelihood that he would be interested in a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could apply to both fields, but the specific interest in nature and animals pushes the estimation higher for agricultural and veterinary science. Conversely, while his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are relevant to computer science, his other traits do not strongly indicate a predisposition for that field.
