Based on Adam's personality sketch, he has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals. These traits align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, while he is intelligent and enjoys solving puzzles, which are attributes that could align with computer science, there is no specific mention of a direct interest in technology or computers.

Given these considerations, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
