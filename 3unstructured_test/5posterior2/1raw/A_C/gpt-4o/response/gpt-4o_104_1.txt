Given the personality sketch of Adam, the characteristics such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work are more aligned with fields connected to agriculture and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do leave room for fields like computer science, but his empathy and passion for animals tilt the probabilities more towards the former.

Here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.20
}
```

These estimates suggest that based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science. However, his intelligence and aptitude for abstract thinking do keep computer science within the realm of possibility.
