Explanation:
Given Adam's personality sketch, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants make agricultural and veterinary science a highly likely field for him. His high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts would allow for success in any field, including computer science, but these traits alone do not outweigh the stronger indications provided by his interest in nature and animals. As such, the probability for agricultural and veterinary science is higher at 0.70, while computer science has a lower, but non-negligible, probability of 0.25.
