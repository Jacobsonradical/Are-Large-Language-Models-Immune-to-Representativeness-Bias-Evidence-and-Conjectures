Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make educated guesses about the likelihood that he was enrolled in specific graduate fields. Adam's interests and traits include a love for nature, animals, solving puzzles, empathy, and high intelligence. These characteristics might make certain fields more likely than others. 

Here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for the given fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

### Explanation:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, along with his deep love for animals, strongly aligns with this field.
- His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well within the agricultural and veterinary sciences, where hands-on effort and persistence are crucial.

**Computer Science (0.2):**
- Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence would naturally lend themselves to computer science, as the field often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking.
- However, the characteristics more heavily emphasizing nature and empathy make agricultural and veterinary science a better fit.

While it's possible for Adam to be in other fields that weren't listed, these estimates are based on the information provided about his personality.
