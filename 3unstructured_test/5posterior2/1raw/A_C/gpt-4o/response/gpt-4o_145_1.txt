Given Adam's personality sketch, including his love for nature, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it seems more aligned with fields that involve working with living organisms and the environment. Let's estimate the posterior probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These estimates reflect that Adam's interests and qualities are more closely related to agricultural and veterinary science than to computer science. However, given his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, there is still a reasonable probability that he could be in computer science.
