{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

The reason for these estimates is as follows:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his deep love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with fields involving agriculture and veterinary science. These fields directly relate to his interests in plants and animals.

- Computer Science: While Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit well with computer science, this field appears less directly aligned with his expressed interests in nature, plants, and animals compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the probability for computer science is lower but still notable given his analytical skills.
