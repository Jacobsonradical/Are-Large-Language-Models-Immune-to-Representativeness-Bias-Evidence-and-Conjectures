Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, we'll consider how well each field matches the described traits. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a significant inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. In contrast, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence might point towards computer science. However, we must weigh these against the overall relevance of his personality traits to each field.

Given this analysis, here are the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood that Adam's interests and personality align more with agricultural and veterinary science, while still acknowledging a reasonable possibility that he could be interested in computer science due to his problem-solving skills and intelligence.
