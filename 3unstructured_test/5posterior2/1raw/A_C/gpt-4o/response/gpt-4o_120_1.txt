Given Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for each field based on the information provided:

- His genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, and his deep love for animals, strongly suggest an inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science.
- His high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts could be beneficial for both computer science and agricultural/veterinary science, but his empathy, warm heart, and specific interests in animals and nature lean more heavily towards agricultural/veterinary sciences.

Therefore, the estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities are as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values indicate a higher likelihood that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality traits and interests.
