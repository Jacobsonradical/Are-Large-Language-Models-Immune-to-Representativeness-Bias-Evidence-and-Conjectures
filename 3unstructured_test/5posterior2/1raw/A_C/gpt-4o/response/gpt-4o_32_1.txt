Adamâ€™s interest in nature, plants, and animals, combined with his strong empathy and love for animals, makes it more probable that he is involved in agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do suggest a potential fit for computer science, especially since that field can involve complex puzzles and problem-solving, which he enjoys. However, the strong overlap between his personality traits and the attributes commonly associated with agricultural and veterinary science leads to a higher estimated probability in that field.
