Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make educated guesses about the likelihood of his enrollment in specific graduate fields. Here they are:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are traits often found in computer science students. His enjoyment of solving puzzles also aligns well with the problem-solving nature of the field. However, there isn't a strong indication that his curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals are particularly related to computer science.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals make agricultural and veterinary science a more fitting choice. His understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication also align well with the demanding nature of this field.

Based on these considerations, here are the estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values indicate that while it's possible for Adam to be in computer science due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills, his personality sketch makes it more likely for him to be in agricultural and veterinary science.
