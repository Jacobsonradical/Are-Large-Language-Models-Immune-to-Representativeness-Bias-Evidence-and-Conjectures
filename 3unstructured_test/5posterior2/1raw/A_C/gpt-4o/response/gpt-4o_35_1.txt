Given the personality sketch of Adam and the fields in question, we can infer some likelihoods based on his attributes and interests. 

- Adam demonstrates a genuine curiosity about nature, an interest in plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy. These traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science.
- He is intelligent, enjoys solving puzzles, and has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These are traits that can be valuable in computer science as well.

Given these considerations, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities, though they are subjective and based on limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the higher likelihood of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science due to his specific interests in nature and animals, although his intelligence and problem-solving skills still make computer science a plausible field.
