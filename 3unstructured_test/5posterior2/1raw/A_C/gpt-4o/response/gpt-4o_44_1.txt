Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the conditional probabilities for each field as follows:

1. Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.
2. His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with computer science.

Taking these factors into consideration, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

These estimates reflect the observed alignment between Adam's characteristics and each field's typical demands and nature.
