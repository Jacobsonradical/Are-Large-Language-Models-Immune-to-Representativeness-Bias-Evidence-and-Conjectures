Given Adam's personality sketch, the estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities for each field given his traits and interests can be reasoned as follows:

Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, which strongly align with the interests and attributes typically found in students of agricultural and veterinary science. His empathy and appreciation for hard work are also important qualities in this field.

On the other hand, while Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are qualities that could be beneficial in computer science, the sketch does not particularly emphasize interests typically associated with computer science such as programming, software development, or technology.

Based on these considerations, the estimates are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values reflect higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science due to the direct alignment with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, while still recognizing that his problem-solving skills and intelligence could reasonably fit in computer science.
