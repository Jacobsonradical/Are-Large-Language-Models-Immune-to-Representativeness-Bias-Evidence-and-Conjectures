Using the information provided in Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for each field. 

Given his strong empathy, love for animals, appreciation of hard work and nature, agricultural and veterinary science seems like a more plausible field for him. His high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts could also point towards computer science, but the affinity for nature and animals tilts the balance significantly towards agricultural and veterinary science.

Here are the estimates:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values do not sum to 1 because there is a possibility that Adam could be enrolled in another field of specialization. The higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science reflects the alignment of his personality traits with this field.
