Based on the given personality sketch, here are the estimates of the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Rationale:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, a higher probability is assigned here.
- While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are relevant to computer science, his interests and empathy-related characteristics lean more towards agricultural and veterinary science, making the probability for computer science slightly lower in this context.
