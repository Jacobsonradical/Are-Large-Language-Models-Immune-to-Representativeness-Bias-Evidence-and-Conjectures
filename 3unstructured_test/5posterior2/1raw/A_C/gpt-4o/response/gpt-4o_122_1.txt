Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science due to his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy, which suggests a care-oriented field. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts provide some basis for the possibility of studying computer science, although it seems a bit less aligned with his expressed interests compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
