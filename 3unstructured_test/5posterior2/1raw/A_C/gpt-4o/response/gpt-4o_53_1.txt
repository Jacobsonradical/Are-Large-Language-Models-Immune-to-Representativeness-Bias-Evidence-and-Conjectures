Given Adam's personality sketch, here's an estimation of the posterior conditional probabilities that he was enrolled in each of the fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Rationale:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with agricultural and veterinary science, leading to a higher probability estimate for this field.
- His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are key traits for computer science, but the sketch places a stronger emphasis on his affinity for nature and animals, which makes this field slightly less likely.
