Based on Adam's personality sketch, here are the posterior conditional probabilities of him being enrolled in each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals aligns strongly with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, thus warranting a higher probability.
- Although Adam is described as intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts (qualities that are often beneficial in computer science), his interests and empathy towards nature and animals suggest a lower probability for enrollment in computer science.
