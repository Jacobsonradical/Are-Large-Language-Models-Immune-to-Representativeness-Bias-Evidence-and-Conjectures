Given Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: While Adam is described as quiet, intelligent, and enjoys solving puzzles—all characteristics that could align well with a graduate student in computer science—the strong emphasis on his love for nature, animals, and empathy does not strongly align with this field.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication are highly indicative of someone who might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His warm heart and empathy also strongly support this field, making it a more likely choice given his personality sketch.
