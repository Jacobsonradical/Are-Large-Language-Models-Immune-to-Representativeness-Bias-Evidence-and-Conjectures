Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer which field he might be more likely to be enrolled in as a graduate student. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align more closely with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, his high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles could also make him a good candidate for computer science.

Here's an estimation of the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are based on the available descriptive information, suggesting a stronger alignment with agricultural and veterinary science, but still acknowledging some potential fit for computer science due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills.
