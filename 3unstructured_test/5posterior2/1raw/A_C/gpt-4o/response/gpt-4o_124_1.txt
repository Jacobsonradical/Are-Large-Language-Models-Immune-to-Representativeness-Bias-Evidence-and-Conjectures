Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests:

- A genuine curiosity about nature and various plants
- A deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong empathy
- Enjoys solving puzzles

I would estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These estimates are based on the alignment between Adam's traits and the typical interests and skills required in these fields. His curiosity about nature and love for animals strongly suggest a fit for agricultural and veterinary science, whereas his intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles are also well-suited for computer science, but to a somewhat lesser extent given the other highlighted traits.
