Explanation: Given Adam's personality traits—genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work—there is a higher posterior conditional probability that he is enrolled in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. Although he is also intelligent and good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, these traits are somewhat overshadowed by his strong affinity for nature and animals. Therefore, while there is still a possibility that Adam could be in computer science, the likelihood is higher for agricultural and veterinary science based on the given personality sketch.
