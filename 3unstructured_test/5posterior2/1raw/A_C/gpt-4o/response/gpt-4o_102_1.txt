Sure, I'll provide my best estimates based on the given personality sketch.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3

Explanation:
Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals, it seems quite likely that he might be enrolled in a field closely related to these interests, such as agricultural and veterinary science. His strong empathy and appreciation for hard work may also align well with this field.

On the other hand, while Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which can be associated with success in fields like computer science, the details about his passion for nature, plants, and animals lean more heavily towards agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the probability for computer science is set lower but still significant.
