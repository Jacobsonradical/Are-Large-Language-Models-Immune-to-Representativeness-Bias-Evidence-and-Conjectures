Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer that he has a strong inclination toward nature, animals, and abstract thinking. The agricultural and veterinary science field aligns well with his interests in nature and love for animals. On the other hand, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also be relevant for computer science, though his specific curiosity about plants and animals may make that field less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
