Given Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for the two fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Explanation:
- Adam's strong empathy for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with agricultural and veterinary science.
- His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest there is some possibility he could be drawn to computer science, although the other traits point more strongly toward the first field.
