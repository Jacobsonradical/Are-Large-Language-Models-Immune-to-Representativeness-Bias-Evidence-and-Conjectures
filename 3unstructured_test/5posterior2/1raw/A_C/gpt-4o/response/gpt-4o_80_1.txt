Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have traits and interests that align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science rather than computer science. His genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work suggest a stronger connection to agricultural and veterinary science.

So, I would estimate the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Note that these are subjective estimates based on the personality information provided, and other fields or considerations could influence these probabilities.
