  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}

**Explanation:**

Given Adam's deep love for animals and strong empathy, alongside his curiosity about nature and plants, it is likely that he would be drawn to a field like agricultural and veterinary science. This field aligns well with his interests and traits, making a high probability reasonable. However, since there are other fields that may also suit his personality sketch (such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology due to his empathy), I have not given it a probability of 1.
