}

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work—as well as his highly intelligent and abstract thinking abilities—it seems reasonably likely that he was enrolled in a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

However, the probability is not 1 because these characteristics could also apply to other related fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps even psychology.
