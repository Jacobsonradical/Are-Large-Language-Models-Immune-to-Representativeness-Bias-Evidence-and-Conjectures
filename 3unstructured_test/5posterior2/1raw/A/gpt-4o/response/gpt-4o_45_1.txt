  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Given Adam's deep appreciation for nature, plants, animals, and his warm-hearted and empathetic nature, it is quite likely that he would be drawn to a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His strong intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would serve him well in this field. Therefore, I estimate a high posterior conditional probability that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
