}

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, and his empathy, it is highly plausible that his interests align with agricultural and veterinary science. Furthermore, his appreciation for hard work and dedication, alongside his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, provides a strong foundation for a field that demands both practical and theoretical knowledge. Thus, it seems fairly likely that Adam could have been enrolled in this field.
