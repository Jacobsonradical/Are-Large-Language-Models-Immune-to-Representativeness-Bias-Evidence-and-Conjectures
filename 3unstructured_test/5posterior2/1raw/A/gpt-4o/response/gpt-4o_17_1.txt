}

Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is quite plausible that he would be drawn to a field that aligns with these interests. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also be beneficial in agricultural and veterinary sciences, where both theoretical knowledge and practical applications are crucial. Therefore, a probability of 0.8 seems reasonable.
