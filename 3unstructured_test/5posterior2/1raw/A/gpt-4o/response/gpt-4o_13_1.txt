}

Given Adam's deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, and his warm heart and strong empathy, it is quite plausible that he would be enrolled in a field like agricultural and veterinary science where he could integrate his interests and capabilities. His intelligence and appreciation for hard work also align well with the demands of this field. Thus, the posterior conditional probability is reasonably high.
