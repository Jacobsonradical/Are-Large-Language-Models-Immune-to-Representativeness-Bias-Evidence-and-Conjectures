Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make an educated guess on the likelihood that he was enrolled in each of the specified fields. Although we lack specific quantitative data, the description of his interests and traits can guide our qualitative estimates. 

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.20,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
```

**Justifications:**

1. **Business Administration (0.05):** Adam's personality sketch suggests a strong interest in nature and animals, empathy, and solving puzzles. There is little in his sketch that directly aligns with typical characteristics or interests of someone in business administration.

2. **Computer Science (0.20):** Adam shows an enjoyment in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science. However, his strong focus on nature and animals makes this field somewhat less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.75):** Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with this field. His empathy and warm-heartedness are also significant indicators that this would be his most likely field of study.
