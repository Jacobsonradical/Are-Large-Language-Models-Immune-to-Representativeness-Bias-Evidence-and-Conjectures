Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer how well his characteristics align with the typical interests and skills in each of the given fields. Here's the estimated posterior conditional probability for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65
}

These probabilities reflect that while Adam's intelligence and problem-solving abilities could align with computer science, his empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature strongly suggest a fit in agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration, on the other hand, appears less aligned with his described interests and skills.
