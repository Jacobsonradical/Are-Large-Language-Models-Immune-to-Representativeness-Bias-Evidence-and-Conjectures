Considering the details provided in Adam's personality sketch, I can make informed estimates of the conditional probabilities for each of the specified fields of graduate study:

1. **Computer Science:** Adam has high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, which are important attributes for computer science. However, there is no specific mention of a strong interest or skills directly related to technology or programming.
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy make agricultural and veterinary science a strong contender. His personality traits align well with the interests and values often found in this field.
3. **Business Administration:** Although Adam has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, there is little in the personality sketch to suggest a particular interest or aptitude for business administration. His characteristics seem more aligned with fields related to nature and animals than business.

Given these considerations, here are my estimates:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
