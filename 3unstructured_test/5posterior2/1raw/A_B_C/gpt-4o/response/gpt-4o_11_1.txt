Given Adam's personality sketch, I will estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for each field based on the information provided. These are subjective estimates and should be taken with caution.

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.
- He was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.

Given these points, here's how the probabilities might look:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

### Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field. These attributes are essential for success and satisfaction in agricultural and veterinary science.
  
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While appreciation for hard work and dedication are important in business administration, Adam's other traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) are not as directly related to this field. Therefore, the probability is lower.
  
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence with abstract concepts align with skills needed in computer science. While his love for nature and animals do not directly relate to this field, his intellectual traits do support some likelihood he could be pursuing studies in computer science.
