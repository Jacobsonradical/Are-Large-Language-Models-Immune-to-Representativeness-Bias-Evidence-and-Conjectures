Given Adam's personality sketch, let's estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for the fields mentioned:

1. **Business Administration**: While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are important in business administration, Adam's deep love for nature, plants, and animals, along with his warm-hearted and empathetic nature, suggests that he is less likely to be in this field. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.
   
2. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is highly intelligent, which are traits typically associated with success in computer science. However, his strong appreciation for nature and animals suggest that his primary interests might lie elsewhere. So, the probability is moderate but not very high.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns strongly with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his warm heart and empathy. Therefore, the probability is high for this field.

So the estimates could be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```
