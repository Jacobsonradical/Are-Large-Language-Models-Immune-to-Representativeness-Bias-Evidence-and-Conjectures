Based on the personality sketch provided, we can make some inferences about the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each specified field. 

1. **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, it seems likely but not strongly indicated compared to his affinity for nature and animals. Furthermore, his warm heart and empathy might suggest he would prefer a field with more direct positive impacts on living beings.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication make this field a strong candidate. His empathy and warm heart also align well with a profession dedicated to animal welfare and nature conservation.

3. **Business Administration**: This field does not seem to align strongly with Adam's interests and personality traits centered around nature, animals, and empathy. While his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be beneficial in business, the sketch does not provide evidence of interests or skills particularly relevant to business administration.

Based on the above reasoning, the estimated posterior conditional probabilities might be:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
