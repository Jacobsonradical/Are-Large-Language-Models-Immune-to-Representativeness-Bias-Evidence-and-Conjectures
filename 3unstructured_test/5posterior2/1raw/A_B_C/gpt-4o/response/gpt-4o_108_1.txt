Given the personality sketch provided for Adam, we can try to estimate the probabilities based on his characteristics and interests. Here is the breakdown:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - He has strong empathy and a warm heart.
   These traits are strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science, as these fields often involve a deep connection with nature and animals.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - While Adam has high intelligence and a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, there is little in the sketch to suggest a particular interest in business administration.
   - There is no mention of an interest in business, entrepreneurship, or organizational leadership.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are important skills in computer science.
   - However, there is no direct mention of interest in technology, coding, or computer systems in the sketch.
   - His love for nature and animals suggests he might prefer a field that more directly involves these interests.

Based on the above reasoning, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.30
}
```

These values reflect the degree to which Adam's personality traits and interests align with each of the fields.
