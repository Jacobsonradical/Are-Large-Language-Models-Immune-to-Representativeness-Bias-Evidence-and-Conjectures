Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make educated estimates for the probability that he was enrolled in each of these fields. Let's analyze how well his traits align with each field:

1. **Business Administration**: This field often attracts individuals who are interested in management, leadership, and organizational skills. Adam's quiet nature, empathy, and love for animals suggest a temperament less aligned with the competitive and social nature typically associated with business administration.

2. **Computer Science**: This field attracts individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which aligns well with Adam's high intelligence and problem-solving skills. However, his deep love for nature and animals is less directly relevant to this field.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field seems to align very well with Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his empathy, and his love for animals. His appreciation for hard work and dedication is also a good fit for the demands of agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Given this analysis, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
