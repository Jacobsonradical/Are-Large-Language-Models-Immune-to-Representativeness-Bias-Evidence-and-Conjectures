Given Adam's personality sketch, his deep love for nature, animals, and plants, his empathy, warm heart, and his high intelligence for understanding abstract concepts, let's analyze the probabilities for each field.

1. **computer science**: While his high intelligence and love for solving puzzles could be a good match for computer science, his deep connection to nature and animals makes it less likely that this is his primary focus of study.

2. **agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, appreciation for plants, and love for animals strongly correlate with this field. His warm heart and empathy further suggest a career where he can care for living beings.

3. **business administration**: Although business administration involves the understanding of abstract concepts and could benefit from his intelligence, it doesn't align as strongly with his love for nature and empathy compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on the above analysis, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These estimates represent the conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each respective field, given his personality sketch.
