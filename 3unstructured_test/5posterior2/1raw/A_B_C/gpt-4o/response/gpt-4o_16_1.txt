Based on Adam's personality sketch, here are my best estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities that he was enrolled in each given field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.20,
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.60
}
```

Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and love for animals, it seems highly likely that he is involved in a field that works closely with these interests, such as agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, as well as appreciation for hard work and dedication, could apply to any of these fields, but the connection to his stated interests makes agricultural and veterinary science the most probable.
