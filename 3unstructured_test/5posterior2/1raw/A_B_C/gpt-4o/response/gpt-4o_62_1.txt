Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the posterior conditional probability for each field of study. Given his interests and qualities, agricultural and veterinary science seems like a strong fit due to his love for nature, plants, and animals. Computer science could also be a decent fit due to his high intelligence and affinity for puzzles, which often involve abstract thinking. Business administration seems to be the least likely given Adam's personality and interests.

Here are the estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
