Based on Adam's personality sketch, we need to evaluate how likely it is that he would be enrolled in each of the given fields. We can assess this using the information provided about his interests, skills, and tendencies.

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work make it very likely that he might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, as these areas directly align with his interests and empathy for living beings.

His enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts could align well with computer science, though there is less direct mention of an interest in technology or programming in his personality sketch.

Business administration seems less likely based on his described personality. While an appreciation for hard work could certainly align with business administration, there is no particular mention of interests or traits that are distinctly related to business, management, or economics.

Given these considerations, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These estimates reflect a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science due to the strong alignment with Adam's interests and traits, a moderate probability for computer science due to his intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles, and a lower probability for business administration due to the lack of directly related traits or interests.
