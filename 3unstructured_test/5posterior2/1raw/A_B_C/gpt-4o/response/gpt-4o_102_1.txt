Based on Adam's personality sketch and his background as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, we can estimate the probabilities for his enrollment in each specified field as follows:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, there is a significant likelihood that he could be enrolled in this field. This field matches many aspects of his interests and personality traits.
2. **Business Administration**: Adam's traits indicate a passion for nature and empathy, which don't strongly align with business administration. Although his intelligence and abstract thinking could be assets in business, the given personality sketch suggests this field is less likely.
3. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles, which are integral to computer science, and has high intelligence and abstract thinking abilities. However, his love for plants, animals, and nature might make this field less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
