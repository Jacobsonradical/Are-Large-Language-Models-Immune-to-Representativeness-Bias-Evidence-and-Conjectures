Let's analyze the given personality sketch and behavior traits of Adam:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and strong understanding of abstract concepts, which are characteristics that could align with computer science.
   - However, he has a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, which are not typically central themes in computer science.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align strongly with this field.
   - His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with the nature of agricultural and veterinary sciences, which often require a hands-on, dedicated approach.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - Business administration doesn't strongly connect with Adamâ€™s traits such as love for nature and animals or solving puzzles.
   - While high intelligence and an appreciation for hard work could be beneficial in this field, they are not as directly aligned with the personality sketch provided.

Given the above analysis, here are the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
