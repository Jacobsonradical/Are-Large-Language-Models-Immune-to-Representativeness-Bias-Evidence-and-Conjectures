To determine the posterior conditional probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we can consider how well his characteristics match typical personality traits and interests associated with each field. Keeping in mind that these are estimations and other fields could also be possibilities, here are the evaluated probabilities:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, along with his empathy and warm heart, it's very plausible that he could be in this field. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with this profession.
- **Computer Science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence with an ability to understand abstract concepts, which match well with computer science, his stronger interest in nature and animals makes this field slightly less likely.
- **Business Administration**: Even though Adam has intelligence and could thrive in this field, his personality sketch doesn't strongly align with the typical traits associated with business administration. There is no strong indication of interest in business-related activities.

Given these qualitative assessments, the estimated probabilities are:
