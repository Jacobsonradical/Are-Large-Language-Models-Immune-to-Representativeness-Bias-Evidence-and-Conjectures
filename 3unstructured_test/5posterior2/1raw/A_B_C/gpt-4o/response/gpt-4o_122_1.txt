Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can make some educated guesses about the posterior conditional probabilities of him being enrolled in each specified field. Let's break down each field with respect to the provided characteristics:

1. **Computer Science**: While Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are valuable traits for computer science, the description emphasizes his love for nature and animals, which are less directly related to the field of computer science. Therefore, while he could indeed have been in computer science, it seems less aligned with the core interests described.
    - Posterior Conditional Probability: \(0.2\)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, his deep love for animals, and his strong empathy, agricultural and veterinary science seems like a very fitting field for him. This field closely matches his interests and personal motivations.
    - Posterior Conditional Probability: \(0.7\)

3. **Business Administration**: Business administration does not appear to strongly align with the specific traits and interests described in his sketch, such as his empathy, love for nature, plants, and animals. The skills and interests outlined do not lend themselves as naturally to a business administration focus.
    - Posterior Conditional Probability: \(0.1\)

Thus, the probabilities can be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
