Estimating the posterior conditional probabilities involves evaluating how well Adam's personality traits and interests align with the typical characteristics and demands of each field. Here's my estimation:

1. **Business Administration**
   - Based on Adam's warm heart, strong empathy, and curiosity about nature, it seems less likely that he chose a field that is typically more focused on economics, management, and corporate strategy. His interests in nature and animals don't strongly align with business administration.
   - Estimated Probability: 0.05

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, and deep love for animals strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science. His empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication also fit well in this field, which involves working with animals and understanding their needs.
   - Estimated Probability: 0.7

3. **Computer Science**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are key attributes for success in computer science. However, his strong affinity for nature and animals may suggest that his primary interests are more aligned with fields directly involving those elements.
   - Estimated Probability: 0.2

Thus, the probability estimates are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
