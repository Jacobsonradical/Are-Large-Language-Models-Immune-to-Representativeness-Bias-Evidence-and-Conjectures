To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields given his personality sketch, we can rely on how well each field aligns with the details provided in his personality sketch.

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, indicating a strong alignment with fields related to agricultural and veterinary science.
2. His interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence could fit well with computer science, which heavily involves problem-solving and abstract thinking.
3. There is no specific information in the personality sketch that would strongly suggest a fit for business administration.

Given this information, I will assign probabilities that reflect these alignments:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These estimates reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being in a field that aligns strongly with his interest in nature and animals, while still acknowledging his problem-solving skills and intelligence, which could align him with computer science. Business administration is less likely given his personality sketch.
