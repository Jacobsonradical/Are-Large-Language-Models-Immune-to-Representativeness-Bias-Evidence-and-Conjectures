Given Adam's personality sketch, including his curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence, we can make some educated guesses regarding the probabilities of his field of study. Here are the estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

These values are based on the likelihood that his personality traits align with certain fields. His interests in nature, plants, and animals strongly suggest a fit with agricultural and veterinary science. However, his intelligence and capability for abstract concepts are also consistent with computer science, though his specific curiosity about nature implies a lower probability. Business administration is the least likely, given his personality traits indicating a focus on nature and empathy rather than business-oriented goals.
