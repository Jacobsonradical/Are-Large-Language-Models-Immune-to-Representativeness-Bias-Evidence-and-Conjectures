Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood of him being enrolled in each field can be estimated as follows:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly suggest a connection to fields that involve working closely with nature and animals. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with the demanding nature of agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, the probability of Adam being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is relatively high.

2. **Business Administration:** While business administration requires intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts, Adam's personality traits such as his deep love for nature and animals, and his enjoyment of quiet activities like solving puzzles, do not prominently align with typical business administration interests. Therefore, this field is less likely compared to others.

3. **Computer Science:** His high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts could suggest a propensity for Computer Science. Also, his enjoyment of solving puzzles fits well with the logical problem-solving nature of Computer Science. However, this field does not have as strong a connection to his love for nature and animals compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
