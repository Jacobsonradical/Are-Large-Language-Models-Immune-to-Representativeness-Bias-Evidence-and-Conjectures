Explanation: 

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication, it's highly probable that he is enrolled in this field. These interests align very closely with typical pursuits in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
  
- **Computer science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are relevant to the field of computer science. However, his stronger inclination towards nature and animals makes this less likely than the previous field.
  
- **Business administration**: Although there is an element of appreciation for hard work and dedication in business administration, Adam's primary interests and characteristics don't align well with this field, making it the least likely among the three options.
