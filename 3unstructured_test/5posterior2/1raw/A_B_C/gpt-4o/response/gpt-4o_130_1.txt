Based on Adam's personality sketch, the probabilities for different fields of graduate study can be estimated as follows:

- His curiosity about nature and various plants, along with his deep love for animals, strongly suggests a leaning towards agricultural and veterinary science.
- His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate he could also be a strong fit for computer science, especially since this field often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking.
- There is little in the personality sketch that specifically suggests an interest in business administration, which typically demands a focus on management, finance, and economics.

Given these considerations, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
