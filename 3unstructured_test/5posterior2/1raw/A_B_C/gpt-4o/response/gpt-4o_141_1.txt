Here's the reasoning behind these estimates:

- **Business Administration**: Based on Adam's personality sketch, there's a low likelihood that he is enrolled in Business Administration. His curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals don't align strongly with the typical interests and skills for this field, though it's possible he could be pursuing something like environmental management or sustainable business practices within this domain.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns very well with Adam's interests and personality. His genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication make it highly likely that he would find this field appealing and rewarding.

- **Computer Science**: While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are a good fit for Computer Science, his main interests seem to be more aligned with nature and animals. Therefore, while there is a moderate possibility that he could be in this field, it's less likely than Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
