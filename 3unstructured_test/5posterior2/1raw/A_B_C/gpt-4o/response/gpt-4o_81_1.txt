Given Adam's personality sketch, here are the best estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field. A strong appreciation for dedication and hard work also fits well with the demands of agricultural and veterinary sciences. As such, this field has the highest probability.
- **Business administration**: Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with typical characteristics most associated with business administration, such as an interest in economics, organizational dynamics, and strategic management. Consequently, this field has a low probability.
- **Computer science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and abstract thinking capabilities—traits that are valuable in computer science—his primary interests in nature and animals do not suggest a strong focus in this field. However, these skills being relevant to computer science give it a higher probability than business administration.
