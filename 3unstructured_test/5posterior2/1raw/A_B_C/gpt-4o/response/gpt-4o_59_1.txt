Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood of him being enrolled in each of the given fields. 

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This seems like a strong match due to Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart. His empathy and appreciation for hard work also align well with this field.

2. **Business Administration**: This seems less likely given Adam's personality traits. Business administration often requires strong interpersonal and leadership skills, which might not align as closely with Adam's quiet nature and preference for puzzles and abstract concepts.

3. **Computer Science**: This field could also be a reasonable fit given Adam's high intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles and abstract concepts. However, there is less explicit alignment with his love of nature and animals, making it somewhat less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.

Given this reasoning, my estimates are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
