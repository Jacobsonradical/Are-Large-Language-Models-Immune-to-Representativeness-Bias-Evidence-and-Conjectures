Given Adam's personality sketch, he has a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and a strong understanding of dedication and hard work. These characteristics make him highly compatible with fields related to nature, animals, and possibly logical thinking and empathy.

Here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,  // Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals aligns strongly with this field.
  "computer science": 0.2,  // His enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence could be relevant here, but the sketch does not strongly suggest this field.
  "business administration": 0.1  // There is little in the sketch to indicate an interest in business topics.
}

Note: These probabilities reflect estimations based on the given personality sketch and are subjective.
