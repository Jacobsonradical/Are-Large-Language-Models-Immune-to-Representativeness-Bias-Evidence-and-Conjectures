Given Adam's personality sketch, let's estimate the probabilities for each field:

- **Business Administration**: Adam's traits such as a love for nature, puzzles, empathy, and animals seem less aligned with the typical traits associated with business administration, which often requires strong interests in economics, management, and finance. Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration would be relatively low.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with the characteristics of someone in agricultural and veterinary science. This field seems highly probable based on his personality sketch.

- **Computer Science**: Adam is described as having high intelligence and being good at understanding abstract concepts, which are important traits in computer science. However, there is no direct mention of an interest in technology or programming, so while it is possible, it is less supported by the sketch compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.20
