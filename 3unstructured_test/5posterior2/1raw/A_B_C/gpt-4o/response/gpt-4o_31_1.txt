Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the posterior probabilities for each field as follows:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Strong interest in nature, plants, and animals suggests a high probability.
   - Empathy and a warm heart are characteristics often seen in this field.
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work also align with this field.
   - Estimate: **0.7**

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles, indicating a good fit for computer science.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are relevant here.
   - However, there's more emphasis on his love for nature and animals which might make this less likely.
   - Estimate: **0.4**

3. **Business Administration**:
   - This field doesn't align as well with the given personality traits.
   - While understanding and appreciation for hard work are important in business, the other traits like empathy, love for nature, and solving puzzles are less indicative of a preference for business administration.
   - Estimate: **0.2**

So, the estimates would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
