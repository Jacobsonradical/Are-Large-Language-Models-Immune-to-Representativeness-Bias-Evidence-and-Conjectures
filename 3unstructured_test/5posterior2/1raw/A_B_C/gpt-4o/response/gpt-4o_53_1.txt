Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can consider how well his traits align with each field.

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are strong fits for this field. 
   - Enjoying solving puzzles also aligns well with this field. 
   - A quiet nature can be beneficial for the focused work often required in this field.
   - Still, given his deep love for nature and animals, this may slightly lower the probability for this field.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - While high intelligence and understanding hard work and dedication are beneficial for business studies, his personality does not particularly highlight traits like strong leadership, strategic thinking, or a primary interest in business dynamics.
   - His warm heart, empathy, and preference for nature-related topics might make this a less likely field for Adam.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Given his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, this field seems highly aligned with his interests and personality.
   - His warm heart and empathy also align well with careers focused on animal care and agriculture.

Given these assessments, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
