Based on Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for the given fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.20,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.60
}

Explanation:
- **Business Administration:** Given Adam's strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals and nature, he seems less likely to be in a field like business administration, which traditionally focuses more on management, finance, and organizational behavior.
- **Computer Science:** While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with a good grasp of abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, his strong empathy and love for animals and nature make this field somewhat less likely but still plausible.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals strongly suggest he might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field aligns well with his interests and personality traits.
