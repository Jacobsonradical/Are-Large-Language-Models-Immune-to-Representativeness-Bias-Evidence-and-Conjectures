Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here's an estimation of the posterior conditional probabilities that he was enrolled in each of the provided fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

To clarify:
- Given Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature, it seems highly probable that he might be involved in agricultural and veterinary science.
- While his interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence could make computer science a feasible field, it doesn't align as strongly with his empathy and love for nature and animals.
- Business administration seems least likely given the personality traits described, which do not prominently align with typical motivations for entering that field.
