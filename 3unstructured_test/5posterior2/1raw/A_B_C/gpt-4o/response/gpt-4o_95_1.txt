To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, I'll consider how well his traits match typical attributes and interests commonly associated with students in those fields. 

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, deep love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, the fields of agricultural and veterinary science and potentially computer science appear more likely than business administration, whose focus does not typically align as closely with his described personality traits.

Here is my estimation:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.20
}
