  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

The reasoning behind these estimates is as follows:

- **Computer Science (0.3)**: While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align with the skills required in computer science, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals doesnâ€™t point strongly in this direction.

- **Business Administration (0.1)**: The personality sketch does not provide significant indicators that Adam has a particular interest or skills related to business administration. His traits align more with fields that closely connect to nature and animals.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his empathy and love for animals make it much more likely that he would be pursuing studies related to agricultural and veterinary science. This field aligns well with his interests and personality traits.
