Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have a strong affinity for nature, empathy, and animals, which aligns closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His intellectual capabilities and appreciation for hard work might make him suitable for computer science, but the personality traits suggest a stronger fit for the agricultural and veterinary sciences. Business administration seems less likely given the sketch, but still possible, particularly if his interest in hard work and dedication translates to an interest in leadership or entrepreneurship.
