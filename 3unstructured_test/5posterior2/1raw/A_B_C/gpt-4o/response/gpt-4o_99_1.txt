Explanation:
- **Computer Science:** Given that Adam is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, there's a reasonable chance he could be in a field like computer science. However, his strong interest in nature and animals makes this less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** His genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals strongly align with this field. His empathy and warm heart also fit well with the dedication required in veterinary and agricultural sciences.
- **Business Administration:** There is the least alignment here considering Adam's specific interests in nature and animals, as well as his preference for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.
