Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the probabilities for his enrollment in each field. 

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, appreciation for plants, and profound love for animals strongly align with this field. His empathy and understanding of hard work also fit well with the practical and caring aspects of agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Business Administration**: There is less direct alignment between Adam's personality (love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles) and business administration. While his intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant traits for any graduate field, they are not specific indicators of business administration.

3. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are important traits for computer science. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals doesn't align as directly with computer science as it does with agricultural and veterinary science.

Given this reasoning, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
