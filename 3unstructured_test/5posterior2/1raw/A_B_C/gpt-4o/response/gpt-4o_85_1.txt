Given the personality sketch of Adam, let's assess the likelihood of each field based on the provided traits:

Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and loves plants and animals, which strongly indicates a natural inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. His empathy and love for animals further reinforce this. 

Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with a good grasp of abstract concepts, which are key traits for someone in computer science. This field often appeals to individuals who appreciate logical thinking and problem-solving.

On the other hand, while appreciation for hard work and dedication are general attributes that could fit many fields, there's no direct trait connection that suggests an obvious fit for business administration.

Given this analysis, here's the estimated posterior conditional probability:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
