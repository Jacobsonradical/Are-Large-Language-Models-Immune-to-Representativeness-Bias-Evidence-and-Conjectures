Based on Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities that he was enrolled in each field in 2021:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- **Business administration**: Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and his preference for quiet activities like solving puzzles, it seems relatively unlikely that he would be enrolled in a field like business administration, which often requires more extroverted and social activities.
  
- **Computer science**: Adamâ€™s high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might suit computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals and nature are not as closely aligned with typical characteristics expected of someone in this field. Thus, a moderate possibility but not the highest.
  
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, agricultural and veterinary science seems to be the most fitting field for Adam.
