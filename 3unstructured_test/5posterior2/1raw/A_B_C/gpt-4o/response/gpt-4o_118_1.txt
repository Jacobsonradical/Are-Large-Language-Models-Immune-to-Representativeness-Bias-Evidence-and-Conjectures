Given Adam's personality sketch and the characteristics described, we can estimate the posterior probabilities for each field as follows:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this field seems very plausible.

- **Business Administration**: This field generally requires skills that might not align perfectly with Adamâ€™s described interests and personality traits, such as a quiet demeanor and interest in solving puzzles, unless he has a specific interest in environmentally-conscious business practices, though this is less stated.

- **Computer Science**: Although Adam's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators that align well with computer science, the sketch does not particularly emphasize a specific interest in technology or computing.

Here are the estimates:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
