Based on Adam's personality sketch, he appears to have a strong inclination towards nature, plants, animals, and abstract thinking, with a passion for puzzles and empathy. Given these traits, here's an estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These probabilities are based on the alignment of Adam's interests and qualities with the characteristics typically associated with these fields. Agricultural and veterinary science seems to fit best given his love for nature and animals. Computer science is possible due to his high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, but seems less likely given the strong emphasis on nature and animals. Business administration appears to be the least likely given there is no mention of entrepreneurial or business interests in his personality sketch.
