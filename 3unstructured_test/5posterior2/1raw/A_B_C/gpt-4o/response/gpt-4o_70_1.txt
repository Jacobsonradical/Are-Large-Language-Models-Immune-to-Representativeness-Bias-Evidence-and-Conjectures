Based on Adam's personality sketch and considering the general traits and interests associated with each field, I will provide estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70
}

These estimates are based on the following reasoning:
- **Business administration**: Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with the typical interests and traits associated with business administration.
- **Computer science**: While Adam is intelligent and good at solving puzzles, which are traits valuable in computer science, his strong empathy and love for nature and animals are less typical in this field.
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, empathy, and love for animals are highly compatible with this field.
