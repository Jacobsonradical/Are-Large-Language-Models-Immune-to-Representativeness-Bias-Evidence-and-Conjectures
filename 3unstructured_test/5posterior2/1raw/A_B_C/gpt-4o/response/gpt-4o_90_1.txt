Certainly! Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can provide an estimate of the probabilities for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this field aligns closely with his characteristics. Thus, there is a relatively high probability that he would be enrolled in this field.
  
2. **Business Administration**: Although Adam has high intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts, his interests and attributes seem more aligned with nature, empathy, and animals rather than the skills typically associated with business administration (such as leadership, strategic thinking, and financial acumen). Therefore, the probability for this field is relatively low.
  
3. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are important traits for computer science. However, there are no specific indications of a direct interest in computers, programming, or technology in the sketch. This field may still be of moderate probability for Adam, but not as high as agricultural and veterinary science.

Given this analysis, here are the estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values are rough estimates based on the provided personality sketch and could vary with more detailed information.
