Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated estimates regarding the probability of him being enrolled in each given field:

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which are traits often found in computer science students.
   - However, there is no specific mention of an interest in technology or coding.
   - Estimate: 0.3

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - This field aligns very well with his interests and skills.
   - Estimate: 0.6

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam has strong empathy and a warm heart, which could be useful in business, particularly in roles involving people management.
   - However, there is no direct evidence that his personality sketch aligns with the typical interests and skills of a business administration student.
   - Estimate: 0.1

So, the posterior conditional probabilities estimate might look like this:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
