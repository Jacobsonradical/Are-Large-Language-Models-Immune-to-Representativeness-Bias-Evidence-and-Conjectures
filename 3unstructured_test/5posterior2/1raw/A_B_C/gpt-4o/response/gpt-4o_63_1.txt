Given Adam's personality sketch, we can use his characteristics and interests to estimate the probability of his enrollment in various fields of study. Here’s a breakdown of how each field aligns with his personality traits:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals. His empathy and deep love for animals strongly point towards a field that involves working with nature and animals. Additionally, his appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns well with this field.

2. **Business Administration**: Adam’s described personality does not necessarily align with business administration. His interests seem more aligned with nature, animals, and abstract concepts rather than commerce, management, or business processes.

3. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which could align with computer science. His ability to understand abstract concepts also fits well within this field. However, his deep love for animals and nature might suggest that practical and outdoor-oriented fields might be a stronger fit.

Based on the personality sketch and considering how his traits align with each field, we can estimate the probabilities as follows:
