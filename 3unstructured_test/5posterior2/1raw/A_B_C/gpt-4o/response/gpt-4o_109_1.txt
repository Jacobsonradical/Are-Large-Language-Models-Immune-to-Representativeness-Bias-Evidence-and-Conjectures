  "business administration": 0.05,  // Business administration is less likely since his interests are more aligned with nature, animals, and abstract problem solving.
  "computer science": 0.3,  // Computer science is somewhat plausible due to his high intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of abstract concepts.
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,  // This field seems most aligned with his genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals.
