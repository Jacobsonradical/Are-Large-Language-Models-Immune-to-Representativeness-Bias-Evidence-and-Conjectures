Given Adam's personality sketch, I will provide estimates for the probabilities he was enrolled in specific graduate fields:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are relevant traits for computer science. However, there is no direct indication in his sketch that he has a specific interest in computer science or related activities such as programming or technology. Therefore, while he could excel in this field, his sketch does not strongly point towards it.
   - Estimated probability: 0.2

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a strong appreciation for nature, plants, animals, and hard work. He also has a warm heart and strong empathy, which are important traits for someone working with animals. These aspects of his personality are highly aligned with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Estimated probability: 0.7

3. **Business Administration**: While Adam has high intelligence and problem-solving skills which are valuable in business, his personality sketch does not indicate a specific interest or alignment with this field. There is a notable absence of traits related to leadership, economics, management, or an explicit interest in commerce.
   - Estimated probability: 0.1
