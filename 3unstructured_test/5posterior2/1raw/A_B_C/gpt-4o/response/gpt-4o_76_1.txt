Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have traits that would align him with a field that involves a love of nature, animals, and possibly a hands-on understanding of the world around him. His attributes seem less aligned with business administration and only moderately with computer science, given his curiosity and intelligence, but more so with agricultural and veterinary science.

Here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood for Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his interests and personality traits, with computer science being a secondary possibility due to his intelligence and ability to solve puzzles, but less probability for business administration given thereâ€™s no specific alignment of his traits to that field.
