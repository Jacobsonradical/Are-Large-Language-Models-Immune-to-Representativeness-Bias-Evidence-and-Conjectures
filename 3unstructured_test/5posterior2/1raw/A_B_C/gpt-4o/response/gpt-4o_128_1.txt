Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

These estimates consider Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, which align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest some probability for computer science, but his traits do not strongly align with business administration.
