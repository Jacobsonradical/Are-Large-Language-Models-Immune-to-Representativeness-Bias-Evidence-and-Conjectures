Given Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with the skills needed in computer science, but his specific interest in nature, plants, and animals makes this field somewhat less likely, albeit still a possibility given his intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities.
- **Business Administration (0.1):** While appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant, the lack of specifics about interest in business, economics, or leadership suggests that this field is less likely for Adam.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):** Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work make this field the most likely among the three given its strong alignment with his interests and personality traits.
