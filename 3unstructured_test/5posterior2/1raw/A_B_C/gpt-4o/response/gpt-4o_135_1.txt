Given Adam's personality sketch and interests, we can make some informed guesses about the likelihood of his enrollment in the given fields. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and good understanding of abstract concepts, there is a reasonable chance he could be in this field. However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and love for animals might make it slightly less likely compared to other fields that align more closely with those traits.

2. **Business Administration**: While Adamâ€™s high intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication could suit business administration, his interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy do not particularly align with the typical traits or interests of someone in this field. 

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field seems to align the most closely with Adam's personality sketch. His genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are perfect fits for someone involved in agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Given this analysis, my best estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
