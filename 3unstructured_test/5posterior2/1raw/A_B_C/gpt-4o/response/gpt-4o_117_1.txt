Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, he shows a strong curiosity about nature, an affinity for animals, empathy, and a preference for abstract thinking. These traits can help us estimate the conditional probabilities for the specified fields:

1. **Computer Science:** While Adam is intelligent and enjoys solving puzzles, the sketch does not mention an interest in technology, programming, or related domains, which are typically associated with computer science. Therefore, the probability might be relatively lower.
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this field aligns closely with his interests and personality traits. Thus, the probability for this field is likely higher.
3. **Business Administration:** Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work could be applicable in business administration, but there is no direct mention of interest in business concepts or management, making this probability intermediate but lower than for agricultural and veterinary science.

Here are the estimates:
