Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, we can infer certain probabilities for his field of study:

1. Agricultural and veterinary science: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals. These traits strongly align with this field of study, making it a high probability that he is enrolled in this field.

2. Computer science: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts well. These traits are beneficial for computer science, but the personality sketch emphasizes more on nature and animals, which reduces the likelihood compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

3. Business administration: While Adam's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are important traits for business administration, the sketch does not provide strong direct indications of interest in business or administrative skills.

Given these considerations, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
