Based on Adam's personality sketch and his interests, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for each field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

**Explanation:**

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):** Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals aligns closely with this field. His empathy and warm heart also suggest a fit for a field that involves care for living beings. 

- **Computer Science (0.2):** While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are traits that fit well with computer science, his primary interests seem to be more aligned with natural sciences and living organisms.

- **Business Administration (0.1):** Adam's personality traits and interests in nature, plants, and animals do not strongly align with business administration. While he has an appreciation for hard work and dedication, these attributes alone do not strongly suggest a probability towards business administration based on the provided sketch.
