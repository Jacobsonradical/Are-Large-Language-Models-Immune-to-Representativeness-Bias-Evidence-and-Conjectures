Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can analyze how likely he was to be enrolled in each of the given fields:

1. **Computer Science**: Given his high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, it is plausible that Adam could excel in computer science. However, his pronounced curiosity about nature, empathy, and deep love for animals do not directly align with typical motivations for entering this field.

2. **Business Administration**: Although Adam has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, the sketch lacks indications of an interest in the economic, managerial, or corporate themes that usually draw people to business administration.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and empathy are highly consistent with enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these considerations, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
