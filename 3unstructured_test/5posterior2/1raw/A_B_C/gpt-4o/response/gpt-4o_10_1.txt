Based on Adam's personality sketch and his interests, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for each given field:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a strong empathy, and a love for animals. This strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts, which are important in fields like computer science, but there is no explicit mention of interest in technology.
- There is no strong indication in the personality sketch that suggests an inclination towards business administration.

Given these observations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science due to Adamâ€™s evident interests and characteristics, while computer science is somewhat plausible based on his analytical skills. Business administration seems less likely given the provided information.
