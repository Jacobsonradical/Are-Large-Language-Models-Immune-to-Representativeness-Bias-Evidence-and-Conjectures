Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some inferences about the likelihood of him being enrolled in the given fields:

- Agricultural and veterinary science: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, which fits well with this field's focus. His empathy and love for animals are particularly strong indicators. His understanding and appreciation for hard work also align with the practical, often labor-intensive nature of this field.

- Business administration: While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could apply to business, his personality sketch strongly emphasizes his affinity for nature and animals, which are less commonly the focus in business administration. This makes it a less likely match.

- Computer science: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, which suggests he might do well in computer science. However, the sketch does not indicate a specific interest in technology or computing, which makes this field a bit less probable than agricultural and veterinary science, though it's still a possibility given his problem-solving skills and intelligence.

So, the posterior conditional probabilities might be estimated as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
