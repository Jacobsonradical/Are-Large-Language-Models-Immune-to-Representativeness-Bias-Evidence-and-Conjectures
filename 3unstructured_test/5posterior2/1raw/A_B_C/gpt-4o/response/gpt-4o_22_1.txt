Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some inferences about the likelihood of him being in each of the given fields. Here are the posterior probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits strongly align with a field focused on agriculture and veterinary sciences.
   - **Estimated Probability**: 0.6

2. **Computer Science**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science. However, there's less direct evidence from his personality sketch to link him to this field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **Estimated Probability**: 0.3

3. **Business Administration**
   - While Adam's traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work can be valuable in business administration, there are no specific indicators in his sketch that strongly suggest a preference for this field. Additionally, his interests in nature, plants, and animals make it less likely that he pursued business administration.
   - **Estimated Probability**: 0.1

So, the estimates are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
