Given Adam's personality sketch and interests, we can make some informed estimates about the likelihood of him being enrolled in various graduate fields. Here are the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.60,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Computer Science (0.15)**:
    - While Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which are traits that might be favorable in computer science, there is no strong indication that his interests lie specifically in this field. His curiosity about nature and love for animals suggest he might be more inclined toward a life sciences-related field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.60)**:
    - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, interest in plants, strong empathy, and love for animals align well with this field. His deep appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with the hands-on and involved nature of agricultural and veterinary studies.

3. **Business Administration (0.05)**:
    - There is limited information making a direct connection between Adam's described personality traits and business administration. While he might understand and appreciate dedication, his specific interests (nature, plants, animals) do not strongly align with a typical business administration curriculum.
