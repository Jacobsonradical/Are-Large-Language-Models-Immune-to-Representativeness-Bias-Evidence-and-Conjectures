Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can estimate the conditional probabilities for each field based on how well his traits and interests align with each discipline. 

1. Business Administration: Considering Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, he seems less aligned with the typical interests and skills associated with business administration, which often focuses on management, finance, and corporate strategy. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.
   
2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, combined with his empathy and understanding of hard work and dedication, makes him a strong candidate for this field. This field directly aligns with his interests and personality traits, so this probability is high.
   
3. Computer Science: Though Adam enjoys solving puzzles and possesses high intelligence and an aptitude for abstract concepts, which are relevant qualities for computer science, his strong inclination towards nature and animals suggests that he might prioritize a field more aligned with these interests. Therefore, the probability is moderate.

Let's quantify these assessments:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.80,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
