Considering Adam's personality sketch and his interests, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood of his enrollment in each field.

1. His genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, as well as his deep love for animals, strongly suggest a connection to agricultural and veterinary science.
2. His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could also be indicative of an interest in computer science.
3. There is relatively little in his personality sketch to strongly suggest an inclination towards business administration.

With these considerations in mind, the posterior conditional probabilities might be estimated as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

These values are approximate and based on the personality traits provided. The higher likelihood of agricultural and veterinary science is due to his evident interest in nature, plants, and animals. The significant probability for computer science considers his intelligence and love for puzzles. Business administration is less likely given the lack of relevant traits in the sketch.
