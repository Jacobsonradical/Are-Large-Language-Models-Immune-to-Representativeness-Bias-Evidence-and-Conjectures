Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and deep love for animals, it seems most likely that he would pursue a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well in computer science, but his personality traits and interests align better with agriculture and veterinary fields. Business administration appears less aligned with his specific interests and personality traits.
