Based on Adam's personality sketch, here's my best estimate of the posterior conditional probability that he was enrolled in each of the given fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.55,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, a strong probability is placed here.
- Business Administration: Adam's personality and interests do not particularly align with this field, leading to a lower estimate.
- Computer Science: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts make this a plausible field, but his empathy and love for nature slightly lower the probability compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
