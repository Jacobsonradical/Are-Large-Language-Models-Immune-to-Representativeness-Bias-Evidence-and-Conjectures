Based on the given personality sketch, here are my best estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each respective field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

### Rationale:
- **Computer Science (0.2):** Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align with skills needed in computer science. However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals are less characteristic of this field.
- **Business Administration (0.05):** While business administration values intelligence and dedication, it seems less aligned with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathetic nature.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):** Adam's curiosity about nature, knowledge of plants, and deep love for animals strongly indicate a predisposition towards agricultural and veterinary sciences. His appreciation for hard work also aligns well with this field, where dedication is crucial.
