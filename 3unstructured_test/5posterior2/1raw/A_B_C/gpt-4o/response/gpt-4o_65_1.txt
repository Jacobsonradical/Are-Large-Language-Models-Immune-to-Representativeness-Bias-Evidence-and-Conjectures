Based on Adam's personality sketch and his interests, here are the estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities for each of the given fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.35
}

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.05)**: Adam's personality traits, such as his love for nature, animals, and empathy, do not strongly align with the typical interests associated with business administration. Hence, the probability is low.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this field is a strong match for Adam's interests and personality. Therefore, this probability is the highest among the three.
- **Computer Science (0.35)**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are traits that align well with computer science, his strong empathy and deep connection to nature and animals make agricultural and veterinary science a slightly better fit. Nevertheless, the probability is still substantial.
