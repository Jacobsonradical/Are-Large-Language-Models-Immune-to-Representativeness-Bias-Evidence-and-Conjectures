Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make educated estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities that he was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it seems reasonable that he might have chosen a field that would allow him to engage directly with these interests. 
2. **Business Administration**: While Adam's high intelligence could certainly enable him to pursue a business administration degree, his stated interests and qualities don't particularly align with this field. The mention of curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals doesn't strongly suggest a focus on business.
3. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts, which are traits well-suited to computer science. However, his interests in nature and animals are less directly related to this field.

Using these considerations, the conditional probabilities are estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect Adam's apparent alignment with fields that involve nature and animals, while also acknowledging his capability in areas that require abstract thinking and problem-solving skills.
