Based on Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70
}

Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest that he might be inclined towards agricultural and veterinary science.
- Although his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align with a potential interest in computer science, there is less direct alignment with his stated interests and empathetic nature.
- Business administration seems less likely as it does not directly relate to his interests in nature, puzzles, empathy, and animals.
