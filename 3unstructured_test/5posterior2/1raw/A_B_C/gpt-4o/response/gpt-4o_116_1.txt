Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems more likely that he would be drawn to a field such as agricultural and veterinary science, where his love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy can play a significant role. Computer science might also be a possibility given his intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, but it seems less aligned with his deep appreciation for the natural world. Business administration appears to be the least likely field based on the provided description.
