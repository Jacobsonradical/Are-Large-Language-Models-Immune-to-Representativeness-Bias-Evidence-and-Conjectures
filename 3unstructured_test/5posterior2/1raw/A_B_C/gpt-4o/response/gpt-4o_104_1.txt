Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some reasonable estimates about the likelihood of his enrollment in each of the specified fields. 

1. **Computer Science**: Adam has a high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which are beneficial in this field. However, his interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy might not align as well with typical motivations for choosing computer science. Therefore, the probability isn't extremely high.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given his genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals, this field seems to strongly align with his interests and personality. Thus, this probability is notably high.

3. **Business Administration**: Adam's personality traits of curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals do not strongly suggest a particular interest in business administration. This field requires different primary interests and skills compared to what his personality sketch indicates. Therefore, the probability here would be lower.

Estimated probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.30,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.60,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
