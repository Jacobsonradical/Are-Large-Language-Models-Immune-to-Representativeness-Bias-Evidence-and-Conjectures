Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here are the best estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities for each field given his characteristics:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.05
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals heavily suggests a strong alignment with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him fit for computer science, though it's less aligned with his expressed interests. Business administration seems the least likely given his traits and interests.
