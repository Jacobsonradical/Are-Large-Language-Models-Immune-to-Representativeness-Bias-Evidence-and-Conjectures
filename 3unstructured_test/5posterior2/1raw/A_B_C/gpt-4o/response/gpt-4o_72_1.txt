The estimates are based on the given personality sketch and Adam's interests. His genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals align most closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts might make computer science plausible, though it does not fit as well with his other traits.
