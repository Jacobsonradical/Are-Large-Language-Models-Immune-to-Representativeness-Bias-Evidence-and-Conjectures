Given Adamâ€™s strong empathy, deep love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants, it is most likely that he would be enrolled in a field related to Agricultural and Veterinary Science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also make him a candidate for Computer Science, albeit to a lesser extent. Business Administration seems the least likely given the nature of his interests and personality traits.
