Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals, there is a high likelihood that he would be involved in a field related to agriculture or veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with the demands of this field.
  
- **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, his personality traits seem more aligned with natural sciences and empathy-driven fields, which makes this less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
  
- **Business Administration**: While Adam shows traits such as intelligence and an appreciation for hard work that are beneficial in business, his strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature suggest he is less likely to be drawn to business administration compared to other fields.
