Based on Adam's personality sketch, the probabilities for each field of specialization given his attributes are as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

These estimates are derived considering Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, which align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest some suitability for computer science, though it seems less aligned with his natural curiosity and empathy. Business administration seems the least likely of the three fields given the lack of traits such as an interest in leadership, commerce, or organizational behavior, which typically characterize students in that field.
