Based on Adam's personality sketch highlighting his curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, we can make informed estimates of the probabilities of his enrollment in different fields. Here's an assessment for each field provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

### Reasoning:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align very well with this field. Thus, this field seems highly probable.

2. **Business Administration**: Adam's personality traits don't strongly align with typical traits required for business administration. There are no indications in the sketch that suggest an interest in business, economics, or management, so this field seems less likely.

3. **Computer Science**: Although there is no direct mention of a technological interest, Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are traits that could fit well within computer science. Given his strength in understanding abstract concepts, this field remains a possibility.
