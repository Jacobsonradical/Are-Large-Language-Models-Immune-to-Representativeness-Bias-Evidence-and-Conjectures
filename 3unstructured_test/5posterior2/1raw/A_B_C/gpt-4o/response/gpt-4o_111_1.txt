  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.05
}

Here's the rationale behind these estimates:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals, it stands out as the most likely field of study. His empathy and appreciation for hard work also align well with what is required in this field.

2. **Computer Science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are traits that align with computer science, the other aspects of his personality like his love for nature and animals make this field slightly less likely.

3. **Business Administration**: This field typically aligns more with interests in leadership, management, and economics rather than Adam's stated interests and empathetic nature, making it the least likely among the three options provided.
