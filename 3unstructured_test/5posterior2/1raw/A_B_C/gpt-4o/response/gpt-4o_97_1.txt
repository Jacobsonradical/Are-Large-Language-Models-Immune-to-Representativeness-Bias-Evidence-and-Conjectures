Explanation: Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems very empathetic, has a love for nature, and is curious about plants and animals, which strongly suggests a connection to agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and abstract thinking align with both computer science and agricultural/veterinary fields, but his specific interests and empathy tilt the probability more toward agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration seems less likely due to the lack of any explicit interest in business or leadership mentioned in the personality sketch.
