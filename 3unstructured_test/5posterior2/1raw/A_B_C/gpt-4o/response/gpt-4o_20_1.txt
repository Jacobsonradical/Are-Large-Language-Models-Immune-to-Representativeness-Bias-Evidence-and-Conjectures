The reasoning behind these estimates is as follows:

- **Business administration**: Given Adam's strong empathy, curiosity about nature, and interest in solving puzzles, it seems less likely he would be enrolled in a business administration program, which often emphasizes financial, managerial, and strategic skills over empathy and a connection to nature. Therefore, the probability is quite low.

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam's love for nature and animals, combined with his appreciation for hard work and dedication, strongly suggest he could be interested in a field that allows him to work closely with plants and animals, making this a very likely field for him.

- **Computer science**: While Adamâ€™s intelligence and puzzle-solving ability are well-suited for computer science, his personality seems more aligned with natural sciences and empathy-driven fields. Thus, there's a moderate probability, but not as high as agricultural and veterinary science.
