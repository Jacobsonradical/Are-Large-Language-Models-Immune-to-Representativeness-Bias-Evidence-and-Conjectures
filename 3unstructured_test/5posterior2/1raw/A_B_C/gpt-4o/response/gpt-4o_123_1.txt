Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer some likelihoods about his graduate field of study. He shows a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a strong empathy and appreciation for hard work, which are more directly aligned with certain fields. Given these characteristics, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality sketch does not heavily suggest an interest in business or economics. The empathy and appreciation for hard work could translate to a wider range of leadership roles, but these qualities alone do not strongly indicate a focus in business administration, leading to a lower probability of 0.1.

- **Computer Science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts, which are relevant for computer science, his strong interest in nature, animals, and empathy suggest a higher likelihood that his interests lie elsewhere. Therefore, a moderate probability of 0.2 is reasonable.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field directly aligns with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals. His empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication also fit well within this field, leading to a high probability of 0.7.
