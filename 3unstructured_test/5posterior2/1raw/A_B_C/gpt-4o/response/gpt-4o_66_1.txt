Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can update the prior probabilities for each field of study. Adam has a strong connection to nature, plants, animals, and has a high level of empathy, which makes agricultural and veterinary science seem like a strong fit. His high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could also make computer science a plausible field. However, there are fewer direct personality clues pointing towards business administration.

Here are the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
