Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer his likelihood of being enrolled in different fields of graduate study. Given his genuine curiosity about nature, love of animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, he seems more aligned with fields that involve a deep understanding of living organisms and their environments, or require strong problem-solving and abstract thinking skills. Here's a reasonable estimate:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

- *Agricultural and veterinary science* (0.6): Adam's expressed interest in nature, plants, and animals, combined with his empathy, makes this field a good fit.
- *Business administration* (0.1): While intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant here, the lack of specific interest in business-related concepts in his personality sketch makes this a less likely field.
- *Computer science* (0.3): His enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts fits well with this field, though there's less indication of a specific interest in technology or computing in his personality sketch compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
