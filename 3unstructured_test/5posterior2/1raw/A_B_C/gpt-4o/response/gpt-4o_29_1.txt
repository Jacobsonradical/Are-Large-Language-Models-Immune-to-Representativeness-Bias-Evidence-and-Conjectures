Explanation: Based on Adam's personality sketch, he has a strong affinity for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, indicating that agricultural and veterinary science is the most probable field for him. His warmth and empathy align well with caring for animals. Computer science is also a plausible field due to his high intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities, although it is less aligned with his interest in nature. Business administration is the least probable given his personality, as it typically requires different skills and interests that are not highlighted in his description.
