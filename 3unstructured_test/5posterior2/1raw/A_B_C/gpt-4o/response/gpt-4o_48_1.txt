{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

- **Computer science**: While it's possible Adam could be in this field due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills, his personality and interests seem more aligned with nature and animals.
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: This field aligns well with Adam’s love for nature and animals, curiosity about plants, and empathy. Hence, this gets a higher probability.
- **Business administration**: Given Adam’s personality and interests, it's less likely he would be in business administration, which is often more oriented towards leadership, finance, and management skills. Hence, this has the lowest probability.
