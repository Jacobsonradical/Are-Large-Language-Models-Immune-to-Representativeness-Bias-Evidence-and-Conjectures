Given Adam's personality sketch and interests, we can estimate the posterior probabilities for each field as follows:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, which strongly aligns with this field. Therefore, the probability is quite high.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are important traits for computer science. However, this field does not strongly align with his interest in nature and animals, so the probability is moderate.

3. **Business Administration**: There is no specific information in Adam's personality sketch that strongly aligns with business administration. His interests and traits are more closely aligned with fields related to nature and animals, so the probability is relatively low.
