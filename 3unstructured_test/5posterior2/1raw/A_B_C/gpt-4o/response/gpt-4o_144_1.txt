{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Here's the rationale for these estimates:

1. **Computer Science (0.2)**: While Adam is described as intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which can be beneficial in computer science, the sketch does not align strongly with technology or programming interests.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.5)**: Adam has a clear love for nature, plants, and animals, which closely aligns with this field. His empathy and warm heart further suggest a potential fit in a field where caring for living things is crucial.

3. **Business Administration (0.1)**: Adam's personality traits do not strongly indicate a fit for business administration, which typically involves more human interaction and a different set of interests than those described in the sketch.
