Based on Adam's personality sketch and the information provided, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.5)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his strong empathy, and deep love for animals, it's quite likely he would be in a field closely related to the natural world and animal care.
- **Computer Science (0.2)**: Adam's high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit well with computer science, but his strong inclination towards nature and animals makes it less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could align with business; however, his interests in nature, animals, and empathy suggest it is the least likely field among the three provided.
