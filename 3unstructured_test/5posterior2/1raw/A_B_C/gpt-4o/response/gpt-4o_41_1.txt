Given the personality sketch of Adam, the following are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for each field based on the provided information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These estimates are based on the personality traits described, especially his genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, his love for animals, and his strong empathy. These characteristics are very much aligned with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts make computer science a plausible but less likely match. Business administration seems the least likely given the focus on nature, animals, and empathy.
