Given Adam's personality sketch, here's an estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities that he was enrolled in the specified fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.05, // While Adam's qualities like high intelligence and understanding of hard work are relevant, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals makes this field less likely.
  
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75, // Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals make this field highly probable for his graduate studies.
  
  "computer science": 0.20, // Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence fit this field, but his predominant interest in nature and animals makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
