Given Adam's personality sketch, here are the best estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities for each field of study:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These estimates are based on Adam's interests and personality traits. His love for nature, plants, and animals, coupled with his warm heart and empathy, strongly align him with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a possible interest in computer science, but his curiosity about nature and plants makes this less likely than agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration seems the least likely given the absence of related traits in his personality sketch.
