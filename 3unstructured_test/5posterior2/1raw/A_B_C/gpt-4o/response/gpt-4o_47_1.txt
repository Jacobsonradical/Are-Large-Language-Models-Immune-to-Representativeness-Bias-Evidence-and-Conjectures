Given Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields. Using the details provided about his interests, characteristics, and intelligence, we can infer likelihoods based on these factors.

Considering Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, his personality aligns most closely with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also suggest potential suitability for Computer Science, though his interests seem more aligned with natural sciences. Business Administration would likely be the least probable field given his inclinations.

Here are the estimated posterior probabilities:
