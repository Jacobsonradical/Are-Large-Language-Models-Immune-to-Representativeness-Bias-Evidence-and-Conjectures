Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Given Adam's interest in nature, animals, and empathy, it seems less likely that he would be studying business administration, as this field doesn't particularly align with his described personality traits. Hence, this field has a lower posterior probability.
  
- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make computer science a possible field of study. Additionally, his enjoyment of solving puzzles fits well with the analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science. However, the lack of a direct mention of an interest in technology or computers reduces the probability slightly.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns closely with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and deep love for animals. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well within the context of this field. Therefore, this field has the highest posterior probability.
