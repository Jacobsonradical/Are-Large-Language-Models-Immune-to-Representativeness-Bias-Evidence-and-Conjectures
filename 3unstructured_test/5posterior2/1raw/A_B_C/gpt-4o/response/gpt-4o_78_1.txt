Given Adam's personality sketch, we can analyze the likelihood of his enrollment in each field based on his traits and interests. Here's my best estimate:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

### Explanation:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.5):**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy. These characteristics are highly relevant to a field that focuses on the well-being of plants and animals. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well in this field.

2. **Computer Science (0.3):**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles, is of high intelligence, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits align well with computer science, which often involves complex problem-solving and abstract thinking. However, his other described interests don't strongly correlate with this field as much as they do with agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Business Administration (0.2):**
   - Business administration is less likely given his personality traits. Although Adam's appreciation for hard work is relevant, his primary interests in nature, animals, and empathy do not directly align with this field as much as they do with agricultural and veterinary science or even computer science.
