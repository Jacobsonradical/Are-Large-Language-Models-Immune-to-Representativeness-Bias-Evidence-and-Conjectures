Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer his likelihood of being enrolled in each field. The factors that stand out are his love for nature and animals, his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, and his appreciation for hard work. Using these qualities, we can estimate the probabilities for each field.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his warm heart, and love for animals, this field aligns very well with his interests. Therefore, the probability is higher.
  
- **Business Administration**: This field typically requires strong problem-solving skills and an analytical mindset. While Adam has these qualities (such as intelligence and appreciation for hard work), the description doesn't highlight a specific interest in business or leadership, making this field seem less likely.
  
- **Computer Science**: Adamâ€™s intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts would serve well in computer science, but the sketch lacks specific indications of interest in technology or programming, making this field moderately likely.

Here's the probability estimation:
