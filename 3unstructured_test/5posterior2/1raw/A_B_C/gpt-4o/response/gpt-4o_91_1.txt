Based on Adam's personality sketch, which includes a genuine curiosity about nature, a strong love for animals, high intelligence, an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, I would estimate the probabilities for the fields as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These estimates suggest that Adam's interests primarily align with agricultural and veterinary science due to his love for nature and animals. Computer science is also a plausible field due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills. Business administration, however, seems the least likely given his personality sketch.
