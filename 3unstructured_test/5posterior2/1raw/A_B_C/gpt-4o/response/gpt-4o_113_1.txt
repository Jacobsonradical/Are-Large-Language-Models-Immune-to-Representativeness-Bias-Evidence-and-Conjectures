Here's the reasoning behind this allocation:

* **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him a good fit for computer science. However, there's no strong indication in his personality sketch that he's particularly inclined toward technology or computing.

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns closely with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with the demands of this field. Hence, it has the highest probability.

* **Business Administration**: Given Adam's personality traits, there's little indication that he has a particular interest in the business world. While his intelligence and empathy could be assets in this field, the other aspects of his personality make it less likely compared to the other fields.
