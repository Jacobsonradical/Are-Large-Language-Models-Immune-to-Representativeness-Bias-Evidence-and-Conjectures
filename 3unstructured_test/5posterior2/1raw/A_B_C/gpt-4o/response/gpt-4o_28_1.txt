Given Adam's personality sketch, we can assess the likelihood of him being enrolled in each of the specified fields. Let's break it down:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with this field. This makes it more likely for him to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence with the ability to understand abstract concepts. These attributes align well with skills needed in computer science, although there is no explicit mention of technology or computing in his sketch.

3. **Business Administration**: There is little in Adam's personality sketch that directly ties to business administration. He does not show a specific interest in managing businesses, finance, or related areas that are typical of this field.

With these considerations, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with each field.
