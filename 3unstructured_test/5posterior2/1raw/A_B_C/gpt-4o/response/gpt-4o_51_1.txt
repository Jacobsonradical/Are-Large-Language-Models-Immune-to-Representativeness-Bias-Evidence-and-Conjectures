Given Adam's traits and interests, agricultural and veterinary science seems to align most closely with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. His quiet nature and affinity for solving puzzles connect well with fields like computer science as well, although it doesn't quite capture his empathy and love for animals to the same extent. Business administration seems to be a less likely fit given the described personality and interests.
