Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

Rationale:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals, this field seems to be the most likely fit for him.
- **Business Administration**: This field appears less likely given Adam's described interests and personality traits, which are more aligned with scientific and nature-oriented pursuits rather than business.
- **Computer Science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which could align with computer science, his interests seem more focused on the natural world rather than technology. However, it still remains a plausible option, hence the moderate probability.
