Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and plants, along with his empathy and dedication, it seems more likely that he would be drawn to a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and abstract thinking could also make computer science a reasonable field, but his personality traits do not align as strongly with this field compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration seems less likely based on his interests and personality traits.
