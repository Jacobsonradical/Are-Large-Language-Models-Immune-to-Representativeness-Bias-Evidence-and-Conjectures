Based on Adam's personality sketch, the following is the estimated posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

Reasoning:
- Business Administration: Given Adam's deep love for animals, nature, and his empathetic disposition, it seems unlikely that he would pursue a field like business administration, which generally does not revolve around these interests. Therefore, the probability is fairly low.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: This field aligns very well with his interests in nature, plants, and animals. His curiosity and empathy make it highly probable that he is involved in this field, hence the high probability.
- Computer Science: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which suits computer science, his strong inclinations towards nature and animals suggest it is less likely than agricultural and veterinary science but still more probable than business administration.
