Based on the personality sketch of Adam, who has a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, a quiet demeanor, intelligence, and empathy, we can estimate the probabilities for his enrollment in different fields as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Considering Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, this field appears to be the most likely fit for his graduate studies. His empathy and appreciation for hard work also align well with the demands of this field.
- **Computer Science**: Though Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts, there is less specific information pointing directly to this field compared to the strong signals for agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Business Administration**: There is little in the description of Adam's personality and interests that points towards business-related studies, making this the least likely field among the three.
