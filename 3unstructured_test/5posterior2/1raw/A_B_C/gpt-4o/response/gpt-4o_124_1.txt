Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make some estimates about the probability that he was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align closely with agricultural and veterinary science, where interests in nature and animals are central. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be advantageous in any graduate field but are not uniquely indicative of one over the others.

Considering Adam's quiet disposition and interest in solving puzzles, he could potentially be a good fit for computer science as well, where these skills are certainly valuable. However, his described empathy and love for animals would more strongly indicate a fit in a field related to nature and living beings.

Business administration seems less likely based on the given information because there are no specific traits mentioned that would prominently align with the skill set or interests typically associated with this field.

Based on this analysis, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
