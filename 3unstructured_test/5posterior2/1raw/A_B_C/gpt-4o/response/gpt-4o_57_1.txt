Given Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for each field as follows:

1. **Business Administration**: 
   Adam's strong curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, and preference for solving puzzles do not strongly align with the typical traits of a business administration student. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.
   
   Estimation: 
   ```{
     "business administration": 0.1
   }```

2. **Computer Science**: 
   Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which are relevant traits for a computer science student. However, his strong focus on nature and animals might suggest his primary interests lie elsewhere. Therefore, the probability is moderate.

   Estimation:
   ```{
     "computer science": 0.3
   }```

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with the traits of a student in agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the probability is quite high.

   Estimation:
   ```{
     "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
   }```

Combining these estimations, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```
