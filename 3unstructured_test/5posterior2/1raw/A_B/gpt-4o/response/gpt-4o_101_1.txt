Based on the personality sketch provided, we can make some educated estimates about the likelihood of Adam's field of study. Here are the probabilities for each field, given the described traits:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.05
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. In contrast, his inclination doesn't seem to match the traits typically needed for business administration, such as a primary focus on financial metrics, management, and business operations. Thus, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood in agricultural and veterinary science and a much lower likelihood for business administration.
