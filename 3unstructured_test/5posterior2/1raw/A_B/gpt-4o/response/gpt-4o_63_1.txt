Based on Adam's personality sketch and his characteristics, he seems more inclined towards fields that involve nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving rather than fields focused on business and administration. Therefore, I would estimate the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
```

These estimates are reflective of Adam's natural curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, high empathy, and intelligence in abstract concepts, which align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration is less aligned with his described characteristics.
