Explanation:
Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems much more likely that he would be enrolled in a field related to his curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, which align closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts also support this field, as these qualities are valuable in scientific research and application involving natural sciences. 

Conversely, his personality traits do not particularly align with the typical traits associated with business administration, such as a focus on management, economics, or corporate environments. Hence, the probability for business administration is estimated to be much lower.
