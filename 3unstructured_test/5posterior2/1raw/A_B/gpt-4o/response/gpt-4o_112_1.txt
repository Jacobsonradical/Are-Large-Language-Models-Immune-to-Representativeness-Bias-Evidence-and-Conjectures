Based on Adam's personality sketch, here's my best estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.05
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, business administration seems less likely given his interests and personality traits.
