Based on Adam's personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Given Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and high empathy, it seems more likely for him to be enrolled in a field directly related to these interests, such as agricultural and veterinary science, rather than business administration.
