Adam's deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and his empathetic nature strongly suggest that he would be well-suited for a field like agricultural and veterinary science. These traits are highly congruent with the interests and skills needed in that field.

On the other hand, while his intelligence and appreciation for hard work could also be beneficial in business administration, the specific details of his personality sketch align less directly with the typical interests and priorities in that field. Therefore, the probability for business administration is estimated to be much lower.
