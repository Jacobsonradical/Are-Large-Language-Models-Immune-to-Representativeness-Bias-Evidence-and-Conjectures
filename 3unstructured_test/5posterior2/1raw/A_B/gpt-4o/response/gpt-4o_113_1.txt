Given Adam's personality sketch—his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work—the field of agricultural and veterinary science seems more aligned with his interests and characteristics than business administration. Here's my estimation of the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
Agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, while business administration seems less likely given his described personality traits.
