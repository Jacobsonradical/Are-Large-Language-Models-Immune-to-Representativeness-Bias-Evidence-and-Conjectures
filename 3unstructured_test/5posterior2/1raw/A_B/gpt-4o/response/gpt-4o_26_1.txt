Given Adam's personality sketch, it appears more likely that he would be enrolled in a field closely related to his interests and attributes. These attributes include a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. Here are the estimated conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

The rationale for these estimates is that agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals, whereas business administration does not directly relate to these interests.
