Based on Adam's personality sketch and known interests, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for the two given fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These estimates consider Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, which align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. His traits of empathy, intelligence, and understanding of hard work also support this alignment. On the contrary, these traits do not suggest a strong inclination towards business administration.
