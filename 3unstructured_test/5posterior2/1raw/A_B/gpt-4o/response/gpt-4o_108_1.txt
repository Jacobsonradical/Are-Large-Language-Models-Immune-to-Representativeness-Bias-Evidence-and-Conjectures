Given Adam's personality sketch—his curiosity about nature and plants, quiet demeanor, love for animals, high intelligence, empathy, and appreciation for hard work—it seems more likely that he would be drawn to a field that aligns with these traits. Agricultural and veterinary science appears to be a particularly good fit for his interests and characteristics, given his love for animals and nature. On the other hand, business administration seems less aligned with the described personality traits, particularly since it typically requires a different set of interests and skills.

Here is my estimation:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
