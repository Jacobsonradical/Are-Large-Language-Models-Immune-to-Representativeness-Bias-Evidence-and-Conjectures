Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated estimates about the likelihood that he was enrolled in each field. 

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, a warm heart, empathy, love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts also fit well into this field, as it can involve complex biological and environmental science topics.

In contrast, his personality traits and interests do not strongly align with business administration, which typically requires a different set of motivations and interests, such as a focus on corporate management, finance, or entrepreneurship.

Based on this reasoning, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

These estimates reflect a much higher likelihood that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality and interests, as compared to business administration.
