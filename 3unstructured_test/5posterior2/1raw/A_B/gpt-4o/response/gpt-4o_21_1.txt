Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for the hard work required in such fields, it's reasonable to think he'd be more likely to be studying agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet and empathetic personality, combined with his love for solving puzzles and high intelligence, also suits this field well. Business administration, lacking a direct connection to his interests and traits described, seems much less likely.
