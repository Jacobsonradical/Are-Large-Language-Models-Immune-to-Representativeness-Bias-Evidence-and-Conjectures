Based on the given personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses about Adam's field of study. It's important to consider that while personality traits and interests do correlate with certain fields of study, there is still uncertainty.

For business administration, Adam's traits suggest a strong empathy, appreciation for hard work, and high intelligence. Although these traits can be beneficial in business administration, his specific curiosity about nature, interest in plants, and deep love for animals are not directly aligned with the typical interests of a business administration student.

For agricultural and veterinary science, Adam's curiosity about nature, interest in plants, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with the typical characteristics of individuals in this field. His appreciation for dedication and hard work also fits well with the demanding nature of agricultural and veterinary studies.

Based on this reasoning, the following probabilities are estimated:

  "business administration": 0.1,
