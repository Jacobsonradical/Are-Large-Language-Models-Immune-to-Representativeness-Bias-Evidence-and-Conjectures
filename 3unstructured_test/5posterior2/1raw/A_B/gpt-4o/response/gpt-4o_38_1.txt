  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

The rationale behind these estimates is based on the strong alignment of Adam's personality traits and interests with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, such as his genuine curiosity about nature, his empathy, and his love for animals. On the other hand, while his high intelligence and appreciation for hard work could fit many fields, including business administration, his specific interests and traits seem less aligned with the typical traits associated with business administration, leading to a lower probability.
