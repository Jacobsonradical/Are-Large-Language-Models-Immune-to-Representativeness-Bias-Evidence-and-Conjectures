Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can make educated guesses about the probabilities that he was enrolled in each of the specified fields based on his traits and interests.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong understanding of hard work and dedication.
   - These characteristics align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, which involves working closely with plants, animals, and understanding the complexities of nature.
   - Given this close match, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high.

2. **Business Administration**: 
   - While Adam is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, there is no direct mention in his personality sketch of interests or skills directly related to business administration.
   - His traits such as empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not strongly align with the typical interests and skills associated with business administration.
   - Consequently, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low.

Based on these considerations, the probabilities are estimated as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
