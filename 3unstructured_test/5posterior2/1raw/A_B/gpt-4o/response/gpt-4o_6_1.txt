Sure, based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals suggest a higher probability that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His traits and interests align more closely with the practical and empathetic nature of this field. On the other hand, his quiet, puzzle-solving nature does not strongly suggest an inclination toward business administration, which typically demands more extroverted and strategic interaction.
