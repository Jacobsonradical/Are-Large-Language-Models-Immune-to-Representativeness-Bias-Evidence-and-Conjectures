Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some assessments regarding the likelihood of his enrollment in certain academic fields. 

Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and understanding of hard work point towards a higher probability in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. Conversely, business administration does not seem as strongly aligned with his described traits, especially given the absence of any business or management-related qualities.

Here are the assessments:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This suggests that Adam is significantly more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, given his personality sketch. Other factors not mentioned in the sketch might affect these probabilities as well.
