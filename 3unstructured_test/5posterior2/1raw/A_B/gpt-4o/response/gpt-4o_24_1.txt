Based on Adam's personality sketch, he has a strong appreciation for nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts, along with high intelligence and empathy. These traits align much better with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Conversely, the traits described do not align as closely with business administration, which typically requires skills and interests in areas like management, finance, and organizational behavior.

Given this, here are the posterior conditional probability estimates:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
