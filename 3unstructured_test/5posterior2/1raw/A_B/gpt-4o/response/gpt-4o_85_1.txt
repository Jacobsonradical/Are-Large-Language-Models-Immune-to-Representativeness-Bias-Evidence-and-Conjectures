Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and plants, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work align well with the personality traits suited for a career in agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, these traits do not strongly indicate an inclination towards business administration, which typically would connect more with interest in economics, management, finance, and perhaps less directly to nature and empathy-focused pursuits.
