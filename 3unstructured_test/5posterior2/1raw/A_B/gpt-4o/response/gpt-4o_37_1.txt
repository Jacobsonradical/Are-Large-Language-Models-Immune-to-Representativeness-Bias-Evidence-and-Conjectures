Given Adam's personality sketch, which highlights his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, it seems that agricultural and veterinary science would align closely with his interests and traits.

Here's an estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
