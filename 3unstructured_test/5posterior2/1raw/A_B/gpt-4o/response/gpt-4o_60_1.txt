Considering Adam's personality traits and his specific interests, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for the given fields as follows:

- Business Administration seems less aligned with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. Business programs typically attract individuals interested in organizational management, finance, marketing, etc., which don't seem to match Adam's traits. While it's not impossible for someone like Adam to be in this field, the probability is relatively low.

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science, on the other hand, fits very well with Adam's interests and traits. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work are indicative of someone likely to thrive in this field. 

So our estimates are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```
