Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong appreciation for hard work, it is more likely that he would be enrolled in a field directly related to these interests, such as agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration seems less aligned with his personality traits and interests as described. Thus, the posterior conditional probability for agricultural and veterinary science is higher than for business administration.
