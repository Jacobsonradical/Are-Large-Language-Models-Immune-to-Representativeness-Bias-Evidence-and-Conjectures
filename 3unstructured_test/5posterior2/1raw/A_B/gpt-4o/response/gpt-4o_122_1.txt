Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and his strong empathy and warm heart, it seems highly probable that he would be interested in a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and appreciation for hard work also align well with the rigorous demands of this field.

On the other hand, business administration seems less likely given his personality sketch. Although high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are important in business, his deep love for animals and nature does not strongly correlate with this field. Thus, the probability for business administration is considerably lower.
