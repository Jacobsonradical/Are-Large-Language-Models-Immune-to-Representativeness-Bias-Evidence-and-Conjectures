Given Adam's personality sketch, he appears more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science due to his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication in this field. His interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence could still be applicable in business administration, but those traits are more directly suited to the sciences related to nature and animals. Hence, I estimate a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science.
