Based on Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for the given fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

The higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science is due to Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedicationâ€”qualities that align well with this field. His quiet, empathetic nature and interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts seem less aligned with the typical interests and skills associated with business administration, thus lowering the probability for that field.
