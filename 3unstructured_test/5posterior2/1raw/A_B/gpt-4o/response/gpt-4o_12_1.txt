Based on Adam's personality sketch and background, I will provide an estimated posterior conditional probability for each of the mentioned graduate fields. Given his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication, it seems more likely that he might be involved in fields related to science, particularly those that deal with nature and animals. 

Here are the estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values reflect a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science given his interests, while the likelihood of business administration seems significantly lower based on his described personality traits and interests.
