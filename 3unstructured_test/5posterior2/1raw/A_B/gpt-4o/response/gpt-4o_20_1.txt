Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the probabilities for each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6

These values are derived considering Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his understanding of hard work and dedication, which align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.
