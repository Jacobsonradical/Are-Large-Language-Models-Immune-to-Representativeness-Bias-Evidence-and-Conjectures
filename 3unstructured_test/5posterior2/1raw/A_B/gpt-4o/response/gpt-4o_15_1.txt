Based on Adam's personality sketch, he displays a strong curiosity about nature, deep empathy for animals, and high intelligenceâ€”traits that align more closely with the field of agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration. His appreciation for hard work and problem-solving skills could fit into various fields, but his love for nature and animals makes agricultural and veterinary science more likely. 

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities might be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
