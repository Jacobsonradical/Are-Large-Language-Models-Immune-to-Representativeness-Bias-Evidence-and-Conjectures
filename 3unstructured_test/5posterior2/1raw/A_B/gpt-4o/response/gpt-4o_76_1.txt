Given Adam's personality traits, including his curiosity about nature and plants, warm heart, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems more likely that he would be involved in a field related to his interests in nature and animals. Consequently, the probability for agricultural and veterinary science would be higher than for business administration.

Here is my best estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.05
}

These values reflect the likelihood that Adam's interests and personality traits align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
