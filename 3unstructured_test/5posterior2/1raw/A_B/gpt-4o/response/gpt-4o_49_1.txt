Explanation:
Given Adam's personality sketch, there are several key attributes that fit well with agricultural and veterinary science, including his curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align strongly with fields related to agriculture and veterinary science.

On the other hand, while Adam's intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be beneficial in business administration, his strong empathy, love for nature, and preference for solving puzzles suggest a better fit with fields more directly related to his interests in nature and animals. Therefore, it is less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration.
