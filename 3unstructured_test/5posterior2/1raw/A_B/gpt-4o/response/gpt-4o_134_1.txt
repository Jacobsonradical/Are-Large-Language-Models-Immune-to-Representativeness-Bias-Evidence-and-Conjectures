Given Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathetic nature and appreciation for hard work, it seems more probable that he would be enrolled in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity about nature, coupled with his intelligence and love for animals, aligns well with the topics typically explored in this field.

On the other hand, business administration seems much less likely. While his intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be assets in that field, there is nothing in the personality sketch that directly points to an interest in business, making this a less probable choice.
