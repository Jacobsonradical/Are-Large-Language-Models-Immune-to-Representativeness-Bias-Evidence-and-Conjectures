Given Adam's personality traits—his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence, warmth, and empathy—the likelihood that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is considerably higher than his enrollment in business administration. His deep appreciation for nature and animals suggests a strong fit with agricultural and veterinary science. Conversely, his quiet and puzzle-solving nature doesn't typically align as closely with the more socially and commercially oriented field of business administration.
