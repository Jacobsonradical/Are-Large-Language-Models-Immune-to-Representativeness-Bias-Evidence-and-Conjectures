Explanation:

Given Adam's personality sketch, it is much more likely that he would have been enrolled in a field closely related to his interests and strengths. His genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, I have given it a high probability.

On the other hand, his skills and interests do not strongly indicate a propensity towards business administration, making it less likely that he was enrolled in that field. Therefore, I have given it a low probability.
