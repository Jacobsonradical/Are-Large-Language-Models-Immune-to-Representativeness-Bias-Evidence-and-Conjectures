Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make educated guesses regarding the likelihood of him being enrolled in various fields of study. Given his love for nature, plants, animals, and his curiosity, agricultural and veterinary science seems more aligned with his interests. Business administration does not align as closely with his described interests and personality traits.

Here are my estimates:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10
}

These values reflect my judgment that Adam's personality and interests align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.
