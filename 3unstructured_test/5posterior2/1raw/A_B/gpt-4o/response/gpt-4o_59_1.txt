Given Adam's personality traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it is reasonable to estimate that he is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. The traits seem to align well with a field centered around nature and animals.

On the other hand, while high intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts can be applicable to many fields, including business administration, the specific interests and empathy for animals and nature make this less likely. Hence, a lower probability is assigned to business administration.
