Based on Adam's personality sketch, it's highly probable that he would be drawn to a field that aligns with his interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy. Agricultural and veterinary science strongly fits this description. His appreciation for hard work and dedication, combined with high intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts, would also be valuable in this field.

On the other hand, business administration seems less likely considering Adam's interests and personality traits described. While his intelligence and problem-solving skills could be useful in business, his profound love for nature and animals doesn't align well with a typical business administration focus. Hence, the probability is lower for this field.
