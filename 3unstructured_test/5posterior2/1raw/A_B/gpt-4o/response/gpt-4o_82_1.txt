Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems more likely that he would pursue a field related to agricultural and veterinary science due to his genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. Business administration seems less aligned with these traits but isn't completely implausible, so a lower probability is assigned to that field.
