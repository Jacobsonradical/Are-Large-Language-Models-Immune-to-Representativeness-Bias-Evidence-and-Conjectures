My estimations are based on the alignment between Adam's personality traits and the nature of each field. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work suggest a strong fit with agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, these traits are less aligned with business administration, making it a less likely choice for him.
