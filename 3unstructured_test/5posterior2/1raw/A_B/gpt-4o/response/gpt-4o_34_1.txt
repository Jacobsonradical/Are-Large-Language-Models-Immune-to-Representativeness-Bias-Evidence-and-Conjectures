Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make some posterior estimates for the probability that he was enrolled in each field.

Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it seems more likely that Adam would be involved in a field closely related to his interests and personality traits. 

Therefore:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}

These probabilities are based on the provided personality traits heavily aligning with agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration. Business administration does not necessarily align with Adam's love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles as strongly.
