Explanation:
Given Adam's personality sketch – his curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work – it is more likely that he would be drawn to a field that aligns with these traits. Agricultural and veterinary science fits well with his interests in nature, plants, and animals. While business administration is a possibility, it does not seem to directly align with his described characteristics and passions.
