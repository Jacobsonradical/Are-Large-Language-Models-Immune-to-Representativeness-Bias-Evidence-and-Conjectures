Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it's reasonable to infer a high probability of him being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His interests and traits align closely with this field. On the other hand, business administration doesn't seem to match his personality sketch as closely, hence the much lower probability.
