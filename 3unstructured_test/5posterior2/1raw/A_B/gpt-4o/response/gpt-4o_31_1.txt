Based on Adam's personality traits and interests, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in a field closely related to his love of nature, plants, and animals, rather than in business administration. His intelligence, empathy, and strong appreciation for hard work could make him suitable for various scientific or caregiving fields, but his specific interests guide us towards agricultural and veterinary science.

Here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
