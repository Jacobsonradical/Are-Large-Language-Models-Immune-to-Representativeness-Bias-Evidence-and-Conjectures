Given Adam's personality sketch and the provided context, it is reasonable to infer that he would be more inclined towards fields that align with his love for animals, nature, and abstract problem-solving. Here are the estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These values reflect the higher likelihood that Adam would be enrolled in fields associated with his interest in nature, plants, animals, and abstract reasoning over a field like business administration which typically focuses on management, finance, and operations.
