Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make some estimates of the posterior conditional probabilities for the two specified fields. 

Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy align well with the characteristics of students who pursue agricultural and veterinary sciences. His intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be applicable in various fields, but they don't align as strongly with business administration, given that the sketch emphasizes his quieter, empathy-driven nature and affection for animals and nature over business-related traits.

Here are the estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
