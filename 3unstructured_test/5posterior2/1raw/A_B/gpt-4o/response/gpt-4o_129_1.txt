Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, which highlights his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, here are my best estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These estimates reflect that Adam's interests and traits are more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science, given his love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles. His qualities do not strongly suggest business administration, which typically focuses on economic, managerial, and organizational concepts.
