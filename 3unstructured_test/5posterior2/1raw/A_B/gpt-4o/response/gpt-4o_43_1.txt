Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, I can estimate the probabilities for the given fields as follows:

1. Agricultural and veterinary science: Adam shows a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an understanding of hard work and dedication. These traits align well with someone studying agricultural or veterinary science. Therefore, the probability would be relatively high.

2. Business administration: While Adam is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, the rest of his traits (such as a love for nature, plants, and animals) do not strongly align with the typical profile of someone in business administration. Therefore, the probability for this field would be relatively low.

Here's the estimation in the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
