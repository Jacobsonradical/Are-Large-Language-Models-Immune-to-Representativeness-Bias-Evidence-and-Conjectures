Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, it's quite likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Moreover, his intelligence and understanding of hard work align well with the demands of this field.

In contrast, business administration seems less likely based on his personality traits. While his intelligence and appreciation for hard work could be useful in business fields, there is no specific mention of interest in business-oriented activities, making it a less probable choice.
