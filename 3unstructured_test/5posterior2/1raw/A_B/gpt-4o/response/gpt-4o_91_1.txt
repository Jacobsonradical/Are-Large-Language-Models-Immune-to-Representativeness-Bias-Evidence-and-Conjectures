Based on Adam's personality sketch, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for the two fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

The probability for agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high because Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals. Business administration has a lower probability since his personality traits and interests seem less aligned with this field.
