Given Adam's personality sketch, we would expect him to be more likely to pursue a field that aligns with his interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, rather than a field like business administration which typically doesn't align with those traits.

Here's my estimate for the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
```
