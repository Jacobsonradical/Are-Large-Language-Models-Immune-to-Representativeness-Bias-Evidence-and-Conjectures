Explanation: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, it seems highly probable that he might be inclined towards a field that aligns with these interests, such as agricultural and veterinary science. This field would allow him to work closely with animals and nature, which aligns well with his described personality traits.

On the other hand, business administration is less likely for Adam based on his personality sketch. Although his high intelligence and appreciation for hard work could be beneficial in a business context, the lack of specific interest in business-related activities makes it less probable that he would choose this field.
