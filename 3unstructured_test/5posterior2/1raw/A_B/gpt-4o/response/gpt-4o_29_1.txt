Given Adam's personality sketch, he has a strong empathy for animals, a deep curiosity about nature, and an appreciation for hard work, which aligns more closely with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. His empathy and love for animals are particularly strong indicators. While his intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could allow him to pursue a wide range of fields, his specific interests make it less likely that he would choose business administration. Therefore, the probability of him being in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively higher.
