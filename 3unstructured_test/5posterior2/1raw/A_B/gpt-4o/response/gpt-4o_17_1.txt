Explanation:
Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align well with fields such as agricultural and veterinary science. These traits are less commonly associated with business administration, which typically emphasizes skills like leadership, financial acumen, and strategic planning over empathy and a love for animals. While it is still possible for someone with Adam's traits to be in business administration, it seems significantly more likely that he would choose a field closely related to his interests and personality, such as agricultural and veterinary science.
