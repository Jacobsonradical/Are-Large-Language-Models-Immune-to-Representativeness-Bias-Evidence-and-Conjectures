Given Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and empathy, it is more likely that he may be enrolled in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration. However, it is still possible (although less likely) that he could be studying business administration or another field, hence the value of 0.1 for that field.
