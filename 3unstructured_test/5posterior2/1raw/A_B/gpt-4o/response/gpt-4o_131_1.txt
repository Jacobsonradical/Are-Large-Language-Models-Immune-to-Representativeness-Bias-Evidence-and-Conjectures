### Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.75):** Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his deep love for animals, aligns strongly with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His warm heart and empathy further support the likelihood of him choosing a field that involves caring for animals and understanding natural ecosystems.
- **Business Administration (0.05):** While Adam's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be valuable in business administration, his personality traits—such as a quiet demeanor, warm heart, empathy, and love for animals—are less directly connected to the typical characteristics and interests that drive people into business fields. Therefore, this field is assigned a much lower probability.
