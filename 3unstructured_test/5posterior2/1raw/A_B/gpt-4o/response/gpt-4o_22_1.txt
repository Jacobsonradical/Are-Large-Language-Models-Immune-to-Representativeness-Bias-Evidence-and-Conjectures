Based on Adam's personality sketch, the field with the highest posterior conditional probability would seem to be agricultural and veterinary science, given his curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals. Business administration seems less likely, given there are no indications in his personality sketch that align well with typical interests or qualities in that field.

Here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
