Given Adam's personality sketch, where he shows a strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, it is more plausible to infer that he would be enrolled in a field like agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration. His love for solving puzzles and high intelligence suggest more in-depth academic pursuits aligned with the natural sciences.
