Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make educated guesses about the likelihood of his involvement in specific graduate fields. The key details to consider are his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work.

Given these traits, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,  # Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals makes this field a strong match.
  "business administration": 0.1  # This field does not directly align with Adam's interests in nature, empathy, and abstract concepts.
}

These probabilities reflect the alignment of his personality traits with the typical interests and demands of these fields.
