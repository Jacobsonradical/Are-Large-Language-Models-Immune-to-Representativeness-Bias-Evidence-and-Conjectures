Given Adam's personality sketch, the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for each field of study are:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, coupled with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, makes him more likely to be drawn to a field such as agricultural and veterinary science than to business administration.
