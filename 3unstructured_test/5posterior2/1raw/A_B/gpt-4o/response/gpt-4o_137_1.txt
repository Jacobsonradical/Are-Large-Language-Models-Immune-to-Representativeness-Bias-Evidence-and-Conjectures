Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make educated guesses about the likelihood that he was enrolled in each field. His curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work point strongly towards fields related to agricultural and veterinary sciences. His preference for solving puzzles and abstract thinking may also be relevant in various fields but are less directly related to business administration considering his demonstrated interests and traits.

Let's estimate the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Here, the probability is higher for agricultural and veterinary science due to the alignment of his characteristics with the demands and nature of that field. The probability is notably lower for business administration as his personal traits and interests do not strongly correlate with those typically necessary for that field.
