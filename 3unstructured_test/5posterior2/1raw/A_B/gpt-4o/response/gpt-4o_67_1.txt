Here is my estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

### Rationale:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.75)**:
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants aligns well with agricultural science.
   - His love for animals fits perfectly with veterinary science.
   - His high intelligence and capacity for understanding abstract concepts support the advanced studies necessary in these fields.
   - His appreciation for hard work and dedication is essential for both agriculture and veterinary science, which demand significant hands-on effort and perseverance.

2. **Business Administration (0.1)**:
   - There is little in the personality sketch that suggests a specific interest in business or management.
   - Adamâ€™s traits such as empathy, curiosity about nature, and a love for animals are not typically associated with business administration, which often focuses on organizational, financial, and managerial skills.
   - Although his intelligence and problem-solving skills are assets in any field, they do not specifically point towards a strong inclination for business administration related areas.

By considering Adam's interests, traits, and alignment with the characteristics and demands of these fields, it is more probable that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.
