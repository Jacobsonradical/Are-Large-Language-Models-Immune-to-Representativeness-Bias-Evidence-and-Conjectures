Given Adam's personality sketch, the probability that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science seems significantly higher than that of business administration. Here are my best estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
```

These estimations are based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals as well as his empathy and intelligence, which align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration.
