To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider the features of his personality and how well they align with each field. Specifically, let's consider the following points for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Strongly correlated with this field.
- Love for animals: Strongly correlated with this field.
- Warm heart and strong empathy: Slightly correlated, as these traits could be beneficial in veterinary practice.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant, but not exclusive to this field.

### Computer Science
- Enjoying solving puzzles: Strongly correlated.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Highly relevant, as these skills are crucial in computer science.
- Quiet nature: Neutral; doesn't heavily sway the probability.

Using these correlations, we qualitatively assess the likelihood of Adam being in each field. Given his strong connections with nature, plants, and animals, agricultural and veterinary science seems more aligned with his interests. However, his intelligence and liking for puzzles could suggest a leaning towards computer science as well.

This qualitative analysis can be supplemented by applying Bayes' Theorem, but without specific prior probabilities or statistical data, our answers will remain somewhat subjective but reasoned.

Let's assign the probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

I've assigned a higher probability to agricultural and veterinary science especially because of the strong affinity with nature, plants, and animals, and a significant but lower probability to computer science due to his liking for puzzles and abstract thinking.
