To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we use Bayesian reasoning by considering how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with the typical characteristics and interests of students in each field. However, without explicit base rates, we need to rely on qualitative reasoning.

- **Computer Science:** While the high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators, the empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not strongly align.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and strong empathy fit much more closely with this field.

Given these qualitative observations, let's compute rough probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These values suggest that Adam's personality sketch is more representative of someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than Computer Science, though it does not completely rule out the possibility of him being in other fields.
