To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam's enrollment in the given fields based on his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian inference. Specifically, we need to consider how well Adam's interests and traits match those typically associated with each field of study.

While exact figures require detailed statistical data about enrollment probabilities and personality characteristic distributions, we can reasonably estimate based on the provided personality sketch.

Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, he seems to fit well with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might also make him a good candidate for computer science, but it's less directly aligned with his interests in nature and animals.

Based on this qualitative analysis, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values reflect a higher probability that Adam's personality aligns with agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. This estimation leaves room for other fields that may also align with his personality traits but were not explicitly listed.
