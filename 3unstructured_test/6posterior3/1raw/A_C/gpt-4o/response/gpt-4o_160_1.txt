To determine the posterior conditional probabilities, we would rely on Bayesian probability. This involves considering how well Adam's personality traits match typical characteristics of students in each field.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

We need to assess how these traits align with typical profiles in computer science and agricultural and veterinary science. 

For **computer science**:
- Curiosity and solving puzzles are strong indicators.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are crucial.

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
- Curiosity about nature and plants.
- Warm heart, empathy, and love for animals align neatly.
- The appreciation for hard work fits well with the field's demands.

Given these considerations, the probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This estimate reflects that Adam's traits seem more strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science but are still significant for computer science.
