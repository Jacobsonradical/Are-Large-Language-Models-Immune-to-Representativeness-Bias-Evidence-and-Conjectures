Here is the computed posterior conditional probability for each field based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

The reasoning for these probabilities is as follows:

- Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science.
- His skills in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could apply to computer science, but his personality sketch doesn't emphasize technology or computing, which makes it less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
