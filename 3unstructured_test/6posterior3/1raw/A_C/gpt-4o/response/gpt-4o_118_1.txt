Based on Adam's personality sketch:

- A genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

Given this information, let's compute the posterior conditional probabilities:

For **computer science**:
- Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators for computer science.
- However, there is no specific mention of an interest in technology, programming, or computers.
  
For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
- A genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as a love for animals, are strong indicators for agricultural and veterinary science.
- Strong empathy and appreciation for hard work also align well with this field.

Given these observations:
