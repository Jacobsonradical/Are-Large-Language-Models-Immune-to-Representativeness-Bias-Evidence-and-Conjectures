To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning. We will consider how well his traits match common stereotypes or requirements in each field.

Let's consider these elements in Adam's personality sketch:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Interest in animals and a deep love for them.
3. Quiet demeanor and interest in solving puzzles.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Warm heart and strong empathy.

For "computer science":
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators for excelling in computer science.
- Interest in solving puzzles also aligns well with computer science.
- However, there is less mention of an overlap with natural curiosity about nature/plants and love for animals.

For "agricultural and veterinary science":
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants aligns strongly with agricultural science.
- Deep love for animals is a significant indicator for veterinary science.
- Warm heart, empathy, and understanding hard work also align well with agricultural and veterinary fields.

Based on these observations, we can assign probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Note that while Adam's intellectual traits could fit him into multiple fields, his specific noted interests in nature, plants, and animals over index towards agricultural and veterinary science. The remaining probability (0.1) is not explicitly assigned but would cover other potential fields.
