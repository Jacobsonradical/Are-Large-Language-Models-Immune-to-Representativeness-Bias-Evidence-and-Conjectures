To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in a specific graduate field given his personality traits, we need to use Bayesian inference. However, we do not have specific prior probabilities or likelihoods, but we can qualitatively assess the fit of his personality traits to each field.

### Assessment:
- **Computer Science:**
  - Traits like high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles align well with this field.
  - However, other traits like a warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals are not strongly indicative of computer science.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - Traits like a genuine curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work and dedication, and a deep love for animals strongly align with this field.
  - His warm heart and strong empathy also align well with the nurturing aspect of veterinary science.

Based on this qualitative assessment, the fit is stronger for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.

### Posterior Conditional Probability Estimate:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are approximate and reflect the qualitative fit based on the provided personality sketch.
