To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to consider which aspects of his personality align more closely with each field. 

Given:
1. **Computer Science:** 
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles.
   - He has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
   - He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Based on these attributes, we can estimate the likelihood as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science Probability (0.3):** While Adam's knack for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are relevant to computer science, the other aspects of his personality (like empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature) aren't strongly aligned with this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science Probability (0.7):** The majority of Adam's personality traits—such as his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work—fit well within this field, making it a more likely choice for him.
