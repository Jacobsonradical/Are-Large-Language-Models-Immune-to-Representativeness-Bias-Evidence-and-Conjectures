To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. However, due to the lack of specific priors and the likelihood ratios, we can only make qualitative judgments based on the provided personality traits.

Adam's personality traits include curiosity about nature, a love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work. These traits seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than with computer science. 

Based on this qualitative assessment, here are the approximate probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect that Adam is more likely to be studying something directly related to his interests in nature and animals than computer science, given his personality sketch. These probabilities are not absolute and serve as an approximate indication based on the provided information.
