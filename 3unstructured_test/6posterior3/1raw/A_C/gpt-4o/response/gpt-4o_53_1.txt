To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can make use of Bayes' theorem. However, without specific base rates or detailed statistical data, we will rely on a heuristic approach considering Adam's personality traits and their relevance to each field.

Given Adam's characteristics:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Love for animals
- Empathy and warm-hearted nature
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

We can infer the likelihood of Adam fitting in each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Curiosity about nature and plants aligns well with this field.
   - Love for animals is also a strong indicator that he might be inclined towards veterinary science.
   - Empathy and dedication are valuable traits in agriculture and veterinary work.

2. **Computer Science**: 
   - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are highly relevant.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns with problem-solving in computer science.

Given these inferences:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These probabilities reflect the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the typical demands and environments of each field, skewing more heavily towards agricultural and veterinary science due to his specific interests in nature and animals.
