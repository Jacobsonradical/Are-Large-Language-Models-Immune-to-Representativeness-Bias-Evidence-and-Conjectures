Given Adam's personality sketch, we can use subjective reasoning to estimate the posterior probabilities that he was enrolled in the specified fields. The probabilities are not derived from statistical data but are informed by his interests and traits as described:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He has a deep love for animals.
- He is good at understanding abstract concepts, indicating high intelligence.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Given these details, it seems that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science due to his interest in nature and animals. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also make him suitable for computer science.

{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}

This is a rough subjective estimation. If empirical data were available, a more precise calculation could be made.
