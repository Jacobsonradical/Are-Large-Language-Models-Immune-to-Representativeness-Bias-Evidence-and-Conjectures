To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, agricultural and veterinary science or computer science, given his personality sketch, we need to take into account how well his characteristics align with typical profiles in each field. This involves a degree of subjective judgment and an understanding of the common traits associated with students in these fields.

Here's an estimation based on Adam's personality sketch:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - Deep love for animals.
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work.

2. Computer Science:
   - High intelligence.
   - Good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles.

Given this, we might reason as follows:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals aligns strongly with this field. Additionally, his empathy and appreciation for hard work are valuable traits in a field that involves working closely with living beings and often under challenging conditions.

- **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence and skill in abstract reasoning and puzzle-solving are especially well-suited for computer science. However, the emphasis on empathy, a deep love for animals, and nature is less directly applicable to this field, though not entirely irrelevant.

Based on these considerations, here's a rough estimation of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These probabilities reflect that, while Adam's traits could fit both fields, they are more closely aligned with agricultural and veterinary science due to his strong affinity for nature and animals. However, his intelligence and problem-solving skills also make computer science a plausible field of study.
