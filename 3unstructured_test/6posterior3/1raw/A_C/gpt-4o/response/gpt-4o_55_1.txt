To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in specific fields given his personality sketch, we need to use the principles of Bayesian inference. For this purpose, let's denote:

- \( A \): Adam's personality sketch.
- \( F_{\text{ag}} \): Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( F_{\text{cs}} \): Adam is enrolled in computer science.

We are looking for \( P(F_{\text{ag}}|A) \) and \( P(F_{\text{cs}}|A) \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(F_{\text{ag}}|A) = \frac{P(A|F_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(F_{\text{ag}})}{P(A)} \]
\[ P(F_{\text{cs}}|A) = \frac{P(A|F_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(F_{\text{cs}})}{P(A)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|F_{\text{ag}}) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(A|F_{\text{cs}}) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science.
- \( P(F_{\text{ag}}) \) is the prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(F_{\text{cs}}) \) is the prior probability that a random graduate student is in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch (normalizing constant).

Since \( P(A) \) is the same for both posterior probabilities, we can ignore it for comparison purposes. We need to estimate the other terms based on the information we have.

**Prior Probabilities**:
Here we consider general statistics about graduate field enrollment rates:
- Agricultural and veterinary sciences tend to have a lower enrollment rate compared to computer science.
- Let's assume \( P(F_{\text{ag}}) = 0.05 \) (5%) and \( P(F_{\text{cs}}) = 0.15 \) (15%).

**Likelihoods**:
Based on Adam's personality:
- Curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work: Strongly suggest agricultural and veterinary science.
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles: Align well with computer science.

We can reasonably assign likelihood estimates:
- \( P(A|F_{\text{ag}}) = 0.7 \) (70%)
- \( P(A|F_{\text{cs}}) = 0.6 \) (60%)

Plugging these numbers into Bayes' theorem (excluding \( P(A) \) for simplicity):

\[ P(F_{\text{ag}}|A) \propto P(A|F_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(F_{\text{ag}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]
\[ P(F_{\text{cs}}|A) \propto P(A|F_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(F_{\text{cs}}) = 0.6 \cdot 0.15 = 0.09 \]

To convert these to proper probabilities, we need to normalize so they sum to 1, but in this context, they provide an approximation.

Final answer in desired format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.035,
  "computer science": 0.09
}
```

These values indicate that, given Adam's personality, it is more likely he was in computer science than in agricultural and veterinary science, but both probabilities are non-negligible given his attributes.
