In the absence of specific numerical data or likelihoods, estimating the posterior conditional probabilities in question requires a subjective judgement based on the given personality traits and background information.

Let's denote:
- The probability Adam is in computer science as \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Adam's traits}) \)
- The probability Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science as \( P(\text{AVS} | \text{Adam's traits}) \)

For computer science, the relevant traits include high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles. While these traits are common among computer science students, thereâ€™s nothing directly tying Adam to computer science based on his described interests.

For agricultural and veterinary science, Adam's curiosity about nature, various plants, and his deep love for animals are strong indicators that align well with this field. His empathy and warm heart are also suitable for a field that involves working with living organisms and perhaps caring for animals.

With these considerations, we can subjectively assess:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect that while Adam's traits could qualify him for computer science, his strong connection to nature, plants, and animals makes agricultural and veterinary science a more likely field of study.
