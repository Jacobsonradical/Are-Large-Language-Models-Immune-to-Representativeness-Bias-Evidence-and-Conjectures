To compute the posterior conditional probabilities of Adam being enrolled in either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "computer science," we can use Bayesian inference. We need to consider how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with each field.

Given:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a deep love for animals, a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and an appreciation for hard work. These traits align well with this field.
- **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with an ability to understand abstract concepts. However, there is little in the sketch about technology or computing interests.

We can also consider the relative proportion of students in these fields, but since we do not have exact figures, we will focus more on qualitative alignment with the field.

Using these assessments, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's personality traits are a strong fit for agricultural and veterinary science but also indicate some potential (albeit less pronounced) affinity for computer science due to his problem-solving skills and intellect.
