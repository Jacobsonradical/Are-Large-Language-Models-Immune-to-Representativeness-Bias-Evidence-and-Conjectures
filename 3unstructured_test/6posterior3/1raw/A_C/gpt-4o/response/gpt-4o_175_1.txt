To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality traits align with the typical characteristics and interests of individuals in the given fields. While we do not have exact data to perform a formal Bayesian analysis, we can make a reasoned approximation based on indicative traits.

Given Adam's personality sketch:

- Strong empathy and a deep love for animals are significant markers for agricultural and veterinary science.
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts can be aligned with both fields but are particularly crucial in computer science.
- Curiosity about nature and plants directly points more towards agricultural and veterinary science.

Using qualitative reasoning, let's provide an estimated posterior conditional probability:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect that while Adam has traits that can fit both fields, his love for animals and nature, as well as empathy, strongly suggest a better fit for agricultural and veterinary science.
