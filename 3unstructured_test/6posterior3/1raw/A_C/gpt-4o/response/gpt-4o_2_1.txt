To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we would typically need to use Bayes' theorem. The application of Bayesâ€™ theorem requires prior probabilities for each field and likelihood values based on Adam's characteristics. These probabilities are not provided, so I will use qualitative reasoning to estimate them based on the given personality sketch.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

### Explanation:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants strongly aligns with this field.
   - His love for animals directly correlates with veterinary science.
   - His appreciation for hard work and dedication is essential in agricultural studies, where practical application and fieldwork are common.

2. **Computer Science (0.3):**
   - Adam's high intelligence, skill in understanding abstract concepts, and affinity for solving puzzles fit well with computer science.
   - However, there is less direct evidence in his personality sketch indicating a strong interest specifically in computer science compared to the more apparent fit with agricultural and veterinary science.

These estimates are subjective and assume equal prior probabilities for all graduate fields before updating with the new information provided by Adam's personality sketch. In a more rigorous analysis, actual data about the distribution of interests or students in these fields would refine these probabilities.
