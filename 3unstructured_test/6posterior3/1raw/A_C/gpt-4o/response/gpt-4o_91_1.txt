To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science given his personality sketch, we must analyze how well Adam's characteristics fit typical profiles for graduate students in these fields.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Strong empathy and love for animals.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

**Computer Science:**
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles.

Given Adam's profile, he seems to align more strongly with characteristics associated with both fields but more so with agricultural and veterinary science due to his empathy, love for animals, and nature-focused curiosity.

Based on this analysis:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This suggests that, given the personality sketch, it's more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, though there is still a reasonable probability that he could be in either field.
