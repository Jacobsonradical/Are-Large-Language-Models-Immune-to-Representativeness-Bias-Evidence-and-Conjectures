To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or computer science, given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. For simplicity and lack of specific base rates, we'll make some educated assumptions based on typical personality fit for each field. These assumptions will help us estimate the posterior probabilities.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
   - These traits strongly align with a career in agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles.
   - He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - While these traits align with computer science, the lack of specific mention of a strong interest in technology or computing per se makes it somewhat less certain.

Given this reasoning, the posterior probabilities might be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect that while Adam's traits align well with both fields, the alignment is stronger with agricultural and veterinary science based on the given personality sketch.
