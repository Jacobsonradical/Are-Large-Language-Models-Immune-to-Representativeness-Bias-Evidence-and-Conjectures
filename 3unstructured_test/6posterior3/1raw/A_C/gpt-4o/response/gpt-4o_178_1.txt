To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science, we can use Bayesian reasoning. This involves considering prior probabilities and how well Adam's traits match with each field. 

Given Adam's personality sketch:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Strongly indicates an interest in agricultural and veterinary science.
- Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles: Could fit either field, as computer science involves problem-solving and abstract concepts, while agricultural science could involve intricate biological puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals: Strongly indicates agricultural and veterinary science.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Fits well with computer science.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Could fit either field, as both require these qualities.

Given these, we can make reasoned estimates about the conditional probabilities.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3, 
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are estimations, indicating that based on the personality sketch, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, but there is still a notable chance he was enrolled in computer science. These are subjective probabilities rather than precise calculations because we don't have exact prior distributions for Adam's enrollment in these fields.
