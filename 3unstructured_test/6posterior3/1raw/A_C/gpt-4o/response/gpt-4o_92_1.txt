To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science given his personality sketch, let's consider the alignment of his personality traits and interests with the typical expectations and characteristics of those fields.

Given Information:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants.
   - Warm heart, empathy, and love for animals.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

2. **Computer science**:
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles.

Here's how we can deduce the probabilities:

- Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align very well with **agricultural and veterinary science**.
- Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with **computer science**, though these traits can also be applicable to many fields.

However, his personality sketch contains more direct elements that align with **agricultural and veterinary science** due to his affinity for nature and animals, which makes it slightly more likely that he would be in this field.

Taking these considerations into account, here are the computed posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This estimate suggests that it is more likely for Adam to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his strong interest in nature and animals, though there is still a significant probability that he could be in computer science due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills.
