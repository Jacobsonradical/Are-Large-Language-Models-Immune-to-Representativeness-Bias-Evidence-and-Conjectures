To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science, we need to take into account how his personality sketch aligns with each field. This involves assessing the likelihood of someone with Adam’s characteristics being in each of these fields.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, these traits seem more in line with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and skill in solving puzzles can be relevant for computer science, but his deep appreciation for nature and animals leans heavily towards the agricultural and veterinary field.

It’s important to note that this is probabilistic reasoning, and exact numerical probabilities would ideally be derived from empirical data which we don’t have. Thus, these are subjective estimates based on the provided qualitative information.

Here's an estimated posterior probability based on the personality sketch:
