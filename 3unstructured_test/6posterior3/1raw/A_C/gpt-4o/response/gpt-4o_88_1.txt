To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in a specific field (agricultural and veterinary science or computer science) given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, without concrete prior probabilities and likelihoods, it is challenging to calculate exact numerical values.

Nevertheless, based on the personality sketch provided, we can make qualitative assessments of the probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align very well with a field that involves working closely with nature and animals.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam is highly intelligent, enjoys solving puzzles, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits are favorable for a computer science field. However, there is no specific mention of any particular interest or activity in technology, programming, or computers.

Considering these factors, here is an educated guess for the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

Again, the exact probabilities would require more detailed prior knowledge and quantitative likelihoods, but these qualitative estimates suggest a stronger alignment with agricultural and veterinary science based on Adam's personality traits.
