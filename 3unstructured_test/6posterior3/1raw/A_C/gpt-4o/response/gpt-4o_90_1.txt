To deduce the posterior conditional probabilities, we'll rely on Bayesian reasoning, utilizing Adam's personality traits and interests as evidence to weigh the likelihood of his enrollment in each given field. Here's how we'll approach this:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, strong empathy, and a warm heart. These traits align well with the focus of agricultural and veterinary sciences, which involve caring for animals and understanding plant biology.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and understands abstract concepts well. These are traits that align with success in computer science, which requires logical problem-solving skills and the ability to work with complex, abstract problems.

Given this relatively qualitative data, we'll use these heuristic observations to estimate the posterior probabilities.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "computer science": 0.50
}
```

This estimation suggests that Adam has a higher probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science due to his love for animals, plants, and empathy, though he also has a substantial probability for computer science due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills.
