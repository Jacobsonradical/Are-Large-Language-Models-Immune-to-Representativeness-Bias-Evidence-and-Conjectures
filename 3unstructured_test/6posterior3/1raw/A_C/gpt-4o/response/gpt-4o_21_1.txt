To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

However, without specific values for the prior probabilities (\( P(A) \)) and likelihoods (\( P(B | A) \)), we must base our estimates on the provided information and general knowledge about the fields.

Given Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals
- Tendency to enjoy solving puzzles
- High intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's analyze each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Curiosity about nature and plants aligns well with agricultural science.
   - Love for animals aligns strongly with veterinary science.
   - Strong empathy and warm heart are important for both fields, especially veterinary science.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication is crucial in both fields due to the physical and emotional demands.
   - Given these traits, Adam seems highly suitable for agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Solving puzzles aligns with problem-solving in computer science.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are important for computer science.
   - However, curiosity about nature and love for animals are less directly related.
   - Empathy and warm heart are valuable but not central to computer science.
   - Hard work and dedication are important in any field, including computer science.

Given this qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These estimates suggest Adam is quite likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the alignment of his personality traits with those fields, whereas he has a moderate likelihood of being in computer science due to his intelligence and love for puzzles, but less alignment with his other traits.
