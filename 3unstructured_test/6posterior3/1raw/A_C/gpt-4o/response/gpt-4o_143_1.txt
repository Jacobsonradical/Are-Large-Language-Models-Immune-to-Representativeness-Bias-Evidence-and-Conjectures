To compute the posterior probability of Adam's enrollment in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science, we need to consider how his personality aligns with the common traits, interests, and skills associated with those fields. This is done by using Bayesian inference, where \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( A \) given data \( B \). 

Given the personality traits described, we need \( P(Field | Personality) \) for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Traits matching:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Deep love for animals
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Appreciation for hard work

Given these traits, it is quite likely Adam might be involved in this field. Thus, a high posterior probability can be assigned.

### Computer Science
Traits matching:
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- High intelligence
- Good at understanding abstract concepts

While these traits definitely align with those common in the field of computer science, the absence of any specific interest in technology or programming in his personality sketch suggests a moderate posterior probability, but not as high as for agricultural and veterinary science.

Taking this into account, here is the computed posterior conditional probability:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "computer science": 0.60
}
