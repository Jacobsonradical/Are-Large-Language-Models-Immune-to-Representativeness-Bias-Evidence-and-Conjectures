To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality traits map to the typical fields of study. Given that this is not a Bayesian calculation involving prior probabilities but rather an assessment based on traits, we can make reasoned estimates.

Here's the analysis:

- **Computer Science**: Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, both of which are beneficial traits for computer science. However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work and dedication do not particularly align with what one would generally associate with a career in computer science (though they do not disqualify it either).

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, deep love for animals, and strong empathy align very well with agricultural and veterinary science fields. His intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts also support the scientific aspects of this field. 

Considering these points, here’s the resulting conditional probability estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the stronger alignment of Adam's personality traits with the field of agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
