To compute the posterior probabilities for Adam's enrollment in specified graduate fields given his personality sketch, we must consider how closely his traits align with typical characteristics and interests of students in these fields.

Given:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - Deep love for animals.
   - Strong empathy.
   - Warm heart.

By examining these characteristics and interests, we would expect Adam's personality to correlate more closely with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Using a Bayesian approach, and considering the qualitative nature of the given data (without exact priors), we can make an educated estimate of the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Here, the value for Computer Science is lower because, although Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is highly intelligent, many of his strongest traits—such as empathy and a love for nature and animals—are more aligned with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
