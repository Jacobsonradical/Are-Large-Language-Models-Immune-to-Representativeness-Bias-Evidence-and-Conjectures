To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, let's consider Adam's personality traits and how they match with the fields of computer science and agricultural/veterinary science. 

Given:
- Adam's curiosity about nature and plants.
- Adam's love for animals.
- Adam's warmth and empathy.
- Adam's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Now, let's proceed with the evaluation:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science, which often requires strong analytical skills and problem-solving abilities.
   - However, Adam’s love for nature, animals, and empathy might not align as closely with the typical activities in computer science, which are often more technically oriented and less focused on nature or animals.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam’s curiosity about nature and its various plants aligns strongly with agricultural science.
   - His deep love for animals fits well with veterinary science.
   - His warm heart and empathy are also a good match for this field as it often involves caring for animals and working closely with natural environments.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication matches well with the demanding nature of agricultural and veterinary fields.

Given these considerations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These probabilities are subjective estimates based on how closely Adam's personality traits align with the general characteristics and demands of each field. The posterior probabilities reflect a more significant alignment with agricultural and veterinary science due to his love for nature and animals, while still leaving a notable probability for computer science due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills.
