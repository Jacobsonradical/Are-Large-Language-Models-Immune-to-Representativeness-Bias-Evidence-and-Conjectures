To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, consider the alignment between Adam's personality and both fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
   - Deep love for animals
   - Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication
   - High empathy

His personality traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science. 

2. **Computer Science**
   - Enjoys solving puzzles
   - High intelligence
   - Good at understanding abstract concepts

While some traits fit computer science, such as puzzle-solving skills and abstract thinking, the overall alignment with empathy, love for animals, and nature suggests a stronger pull towards agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on this reasoning:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These probabilities reflect the stronger alignment of his interests and personality with agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
