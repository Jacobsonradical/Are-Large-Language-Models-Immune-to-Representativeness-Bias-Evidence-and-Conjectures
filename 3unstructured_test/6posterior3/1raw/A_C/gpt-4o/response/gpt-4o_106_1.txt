To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field (A) given his personality sketch (B).

1. **P(B|A)**: Probability of the personality sketch given the field.
2. **P(A)**: Prior probability of being enrolled in the field.
3. **P(B)**: Probability of the personality sketch.

While it's complex to provide exact numerical values without empirical data, we can make reasonable qualitative assumptions based on the given personality sketch and general trends in these fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- **P(B|A)**: High. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align well with this field.
- **P(A)**: Let's assume a moderate prior probability compared to other fields since agricultural programs are less common than, say, business or engineering.
- Based on his interests and traits, this field appears to be a good fit.

### Computer Science:

- **P(B|A)**: Moderate. His love for solving puzzles and high intelligence are strong indicators, but the deep love for animals and nature is less directly related.
- **P(A)**: High. Computer science programs are very common, and many students are enrolled in these programs, making the prior probability relatively high.
- This is a plausible field but less directly connected to some of his personality traits.

Using these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values are based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the characteristics typically associated with success and interest in these fields, keeping in mind the general popularity and enrollment trends for such programs.
