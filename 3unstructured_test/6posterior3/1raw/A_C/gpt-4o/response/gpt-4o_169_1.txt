To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science given his personality sketch, we would typically use Bayes' Theorem. However, in this context, we lack specific data to execute a precise calculation, such as base rates and likelihood values for each field given Adam's traits.

Still, we can make an educated approximation based on the information provided:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, which are highly relevant traits for this field. This alignment suggests a higher probability.

2. **Computer science:** Adam's traits include high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, enjoying solving puzzles, and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. While these are important in computer science, they are not as directly tied to his love for nature and animals.

Taking these alignments into account qualitatively:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Here, 0.7 (or 70%) implies a substantial connection between Adam's personality and agricultural and veterinary science, whereas 0.4 (or 40%) captures his aptitude and traits beneficial for computer science but less aligned with his evident passion for nature and animals. Keep in mind that these values are approximate and based on reasoned conjecture, not precise probabilities from empirical data.
