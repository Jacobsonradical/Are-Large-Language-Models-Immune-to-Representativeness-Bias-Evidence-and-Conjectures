To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality traits. While we don't have precise data or priors, we can make a qualitative estimation based on the personality sketch provided.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it seems more likely that he might be drawn to fields related to the natural world and animal care.

Here is the probabilistic assessment:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are estimations that reflect the higher probability that his characteristics align better with agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
