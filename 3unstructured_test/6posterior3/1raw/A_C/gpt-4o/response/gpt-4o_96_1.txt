To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we rely on Bayesian principles. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence. We need to calculate how likely Adam is to be in each field given his personality sketch.

### Assumptions
To arrive at a rough estimate, we will make a few heuristic assumptions:
1. The traits described are equally relevant and informative across different fields.
2. The base rates (prior probabilities) of students in different fields are not considered here since the problem does not provide that data.

### Traits Analysis
- **Computer Science**: Relevant traits include high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Relevant traits include curiosity about nature and its plants, love for animals, empathy, appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Heuristic Weights
We will use a qualitative assessment to determine how strongly each of Adam's traits matches the typical characteristics of students in each field:

- **Computer Science**:
  - High intelligence: High relevance.
  - Abstract concepts: High relevance.
  - Solving puzzles: High relevance.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - Curiosity about nature: High relevance.
  - Love for animals: High relevance.
  - Empathy: High relevance.
  - Hard work: Moderate relevance.

Adam's descriptions seem to map strongly to Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to specific mentions of nature, plants, and animals. Computer Science fits his analytical skills but lacks as many direct correlations to his interests.

### Estimated Posterior Conditional Probabilities
Based on this heuristic assessment:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are rough estimates based on the personality traits provided. The exact posterior probabilities would require more detailed information, including the base rates and a more rigorous statistical analysis.
