Based on the provided personality sketch and known background of Adam, we need to estimate the probability of him being enrolled in two specific fields of graduate study. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, these attributes align strongly with agricultural and veterinary sciences. Comparatively, Adam's intelligence and aptitude for solving abstract problems might link him to computer science, although his noted interests suggest a stronger connection with agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, I would approximate the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
