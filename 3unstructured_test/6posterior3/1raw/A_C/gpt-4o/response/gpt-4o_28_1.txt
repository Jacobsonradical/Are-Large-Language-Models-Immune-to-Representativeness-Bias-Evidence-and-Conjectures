To compute the posterior probabilities, I'll use Bayes' Theorem. The formula for Bayes' Theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Given Adam's personality sketch (B), we need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field (A) given his personality traits (B). 

We need to estimate:
1. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of Adam having the given personality traits if he is in a given field.
2. \( P(A) \): The prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
3. \( P(B) \): The overall probability of Adam having the given personality traits, which serves as a normalizing factor.

Since we don't have exact numerical data, we'll make reasonable qualitative assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch and the nature of the fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **\( P(B|A) \)**: High probability because his love for nature, plants, and animals aligns well with this field.
2. **\( P(A) \)**: Moderate probability since agricultural and veterinary science isn't the most common field but is reasonably well-represented.
3. **\( P(B) \)**: Assume constant for normalization purposes.

### Computer Science
1. **\( P(B|A) \)**: Moderate probability, Adam's abstract thinking and problem-solving align with computer science, but his empathy and love for animals are less directly relevant.
2. **\( P(A) \)**: High probability as computer science is a very popular graduate field.
3. **\( P(B) \)**: Assume constant for normalization purposes.

Based on these qualitative assessments:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values represent a reasoned guess considering his traits and the relevance to each field. The probabilities do not sum to 1 because other fields could also match his personality.
