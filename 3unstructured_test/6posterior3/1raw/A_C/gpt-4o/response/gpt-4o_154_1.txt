To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam being enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science given his personality sketch, we can apply Bayesian reasoning. However, for simplicity, we'll make a qualitative assessment based on Adam’s characteristics.

Adam’s personality sketch suggests several key characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Strong love for animals
- Strong empathy and warm-heartedness
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

This personality sketch strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science due to his interest in nature, plants, and animals. While the qualities of high intelligence, abstract reasoning, and enjoying puzzles could align with computer science, the marked inclination towards nature and animals is a more distinctive fit for agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on these qualitative factors:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values suggest that while there is a moderate probability that Adam could be enrolled in computer science, the likelihood is significantly higher for agricultural and veterinary science given his described personality traits.
