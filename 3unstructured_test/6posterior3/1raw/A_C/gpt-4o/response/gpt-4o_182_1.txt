Given Adam's personality sketch and the details provided, I will use Bayesian reasoning to estimate the posterior probabilities. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of event \( A \) given event \( B \),
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of event \( B \) given event \( A \),
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event \( A \),
- \( P(B) \) is the evidence or total probability of event \( B \).

To apply this for the given question, we need to consider Adam's characteristics and how likely they are to be observed in someone enrolled in each field.

Estimate for "computer science":
- Adam's interest in puzzles and high intelligence align well with this field.
- However, the strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals are less typical among computer science students.
- Prior probability for computer science as a field (based on general distribution of grad students) might be moderate to high, but the specific personality traits make it less likely compared to other fields.

Estimate for "agricultural and veterinary science":
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication, which align very well with this field.
- These personality traits are highly indicative of someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on these factors, the posterior probabilities could be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Please note that these are approximations based on the qualitative analysis of the given personality sketch in the context of the two fields.
