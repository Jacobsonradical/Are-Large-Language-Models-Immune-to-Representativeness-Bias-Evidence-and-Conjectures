To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we need to rely on Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(Field | Personality) = \frac{P(Personality | Field) \times P(Field)}{P(Personality)} \]

Where:
- \( P(Field | Personality) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in the field given his personality.
- \( P(Personality | Field) \) is the likelihood of Adam having that personality given he is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(Field) \) is the prior probability of a student being in that field.
- \( P(Personality) \) is the overall probability of the personality described.

Since we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we need to estimate them based on the qualitative description provided. We'll make subjective estimates based on the typical characteristics associated with each field.

**Personality Fit:**
1. **Computer Science:**
   - High intelligence: Strong fit (CS students often need high intelligence)
   - Understanding abstract concepts: Strong fit (important in CS)
   - Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: Strong fit (common trait in CS students)
   - Genuine curiosity about nature: Neutral (not strongly associated)
   - Deep love for animals: Neutral
   - Strong empathy and warm heart: Neutral (not specifically aligned)
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Strong fit

   PTSD Computer Science: Moderate to Strong

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - High intelligence: Strong fit 
   - Understanding abstract concepts: Strong fit 
   - Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: Neutral to Moderate fit 
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants: Strong fit (aligned with interest in nature)
   - Deep love for animals: Strong fit (directly aligned with veterinary aspects)
   - Strong empathy and warm heart: Strong fit (veterinary science often involves animal care)
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Strong fit (agriculture requires dedication)

   P(Personality | Agricultural and Veterinary Science): Strong

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can estimate the probabilities. Because we lack the exact priors, we will apply educated guesses:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values are interpretative based on the strong alignment of Adam's personality traits with the requirements and typical characteristics of each field. Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than computer science.
