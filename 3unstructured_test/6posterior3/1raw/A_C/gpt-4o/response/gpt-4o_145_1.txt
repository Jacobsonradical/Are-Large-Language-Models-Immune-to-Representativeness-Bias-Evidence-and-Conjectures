To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. We'll make an informed estimation based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and our general understanding of the characteristics and inclinations associated with the fields in question. Here's an outline of our reasoning:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants.
   - He has a strong empathy and deep love for animals, which aligns well with veterinary science.
   - High intelligence and appreciation for hard work are also suitable for this field.
   
2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which is a good fit for computer science.
   - Understanding abstract concepts is crucial for computer science.
   - However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals are less relevant here compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these observations, let's provide the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These numbers reflect the likelihood that Adam's personality traits and interests align with each field. Please note that these values are based on qualitative reasoning and not precise statistical data.
