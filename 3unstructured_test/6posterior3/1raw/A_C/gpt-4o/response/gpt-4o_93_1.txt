To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we would typically use Bayes' Theorem. However, with the information provided (the personality sketch and the fields of graduate study), we do not have prior probabilities, specific likelihoods, or rates of students in each field, so any computation will be a qualitative judgment rather than a rigorous mathematical solution.

Based on the personality sketch: 

Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, loves animals, is empathetic, has high intelligence, and appreciates hard work and dedication. These characteristics align more strongly with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, rather than computer science. 

Here is the qualitative judgment of the conditional probabilities given Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Note that these values are subjective estimates based on the given description and are not derived from a strictly quantitative analysis.
