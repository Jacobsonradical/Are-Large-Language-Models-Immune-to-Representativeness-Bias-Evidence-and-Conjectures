To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science given his personality sketch, we can employ a Bayesian approach. However, our analysis here will be qualitative and based on heuristic reasoning rather than a formal Bayesian computation with explicit priors and likelihoods.

Given the information:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, which makes him seem highly suited for agricultural and veterinary science.
- He enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, which are traits often aligned with computer science.
- He also appreciates hard work and dedication, which is a common trait needed in many fields.

Based on this qualitative reasoning, we can approximate the probabilities.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values reflect that Adam's traits seem to lean more towards a field like agricultural and veterinary science due to his love for nature and animals, but we also recognize his aptitude for abstract thinking and puzzle solving, which are important in computer science.
