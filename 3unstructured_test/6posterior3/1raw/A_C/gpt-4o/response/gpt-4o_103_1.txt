To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods for each field, we have to make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch.

From the personality sketch:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a strong empathy and love for animals.
- He is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Given these traits, we can infer a higher likelihood for Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to his interest in nature, plants, and animals. Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts also fit well with Computer Science, but his other interests push the balance towards Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Let's assign probabilities based on these qualitative assessments:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values are intuitive and reflect the stronger alignment of his personality with Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Computer Science.
