To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "computer science" given his personality sketch, we should consider how well his attributes fit with each field respectively.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Strongly aligns.
    - **Love for animals**: Direct correlation.
    - **Empathy and a warm heart**: Fits well with the nurturing aspect of veterinary science.
    - **Hard work and dedication**: Matches the demands of agricultural and veterinary careers.

2. **Computer Science**:
    - **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Common in computer science.
    - **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: Very relevant to computer science.
    - **Quiet nature**: Often found in individuals in computer science but not exclusive to it.

Both fields have relevant attributes, but given that most of Adam's personality traits (love for nature, plants, and animals, and high empathy) align more strongly with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, we can weigh the probabilities accordingly.

### Posterior Probabilities:
Using a qualitative approach based on Adam's personality traits:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These probabilities are suggestive and not precise calculations, reflecting the stronger alignment of Adam's traits with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
