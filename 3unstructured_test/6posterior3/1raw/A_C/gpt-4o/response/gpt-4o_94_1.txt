To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field based on his personality sketch, we can apply Bayes' theorem at a high level. However, without specific prior probabilities for each field or the likelihoods of a person with Adam's traits being in each field, we can only make qualitative assessments. Here is an estimation based on the provided personality sketch:

Given Adam's strong passion for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, agricultural and veterinary science seems a better fit than computer science. His intelligence and capability to understand abstract concepts also fit both fields, but his inclination towards nature-oriented and empathetic roles weighs more towards agricultural and veterinary science.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These numbers reflect the assessment that Adam's traits align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science, but there is still a non-negligible possibility that he could be in a field like computer science due to his intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles.
