To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem for our purposes is defined as: 

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of his personality sketch occurring given he is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of enrollment in that field.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of his personality sketch.

Given the qualitative nature and the incomplete data, precise numerical values for prior probabilities and personality likelihoods are not available. However, an educated estimation can be made based on the details of Adam's personality.

### Estimation of Likely Probabilities
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(B|A)**: High, since Adam's interests strongly align with nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
   - **P(A)**: Comparatively lower, as this field typically has fewer students than some other fields such as computer science.
   - **P(B)**: Not computable without comprehensive stats, but needed only for proportional consideration.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(B|A)**: Moderate, given Adam's high intelligence and abstract thinking but weakly aligning with his love for animals and nature.
   - **P(A)**: Higher, considering the large number of students generally enrolled in this field.
   - **P(B)**: Same as above for proportional consideration.

### Qualitative Estimation Based on Bayesian Approach
Taking into account Bayes' Theorem and the qualitative aspects of Adam's personality and typical enrollment statistics:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

- Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, the likelihood of him being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.65) is higher.
- Given his high intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles and abstract concepts, there is still a reasonable chance he could be enrolled in Computer Science (0.35).

These are estimations and would benefit from additional contextual data for greater precision.
