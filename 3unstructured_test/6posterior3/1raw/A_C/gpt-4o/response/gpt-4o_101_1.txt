To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities and the likelihoods based on empirical data, we must rely on qualitative assessments.

Given Adam's personality:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Love for animals.
- Strong empathy and warm heart.
- High intelligence and good at solving puzzles.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits highly align with agricultural and veterinary science due to his interest in nature and animals. Traits like high intelligence and enjoyment in solving puzzles can apply to computer science, but the strong alignment with nature and animals makes agriculture and veterinary science more likely.

Here's the qualitative posterior probability assessment:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

The values are qualitative estimates based on the alignment of his personality traits with the typical focus areas of these fields.
