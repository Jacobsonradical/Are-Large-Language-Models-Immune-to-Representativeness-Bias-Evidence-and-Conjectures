To compute the posterior probabilities, we utilize Bayesian inference, which involves updating prior beliefs based on new evidence (Adam's personality sketch). Unfortunately, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can only provide qualitative assessments rather than precise numeric values. However, considering Adam's attributes and interests, we can give an educated guess. 

Given Adam's warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for nature and plants, he seems more likely to be drawn to a field that involves working directly with animals and nature.

On the other hand, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might also make computer science a viable option, especially considering his enjoyment of solving puzzles, which is a key component of many computer science tasks.

Here's the qualitative posterior estimation:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

Rationale:
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Adam's personality traits such as love for animals, interest in nature and plants, and empathy align strongly with this field.
- "computer science": His high intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts are relevant here, but his other traits slightly edge the likelihood toward agricultural and veterinary science.
