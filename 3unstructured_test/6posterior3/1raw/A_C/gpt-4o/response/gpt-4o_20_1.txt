To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, one must apply principles from Bayesian inference, though full computation would typically require prior probabilities (base rates) for each field, as well as the likelihood of each personality trait given enrollment in each field. Given the information stated in the personality sketch, we can make a heuristic assessment of the probabilities:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals.
- He enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence, which could align with computer science.
- His strong empathy and a warm heart, as well as an appreciation for hard work and dedication, are also notable.

These points indicate that Adam has a personality that strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary sciences but might also have some suitability for computer science due to his problem-solving skills and intelligence. 

Given the lack of exact base rates and specific likelihoods, we can still make an informed guess based on the narrative provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This roughly translates to a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science, due to the alignment with Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals, while still considering some likelihood for computer science based on his intelligence and puzzle-solving enjoyment.
