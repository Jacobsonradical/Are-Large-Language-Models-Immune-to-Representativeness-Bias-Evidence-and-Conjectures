To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science given his personality sketch, we utilize a subjective Bayesian approach. This involves combining the prior likelihood of individuals in graduate fields with how well Adam’s personality traits match those expected in each field.

Given the personality sketch:

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. He is a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles.
3. He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
4. He is of high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Here's the evaluation:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, and his empathy strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - His appreciation for hard work and dedication also supports a strong fit with this field.
  
2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam’s enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence as well as his understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science.
   - However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature align less with the typical profile for this field.

Given these points, I would assign higher posterior probability to Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science due to a better match with his personality traits.

Here are the subjective probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

These values are subjective and based on how well Adam's described traits align with the characteristics generally required or beneficial in each field.
