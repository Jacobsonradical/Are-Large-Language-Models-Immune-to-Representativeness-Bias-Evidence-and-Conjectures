To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we'll need to use Bayesian reasoning. However, without explicit probabilities for each field a priori, we'll proceed with a more qualitative Bayesian inference based on the given traits.

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Computer Science**: Although Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles (traits that correlate with computer science), his strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants do not strongly align with typical interests in this field.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals strongly align with this field. Additionally, the appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with the intensive and hands-on nature of agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Given this qualitative assessment, we can estimate the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect that Adam is more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch, but there remains a possibility that he could be in computer science due to some matching characteristics such as intelligence and puzzle-solving skills.
