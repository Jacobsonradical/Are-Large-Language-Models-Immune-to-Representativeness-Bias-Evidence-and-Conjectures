To estimate the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields based on his personality sketch, we can make some reasoned qualitative assessments. However, for a precise computation, we would typically need data on the distribution of personality traits across graduate fields which is not provided here. Instead, we will apply logical inferences based on the typical personality traits associated with these fields. 

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy and deep love for animals align very well with this field. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also complements this field, which often involves intensive, hands-on work with animals and plants.

- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for abstract concepts lean toward fields like computer science, which require strong analytical skills and problem-solving abilities, often with abstract, theoretical components.

Given the qualitative nature of this analysis, these assessments are estimative inference rather than quantitatively rigorous probabilities. That said, they provide insight based on personality and field characteristics.

Here's the formatted estimation:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values are chosen to reflect the stronger alignment of his personality traits with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, while still recognizing the potential fit with Computer Science due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills.
