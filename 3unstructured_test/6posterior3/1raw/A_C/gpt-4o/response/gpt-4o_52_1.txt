These probabilities are based on the notable alignment between Adam's personality traits and the typical requirements and interests associated with each field. His love for animals, plants, and nature, along with his warm heart and empathy, strongly suggest a fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles could also make computer science a plausible field, though it might be less likely given his pronounced naturalistic and empathetic traits.
