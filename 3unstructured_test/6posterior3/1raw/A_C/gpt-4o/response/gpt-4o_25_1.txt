To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam's fields of study given his personality sketch, we can rely on the qualities and interests detailed in the sketch. Here are the updated probabilities based on the given sketch:

1. **Computer Science**: This field generally requires a high level of intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts, both of which Adam possesses. However, there isn't a direct mention of an interest in computing or technology in the sketch. Given these factors, the probability is moderate but not extremely high.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, shows empathy, and has a deep love for animals. All these traits are highly aligned with someone likely to pursue a career in agricultural and veterinary science. Given this strong alignment, we can infer a relatively high probability.

Using these assessments, here are the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
