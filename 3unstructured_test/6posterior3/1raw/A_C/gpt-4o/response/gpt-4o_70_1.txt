To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam's field of study based on his personality sketch, we need to consider how his traits align with the typical characteristics expected in those fields. Here are some relevant considerations for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - A strong appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns well with the demands of this field.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam is good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.
   - High intelligence is a common trait among computer science students.
   - However, the personality sketch emphasizes more on his empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature over a direct inclination towards computing.

Using these considerations and aligning them with the given personality traits, we can make an informed estimation of the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

These values represent conditional probabilities based on how well Adam's described personality fits each field. Agricultural and veterinary science has a higher value because more of his traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, appreciation for hard work) strongly align with this field. Computer science still holds some probability due to his intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities, but it's less emphasized in the given sketch.
