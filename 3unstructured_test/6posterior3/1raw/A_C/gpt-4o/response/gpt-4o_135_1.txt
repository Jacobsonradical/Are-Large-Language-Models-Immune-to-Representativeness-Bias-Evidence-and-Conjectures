To compute the posterior conditional probabilities given Adam's personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. However, accomplishing this computation precisely would require prior probabilities and likelihood functions that are not provided. Instead, I will provide a simplified, qualitative Bayesian reasoning approach based on the provided information about Adam:

Given the following factors from his personality sketch:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. Enjoyment in solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Let's qualitatively reason through the plausibility of each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Highly relevant.
- **Love for animals**: Highly relevant.
- **Strong empathy**: Could be relevant in terms of animal welfare.
- **High intelligence and abstract concepts**: Valuable for any field, but could be less emphasized.
- **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Relevant in all fields but particularly highlighted in practical, hands-on areas like agricultural sciences.

### Computer Science
- **Enjoyment in solving puzzles**: Highly relevant.
- **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: Highly relevant.
- **Rest of the traits (nature, animals, empathy)**: Not particularly relevant.

Based on the qualitative match of traits, Adamâ€™s personality is more strongly aligned with Agricultural and Veterinary Science than Computer Science. We can translate these qualitative matches into simplified probability judgments:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect a higher posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science given his personality sketch, compared to computer science.
