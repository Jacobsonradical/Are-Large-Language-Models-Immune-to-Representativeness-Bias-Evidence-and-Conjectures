To compute the posterior conditional probability, we consider Adam's personality sketch and how well it aligns with the characteristics and interests commonly associated with the fields of computer science and agricultural and veterinary science.

Adam's interests:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted, strong empathy, and love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

**Computer Science**:
- Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant to computer science.
- High intelligence and an appreciation for hard work are also aligned with traits that are valuable in computer science.
- However, his deep love for animals and nature does not directly correlate with this field.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- A genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and a deep love for animals, are directly relevant to this field.
- Strong empathy aligns well with the veterinary aspect of the field.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is essential in both agriculture and veterinary science.
- While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are valuable in every field, they are also beneficial in understanding complex biological systems.

Based on this analysis, the posterior conditional probabilities can be estimated as follows, assuming the base rate (prior probability) for each field is reasonably comparable:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect that while Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns with computer science, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and an appreciation for hard work make him more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
