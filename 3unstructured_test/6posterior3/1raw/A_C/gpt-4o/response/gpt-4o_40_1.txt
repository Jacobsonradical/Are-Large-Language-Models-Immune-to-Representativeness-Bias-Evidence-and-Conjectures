To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we take Adam's personality sketch and match it against the typical profiles of graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science and computer science. Since exact numerical probabilities are challenging to define without more specific data, I'll provide educated estimates based on the observable traits in Adam’s sketch.

**Personality Sketch Analysis**:
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Strongly indicative of a field like agricultural sciences.
- Warm heart, empathy, deep love for animals: Aligns well with veterinary science.
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts: Beneficial for any academic field, including computer science.
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: Suggestive of fields requiring problem-solving skills, including computer science and sciences in general.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: This is somewhat generic but applicable to rigorous academic fields.

Given these traits, let's estimate:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam’s curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals suggest a strong alignment with agricultural and veterinary sciences.
2. **Computer Science**: Adam’s intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts are important in computer science. However, the specific mention of nature and animals make agricultural and veterinary science more likely.

So, based on Adam's personality profile:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "computer science": 0.30
