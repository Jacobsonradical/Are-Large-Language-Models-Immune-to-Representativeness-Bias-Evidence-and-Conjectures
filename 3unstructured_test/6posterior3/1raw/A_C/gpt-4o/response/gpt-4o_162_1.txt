To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to utilize Bayes' theorem. However, since we are not given specific base rates (prior probabilities) or detailed likelihood information, we will make educated estimations based on the information given in Adam's personality sketch.

Adam's characteristics highlight a strong affinity for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding abstract concepts. These traits are more directly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than computer science, although high intelligence and puzzle-solving ability could also apply to computer science to some extent.

Given this information, the posterior conditional probability estimates might be:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Here, we've assigned higher probability to agricultural and veterinary science because it better matches the majority of Adam's interests and empathetic personality traits, while computer science gets a lower probability but is still considered because of his intelligence and problem-solving skills.
