To determine the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider the prior probabilities of a graduate student being in those fields, the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given those fields, and apply Bayes' theorem. However, without specific statistical data, I'll make a reasoned qualitative estimate based on typical student characteristics in these fields.

Since Adam has a strong curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, it makes agricultural and veterinary science a plausible match. Conversely, his intelligence and skill with abstract concepts could fit computer science, but the rest of his personality sketch aligns less directly with traits commonly associated with that field.

Based on these considerations, here is a subjective estimation:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

This estimation assumes a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science due to the alignment with his interests and empathy towards nature and animals, while still leaving some probability for computer science due to his intelligence and abstraction skills.
