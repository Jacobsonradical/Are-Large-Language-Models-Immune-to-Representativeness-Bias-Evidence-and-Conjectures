To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we would typically use Bayes' theorem. This requires prior probabilities for each field and the likelihood of the given characteristics for each field. Without precise numerical values for these priors and likelihoods, we can only make qualitative assessments and provide a rough estimation based on the information provided.

Given Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits make "agricultural and veterinary science" highly plausible because of his deep love for animals and curiosity about nature and plants. "Computer science" could also be a possibility due to his intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts, though it seems a less direct match compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Thus, qualitatively:

{
  "computer science": ~0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": ~0.7
}

These are subjective estimates and would ideally be informed by more specific data on prior probabilities and trait distributions across fields.
