To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we need to consider how characteristics of his personality match the typical profiles of students in these fields.

**Field: Computer Science**
- Characteristics: High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts fit well with this field. Creativity and problem-solving skills would also be important here.
- Counter-characteristics: A love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy do not directly align with the stereotypical profile of someone in computer science.

**Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
- Characteristics: A deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align very well with this field. Strong empathy and a warm heart are beneficial traits.
- Counter-characteristics: Being a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles has more overlap with many fields but would be applicable here in contexts like research and problem-solving.

Given these considerations and without additional concrete data (such as base rates of enrollments in each field):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,  // Moderate probability due to abstract thinking and intelligence.
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7  // High probability due to alignment with empathy, love for animals, and nature.
}
```

The likelihood of Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is higher given his personality traits, but it's not impossible for him to be in Computer Science due to his problem-solving skills and intelligence.
