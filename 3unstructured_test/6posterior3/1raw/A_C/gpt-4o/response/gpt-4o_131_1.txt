To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayesian inference. The formula for the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of Adam being in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Adam having the given personality traits given that he is in the specific field.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being in the specific field.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of having the given personality traits.

For simplicity, we will assume the prior probabilities (\( P(A) \)) are based on general enrollment statistics in these fields. Let's denote them as:
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = \text{P}_\text{AVS} = 0.1 \) (hypothetical value)
- \( P(\text{computer science}) = \text{P}_\text{CS} = 0.2 \) (hypothetical value)

Now we'll estimate \( P(B|A) \), i.e., the likelihood of having Adam's traits in each field:
- For agricultural and veterinary science, given his love for nature, animals, and empathy, \( P(B|\text{AVS}) \) might be quite high. We'll estimate this as 0.7 (the field aligns well with his traits).
- For computer science, given his intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts and puzzles, \( P(B|\text{CS}) \) might also be high but less aligned with empathy and love for animals. We'll estimate this as 0.4.

The overall probability of having Adam's personality traits (\( P(B) \)) could be complex to compute, so we simplify by assuming it's moderate and not dependent on the specific field. We'll denote it as \( P(B) = 0.5 \) (hypothetical assumption).

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
1. For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(\text{AVS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS})}{P(B)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = 0.14 \]

2. For computer science:
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = 0.16 \]

Thus, the computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.14,
  "computer science": 0.16
}
```

Note: The actual values might vary significantly based on real enrollment statistics, exact personality-trait distributions across fields, and more precise conditional probabilities.
