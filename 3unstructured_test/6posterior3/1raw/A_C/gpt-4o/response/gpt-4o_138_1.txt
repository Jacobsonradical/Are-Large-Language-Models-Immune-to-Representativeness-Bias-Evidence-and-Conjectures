To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science given his personality sketch, we use Bayes' theorem. However, a precise computation requires the exact prior probabilities and likelihoods, which we do not have. Instead, we'll provide a reasoned educated estimation based on the personality traits described.

### Given Traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Quiet nature, enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals.
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Reasoning:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - Deep love for animals.
   - Understanding and appreciation of hard work and dedication (applicable in farming, veterinary science).
   - These traits strongly align with a field related to nature, animals, and plants.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Enjoys solving puzzles (problem-solving skills).
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts (coding, algorithms).
   - While his empathy and love for animals are not directly related to computer science, these do not necessarily exclude him from having an interest in this field.

Based on personality fit, Adam appears more strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science due to his love for nature and animals, but his intelligence and problem-solving skills also make computer science a plausible option. Given these considerations, the probability might be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values are reasoned estimates based on alignment of traits with the fields in question, not precise calculations.
