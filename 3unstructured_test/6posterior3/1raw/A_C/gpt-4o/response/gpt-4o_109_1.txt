To compute the posterior probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem conceptually. However, without specific numerical data for priors and likelihoods, we'll infer the relative likelihoods based on the given personality sketch. Let's assess how well Adamâ€™s characteristics align with each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
   - Warm heart and deep love for animals
   - Strong empathy and appreciation for hard work

These traits are highly compatible with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Such a field requires a deep love and curiosity for nature and animals, fitting well with Adam's profile.

2. **Computer Science**
   - Enjoys solving puzzles
   - High intelligence
   - Good at understanding abstract concepts

These traits align well with fields that require logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and the ability to grasp abstract concepts, making them suitable for Computer Science.

Given Adam's strong alignment with both fields but more so with Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to his love for nature and animals, the following values can be proposed:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
