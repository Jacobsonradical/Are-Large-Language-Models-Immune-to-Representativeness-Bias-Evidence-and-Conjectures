To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given each field and apply Bayesian reasoning. However, since we do not have prior probabilities and exact conditional probabilities, we will make qualitative assessments based on the provided sketch.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, he seems highly suited for agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science.

We'll assume the following qualitative assessments:
- A high likelihood that someone with Adam's traits would enroll in agricultural and veterinary science.
- A moderate likelihood that someone with Adam's traits would enroll in computer science.

Here is an approximate qualitative assessment of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the higher compatibility of Adam's personality with agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, based on the personality traits described.
