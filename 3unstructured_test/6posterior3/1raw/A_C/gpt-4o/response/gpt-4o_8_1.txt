To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well the personality sketch fits common characteristics of individuals in each field. Although exact computation would typically require more detailed statistical data, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the given traits.

Adam's traits include:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Quiet personality and enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Here are the qualitative assessments for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants:** Highly relevant.
- **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals:** Very relevant.
- **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** Relevant for any field, but especially in practical and applied sciences.
- **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts:** Useful, though more specific to research areas.
- **Quiet personality and enjoys solving puzzles:** Not strongly indicative either way, but could fit research aspects.

### Computer Science
- **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants:** Not inherently relevant.
- **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals:** Less relevant.
- **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** Relevant for any field, especially demanding ones like computer science.
- **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts:** Very relevant.
- **Quiet personality and enjoys solving puzzles:** Quite relevant, as problem-solving is central to computer science.

Given the traits and qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

The higher probability is assigned to agricultural and veterinary science given Adam's strong alignment with nature, plants, animals, and empathy, while computer science gets a lower but non-negligible probability due to the relevance of problem-solving and abstract thinking skills.
