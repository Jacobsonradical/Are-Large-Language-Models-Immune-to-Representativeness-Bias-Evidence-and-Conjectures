To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science given his personality sketch, we can use a heuristic approach. We consider the fit between his described interests and abilities with the characteristics typically associated with these fields.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and strong empathy all align closely with this field. This field requires a deep understanding of biology and ecology, which aligns with his interests in nature and plants.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and love for solving puzzles suggest he could succeed in computer science. However, his warm heart, strong empathy, and specific interest in nature and plants make this a less likely match compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Given this analysis, the posterior conditional probabilities can be modeled as follows with heuristic values between 0 and 1:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7, 
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values reflect the stronger alignment of Adam's personality traits with agricultural and veterinary science over computer science.
