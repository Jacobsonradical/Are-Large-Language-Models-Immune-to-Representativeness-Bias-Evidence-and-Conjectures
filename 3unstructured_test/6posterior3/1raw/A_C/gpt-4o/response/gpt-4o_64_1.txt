To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science or agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch, we can employ Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

However, without concrete priors (i.e., baseline probabilities) for Adam being enrolled in each field, and the likelihoods of the personality traits given the fields, we will base our answers on qualitative analysis of his personality traits. We will use a scale between 0 and 1 to represent these probabilities.

**Qualitative Analysis:**

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **Positive Correlations:**
     - High intelligence: relevant for problem-solving and abstract thinking.
     - Enjoys solving puzzles: common among people in computer science.

   - **Negative Correlations:**
     - Strong empathy and a deep love for animals: generally more aligned with fields involving living beings rather than machines.
     - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: computer science is less focused on biological components.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **Positive Correlations:**
     - Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants: directly relevant.
     - Deep love for animals: highly aligned with veterinary science.
     - Strong empathy: important for working with living beings.
     - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: relevant for both agriculture and veterinary sciences.

   - **Negative Correlations:**
     - Not directly related to the field would be solving abstract puzzles, though it can exist in the form of problem-solving in scientific research.

Now, based on this qualitative assessment, we can assign the posterior probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

This reflects the stronger alignment of Adam's personality with agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, while also acknowledging some overlap with computer science due to his problem-solving abilities and high intelligence.
