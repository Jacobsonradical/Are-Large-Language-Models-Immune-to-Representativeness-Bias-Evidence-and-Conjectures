To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of these fields, given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well each field aligns with his described traits.

For computer science, Adam’s high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are good matches. However, his deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, and interest in plants are not directly related to this field.

For agricultural and veterinary science, Adam’s curiosity about nature and its various plants, warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals strongly align with this field. Additionally, his appreciation for hard work and dedication fits well with the demands of agricultural and veterinary studies.

Given these considerations, let's estimate the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

These values represent a higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality traits.
