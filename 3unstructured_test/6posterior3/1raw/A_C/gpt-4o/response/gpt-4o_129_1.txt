To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field based on his personality sketch, I will use a qualitative approach rather than a strict quantitative Bayesian framework, as precise prior probabilities and likelihoods aren't provided. Instead, we'll assess the relevance of his traits to each field.

Given Adam's traits, let's assess the fit for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** 
   - **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**: Strong fit
   - **Deep love for animals**: Strong fit
   - **Empathy and warm heart**: Strong fit for a field involving animal care
   - **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Relevant
   - **High intelligence**: General relevance

2. **Computer Science:**
   - **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Strong fit
   - **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: Strong fit
   - **Quiet and introspective nature**: Potentially relevant
   - **Empathy and warm heart**: Less directly relevant, though can be useful for fields like HCI or ethical hacking

Taking these trait relevancies into account:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "computer science": 0.65
}
```

Agricultural and veterinary science scores higher due to the direct relevance of Adam's traits like interest in nature, love for animals, and empathy, which align closely with the typical passions and skills needed in that field. Computer Science, while also relevant due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills, is not as closely aligned with Adam's other prominent traits like empathy and love for nature and animals.
