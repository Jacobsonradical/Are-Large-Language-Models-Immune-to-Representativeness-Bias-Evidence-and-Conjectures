When evaluating the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam's graduate field enrollment based on his personality sketch, we need to take into account the likelihood of the described traits fitting each field. 

Given:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- Has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
  
These traits are more directly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science, as this field often involves working with nature, plants, and animals. While interest in puzzles, abstract concepts, and intelligence could also fit computer science, the specific mentions of empathy, animals, and nature make agricultural and veterinary science a more compelling match.

Hereâ€™s the computed probability in the requested format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Please note these values are subjective estimations and for precise calculations, more rigorous statistical methods and additional data would be needed.
