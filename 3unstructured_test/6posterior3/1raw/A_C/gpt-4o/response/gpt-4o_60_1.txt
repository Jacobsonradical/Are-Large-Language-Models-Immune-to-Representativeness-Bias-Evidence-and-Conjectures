Given Adam's personality sketch, certain aspects such as his quiet nature, enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with the field of computer science. However, his genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are more strongly indicative of someone in agricultural and veterinary science.

Thus, the posterior conditional probability is higher for agricultural and veterinary science.
