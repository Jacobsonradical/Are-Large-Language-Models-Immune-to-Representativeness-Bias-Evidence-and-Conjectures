To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we need to consider how his traits align with the typical profiles of students in each field. While exact probabilities would require more detailed statistical data, we can provide a reasoned estimate based on the provided traits and general knowledge of the typical interests and characteristics aligned with each field.

Here's the reasoning:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**
  - His genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
  - His love for animals.
  - His warm heart and strong empathy, which are important in the care of animals.
  - Appreciation for hard work and dedication, which aligns with the demands of this field.

- **Computer Science (CS)**
  - His high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
  - His enjoyment of solving puzzles.
  - Quiet personality, which often aligns with the solitary nature of much CS work.

Given these points, we can conjecture:

1. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science, Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathetic nature make this field very suitable for him.
2. For Computer Science, his intelligence, puzzle-solving enjoyment, and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators.

However, the presence of traits like empathy and a love for animals may make AVS more likely.

Given these considerations, I'm providing the following estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These estimates reflect a reasonable alignment of Adam's personality traits with each field, though they do not sum to 1 as there are other possible fields of specialization.
