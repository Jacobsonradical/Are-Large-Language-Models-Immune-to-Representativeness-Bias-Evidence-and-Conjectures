To compute the posterior probabilities for Adam's field of study given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his personality traits align with each field. Here is a reasoning approach:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- **Curiosity about nature and plants:** Highly relevant
- **Warm heart and empathy:** Important for working with animals
- **Love for animals:** Very relevant
- **Appreciation for hard work:** Relevant

Based on these factors, the likelihood that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science is high.

**Computer Science:**
- **Enjoys solving puzzles:** Relevant
- **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts:** Highly relevant
- **Quiet nature:** Neutral but often found in the field
- **Empathy and love for animals:** Less relevant

While some traits are relevant, they are less dominantly aligned with the field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these considerations, we can estimate the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This estimation suggests that based on the given personality sketch, it is more likely that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science.
