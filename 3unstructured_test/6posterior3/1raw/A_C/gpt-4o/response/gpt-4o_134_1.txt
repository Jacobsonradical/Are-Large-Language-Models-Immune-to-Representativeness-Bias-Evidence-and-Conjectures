To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's represent the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch as \( P(Field|Personality) \). According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(Field|Personality) = \frac{P(Personality|Field) \times P(Field)}{P(Personality)} \]

Without specific base rates and likelihoods, we'll make qualitative assessments based on the provided personality sketch. 

1. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits are beneficial in computer science, which often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, and a deep love for animals. These traits align very well with fields related to agriculture and veterinary science.

Given this qualitative assessment, here are the approximate probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

These values reflect the fact that both fields are plausible but lean slightly more towards agricultural and veterinary science due to the mention of a deep love for animals and interest in nature.
