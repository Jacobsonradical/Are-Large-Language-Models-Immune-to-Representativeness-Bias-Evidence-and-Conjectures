To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider both Adam's personality traits and any prior probabilities of enrollment in the given fields.

Given:
- Adam's curiosity about nature and plants.
- His warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals.
- His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts.
- His appreciation for hard work and dedication.
- His enjoyment of solving puzzles.
- His status as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.

Let's consider the personality traits and align them with each field:
- Computer Science: Requires high intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving skills.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Aligns with curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work.

Assuming no prior knowledge of Adam's specific probability of enrollment (a common baseline where all fields are equally likely), we can use the information provided in his personality sketch to weigh the likelihoods.

Given our subjective evaluation:
1. **Adam's traits are strong indicators for Agricultural and Veterinary Science** due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
2. **For Computer Science**, most of his traits (intelligence, abstract thinking, problem-solving) are also relevant, although they are more general and fit a broader range of fields.

Given these subjective evaluations, we might assign higher weight to Agricultural and Veterinary Science. 

Since exact probabilities can't be computed without specific data and are often subjective in nature in this context, I'll provide an educated estimate. Based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the qualitative assessment that Adam's personality sketch aligns more closely with Agricultural and Veterinary Science than with Computer Science.
