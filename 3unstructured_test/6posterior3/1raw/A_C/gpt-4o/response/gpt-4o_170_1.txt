To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we'll qualitatively assess how well Adam's personality traits match the stereotypical characteristics associated with graduate students in each specified field. This is a heuristic approach and should not be considered rigorous probabilistic reasoning.

Based on Adam's traits:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work. These traits align closely with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts. While these traits are valuable and often seen in computer science students, the other aspects of his personality (nature curiosity, love for animals) don't particularly fit the common image of a computer science student.

Given this qualitative analysis, the values could be assigned as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, given his personality traits.
