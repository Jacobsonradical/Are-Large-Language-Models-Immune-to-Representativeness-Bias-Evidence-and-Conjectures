To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, given that we are not provided with specific prior probabilities or likelihoods, we can only make qualitative assessments based on the provided information.

Considering the personality sketch provided:

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
3. Adam exhibits high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
4. He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

From this, it's clear that Adam's personality aligns strongly with fields related to nature, plants, and animals, which would naturally align more with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts can also fit computer science, but the strong emphasis on nature and animals makes the other field more likely.

Using a qualitative approach, we can propose the following posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are subjective but represent a reasonable heuristic approach based on the qualitative fit between Adam's personality and the two fields mentioned.
