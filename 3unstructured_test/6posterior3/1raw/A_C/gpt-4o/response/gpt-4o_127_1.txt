Explanation:
Given Adam's personality sketch, it's clear he has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a high level of empathy and a warm heart. These traits are highly compatible with fields like agricultural and veterinary science, which explains the higher probability assigned to that field.

On the other hand, his interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests some compatibility with computer science. However, based on the available information, this match is not as strong as his fit for agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the probability for computer science is lower.
