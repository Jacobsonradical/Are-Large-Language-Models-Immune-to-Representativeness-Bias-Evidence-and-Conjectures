To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we employ Bayes' Theorem, which relates the probability of a hypothesis before and after considering new evidence.

Bayes' Theorem is stated as:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Given Adam’s personality, it's clear that:
1. He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants (indicating a possible interest in agricultural and veterinary science).
2. He has empathy and a love for animals (supporting the likelihood of veterinary science).
3. He enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts (indicating a possible interest in computer science).

Let's denote:
- \( H_{AVS} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_{CS} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was in computer science.
- \( E \) as the evidence provided by Adam’s personality sketch.

For simplicity, let's approximate based on common characteristics associated with these fields:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E \mid H_{AVS}) \) is likely high because this field directly relates to plants, nature, animals, and empathy.
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \) might be lower than computer science as fewer students traditionally major in this field.
- The exact \( P(E) \), the marginal likelihood of the evidence, can be complicated to compute without more data, but we're focusing on relative probabilities.

### Computer Science
- \( P(E \mid H_{CS}) \) may be moderate due to the interest in problem-solving and abstract concepts, but is not directly aligned with the aspects concerning nature and animals.
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) might be higher due to the popularity of this field among graduate students.

Given that:
- \( P(E \mid H_{AVS}) \) > \( P(E \mid H_{CS}) \)
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) > \( P(H_{AVS}) \)

We have to heuristically balance these probabilities on a rough scale. Assuming a prior probability balance and reasonably higher alignment of personality traits with agricultural and veterinary science, we might estimate:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

This simplistic model assumes:
- Moderate prior probabilities.
- High alignment of empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Moderate alignment of problem-solving and abstract thinking with computer science.
