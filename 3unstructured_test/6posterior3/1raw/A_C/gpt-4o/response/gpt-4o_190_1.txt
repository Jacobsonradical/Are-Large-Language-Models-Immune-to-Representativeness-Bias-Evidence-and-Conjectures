To compute the posterior conditional probabilities given Adam's personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics align with the typical traits and interests associated with these fields of study. 

Given:
1. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. Strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
3. High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
4. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.
5. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.

Let's analyze the fit for each field:

### Computer Science:
- **Pros:** High intelligence and abstract thinking are essential in computer science. Being quiet and enjoying puzzles may imply proficiency in problem-solving, which is important in this field.
- **Cons:** While his interest in nature and animals doesn't align directly, these traits are not necessarily deterrents from computer science.

Given these considerations, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science could be moderate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **Pros:** Curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and strong empathy are strong indicators for a fit in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with these fields.
- **Cons:** None of Adam's traits are in opposition to a fit in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these considerations, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science could be quite high:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Here is the combined output in the requested format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```
