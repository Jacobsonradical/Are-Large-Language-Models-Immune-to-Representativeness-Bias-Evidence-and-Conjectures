To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider Adam's personality traits and how well they match with the typical profiles of students in each of the specified fields. 

Given Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, these traits align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, while his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could fit a computer science student, his warm heart and deep empathy do not specifically indicate a strong inclination towards this field.

Let's denote:
- P(Agricultural | Personality) as the probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- P(Computer | Personality) as the probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.

Given Adam's personality traits, we can assign qualitative assessments to these fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These probabilities are subjective approximations based on the fit of Adam's personality to the typical characteristics and interests of individuals in each field.
