To compute the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "computer science" given his personality sketch, we need to consider the following aspects:

1. **Adam's Interests and Traits:**
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - Warm heart and strong empathy.
   - Deep love for animals.
   - High intelligence and problem-solving skills.

2. **Relevance to the Fields:**
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
     - Curiosity about nature and plants aligns strongly with agriculture.
     - Love for animals fits very well with veterinary science.
     - Empathy is crucial for working with animals and understanding their needs.
   - **Computer Science:**
     - High intelligence and problem-solving skills are critical in computer science.
     - Ability to understand abstract concepts fits well with the field's theoretical components.

Given these traits, it seems likely that Adam's interests align more with "agricultural and veterinary science" because of his strong connection to nature, plants, and animals. While his intelligence and problem-solving skills make computer science a feasible option, the direct indicators (like love for animals and nature) lean more heavily toward agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's denote:
- \(P(A|E)\) as the probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits.
- \(P(C|E)\) as the probability of Adam being in computer science given his personality traits.

Based on subjective assessment influenced by the above points, we might approximate as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect that while Adam could very well be interested in computer science, his personality sketch suggests a stronger alignment with agricultural and veterinary science.
