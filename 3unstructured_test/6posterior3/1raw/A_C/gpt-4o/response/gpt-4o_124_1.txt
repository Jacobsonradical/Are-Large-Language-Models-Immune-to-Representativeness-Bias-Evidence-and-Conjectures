To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" or "computer science" given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities (P(A) and P(B)) and likelihoods (P(personality sketch | A) and P(personality sketch | B)), the computation will be based on qualitative reasoning about how well Adam's personality and interests align with each field.

Given Adam's attributes:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts

These attributes strongly align with "agricultural and veterinary science" due to his nature curiosity, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit "computer science."

Therefore, the qualitative probability estimates can be reasoned as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Note that these values are qualitative and hypothetical; they express a higher likelihood of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science based on his love for nature and animals but still acknowledge a reasonable likelihood in computer science given his intelligence and abstract thinking skills.
