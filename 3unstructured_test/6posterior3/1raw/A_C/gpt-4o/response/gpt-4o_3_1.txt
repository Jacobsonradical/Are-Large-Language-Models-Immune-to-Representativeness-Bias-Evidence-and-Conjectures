Based on Adam's personality sketch, we observe certain attributes that align well with specific fields:

- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts match common traits of students in Computer Science. However, his deep love for animals and nature isn't strongly indicative of this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adamâ€™s genuine curiosity about nature and plants, along with his empathy and love for animals, strongly fits the characteristics of this field.

Considering these observations, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
