Based on Adam's personality sketch, which highlights his curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, we can make educated guesses about the likelihood of him being enrolled in various fields.

Here is the computed posterior conditional probability for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science. His interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence could fit computer science, but his stated empathy and love for animals make the agricultural and veterinary science field more probable for him.
