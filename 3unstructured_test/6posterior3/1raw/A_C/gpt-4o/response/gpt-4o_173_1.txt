To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we utilize Bayesian inference, which requires prior probabilities for each field. Given that these priors are not provided, I'll assume typical values based on the general distribution of graduate students across fields in the U.S. Furthermore, I'll use Adam's personality traits to inform the likelihood of his enrollment in each field.

Here is the analysis for each field:

1. **Computer Science**: Generally, students in computer science might share characteristics like high intelligence and a love for solving puzzles. However, empathy, love for nature, and animals are not particularly indicative of a computer science major, thus this reduces the likelihood somewhat, albeit it can still be a viable possibility due to the abstract thinking aspect.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns very well with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. Empathy and appreciation for hard work are also strong indicators for this field.

Given these considerations, it is more likely that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Computer Science.

Assuming a uniform prior probability for each field (for simplicity) and adjusting based on the likelihoods informed by Adam's personality traits, I provide the following estimates for posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are indicative and subject to change with more detailed priors and likelihood data.
