To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields based on his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, since we lack concrete prior probabilities and necessary statistical data, we will need to make informed assumptions based on the given personality traits.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and understanding abstract concepts:
- These traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science due to his interest in nature, plants, and animals.
- For computer science, while his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are relevant, there is less direct alignment with his specific passions for nature and animals.

Here is an informed qualitative assessment:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
