Explanation:

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he appears to have a strong curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits strongly align with fields related to agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the posterior conditional probability for agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high at 0.7.

In contrast, while Adam shows high intelligence and an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, which are valuable traits in computer science, his specific interests and personality traits described in the sketch do not specifically point towards computer science. Therefore, the posterior conditional probability for computer science is relatively lower at 0.2.
