To compute the posterior conditional probabilities given Adam's personality sketch, we can employ Bayes’ Theorem, which is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field \( A \) given his personality sketch \( B \).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field \( A \).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field \( A \) (before considering the personality sketch).
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.

Since the exact probabilities \( P(B|A) \), \( P(A) \), and \( P(B) \) are not provided, I'll make some reasonable estimates based on Adam's personality traits and how they fit with the two fields:

### Computer Science

**Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):**
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts favor computer science.
- Enjoys solving puzzles, which is a common trait among computer scientists.
- Warm heart and empathy are less typical of computer science students but not exclusive.

**Prior \( P(A) \):**
- Computer science is a popular field, so it might have a medium-to-high prior.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):**
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants directly aligns with this field.
- Deep love for animals is a strong indicator for veterinary science.
- Strong empathy and warm heart are typical of those working with animals and in agriculture.

**Prior \( P(A) \):**
- Agricultural and veterinary science is more specialized but very fitting with Adam's interests, so it might have a medium-to-high prior.

Given these considerations, we can make an educated guess about the posterior probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values reflect the fact that Adam’s traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science more than computer science, despite both fields being plausible given his intelligence and problem-solving abilities.
