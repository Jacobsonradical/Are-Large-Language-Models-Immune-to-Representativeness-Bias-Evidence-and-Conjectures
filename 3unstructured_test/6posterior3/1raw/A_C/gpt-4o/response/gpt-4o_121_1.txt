To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. For simplicity, we approximate the prior probabilities \( P(Field) \) for the fields based on what is generally known about graduate programs, and compute the likelihood \( P(Sketch | Field) \).

Given Adam's personality traits:

For **computer science**:
- Curiosity about nature and understanding abstracts could be relevant.
- Good at solving puzzles and high intelligence are common in computer science.
- Warm heart and empathy are less related but possible.
- Love for animals is less related.
- Understanding hard work and dedication is common in all graduate fields.

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
- Curiosity about nature and love for animals are very relevant.
- Solving puzzles is a plus but not a strong indicator.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are beneficial.
- Empathy and warm heart are highly relevant.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is common in all graduate fields.

About **Adam**:
- In 2021, Adam was a graduate student.

For simplicity, let's assume the following rough prior probabilities:
- \( P(computer\ science) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science) = 0.1 \)

Now, defining general weights to traits matching the fields:
- Computer Science (0.7 of the traits are a close match)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.9 of the traits are a close match)

Calculate posterior probabilities using normalizing constant \( K \).

\[ P(Field | Sketch) \propto P(Sketch | Field) \cdot P(Field) \]

Letâ€™s denote:
- For Computer Science: \( P(Sketch | CS) \cdot P(CS) = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 \)
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(Sketch | AG) \cdot P(AG) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 \)

Normalize with K for all possible fields (ignoring lesser probable fields).

\[ K = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 + 0.9 \cdot 0.1 \]
\[ K = 0.21 + 0.09 = 0.3 \]

Now calculating posterior probabilities:

\[ P(CS | Sketch) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.3} = \frac{0.21}{0.3} = 0.7 \]
\[ P(AG | Sketch) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.09}{0.3} = 0.3 \]

Outputting in the required format:

  "computer science": 0.7,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3
