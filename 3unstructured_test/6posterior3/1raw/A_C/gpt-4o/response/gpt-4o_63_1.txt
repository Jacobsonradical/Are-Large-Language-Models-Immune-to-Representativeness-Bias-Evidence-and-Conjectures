To compute the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science, given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. However, since we do not have explicit prior probabilities or likelihoods in this case, we will rely on qualitative reasoning to estimate the probabilities.

Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, empathy, and the fact that he has a deep love for animals, it is reasonable to assume that he is more likely to be enrolled in a field closely related to these interests, such as agricultural and veterinary science. His traits of high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are valuable in many fields, including computer science, but his personality sketch leans more heavily towards a life sciences-oriented field.

Here are approximate qualitative assessments of the probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

This distribution leans towards agricultural and veterinary science due to his strong connection with nature, plants, and animals, though his intelligence and problem-solving skills would also be valuable in computer science.
