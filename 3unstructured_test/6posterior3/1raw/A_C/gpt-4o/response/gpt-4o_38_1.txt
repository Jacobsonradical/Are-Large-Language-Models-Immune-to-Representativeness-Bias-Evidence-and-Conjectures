To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam's enrollment in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we will consider the likelihood of his personality traits fitting each field. 

1. **Computer Science:**
   - High intelligence and a good grasp of abstract concepts are strong indicators for computer science.
   - Enjoyment in solving puzzles also aligns well with the problem-solving aspects of computer science.
   - Lack of specific traits directly related to nature or animals makes this less likely compared to other fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants is a strong indicator for this field.
   - A deep love for animals aligns very clearly with veterinary science.
   - Strong empathy could be an indicator for fields involving care for living beings.
   - His understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with the demands of these fields.

Given these considerations, the posterior probabilities would reflect a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science but acknowledging some possibility for computer science due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills.

The probabilities do not total 1 because they are not exhaustive of all possible fields Adam could be enrolled in, but rather they are estimates based on the provided personality traits relative to the two specified fields.
