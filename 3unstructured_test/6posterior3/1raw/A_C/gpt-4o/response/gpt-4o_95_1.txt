Given Adam's personality sketch and his interest in nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles, we can infer likelihoods for the two fields.

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

### Explanation:

1. **Computer Science (0.2)**:
   - Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align with skills needed in computer science.
   - His enjoyment of solving puzzles is a trait often found in those who enjoy programming and algorithms.
   - However, the personality sketch emphasizes his strong connection with nature, animals, and plants, which are not typically central focuses in computer science.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8)**:
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants fits well within the realm of agricultural science.
   - His deep love for animals aligns perfectly with veterinary science.
   - His appreciation for hard work and dedication is essential in these fields, often requiring hands-on and persistent effort.
   - Strong empathy and a warm heart are crucial traits for individuals who wish to care for animals, making this a more likely career path for Adam based on his personality sketch.

Based on these factors, the higher probability is assigned to agricultural and veterinary science.
