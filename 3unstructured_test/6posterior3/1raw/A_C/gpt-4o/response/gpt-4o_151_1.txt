To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, letâ€™s consider how Adam's personality traits align with each field of study:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles, which is a relevant trait for computer science.
   - He has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, both qualities are beneficial in computer science.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, and a deep love for animals, both of which align well with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - He has strong empathy and a warm heart, traits that are good for working with animals.
   - An appreciation for hard work and dedication can apply to research and practical applications in this field.

Given the presence of these fitting traits and some overlap with both fields, we might intuit these approximate posterior probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values indicate a significantly higher likelihood that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given the specific personality traits and interests described in his sketch.
