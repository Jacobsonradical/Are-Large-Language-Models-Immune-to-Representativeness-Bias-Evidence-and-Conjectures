To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, let’s analyze the information and match it with the characteristics typically associated with each field:

### Computer Science:
- **Intelligence and abstract concepts:** High intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts are valuable in computer science.
- **Puzzle solving:** Enjoyment of solving puzzles suggests analytical skills.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **Curiosity about nature and plants:** A strong curiosity about nature and plants aligns well with this field.
- **Love for animals:** A deep love for animals directly matches this discipline.
- **Warm heart and empathy:** These traits are essential when dealing with animals and plant care.

Given the strong alignment between Adam's personality traits and Agricultural and Veterinary Science, compared to Computer Science, we can infer that the probability is higher for the former.

**Assumptions for Probabilities:**
1. Computer Science largely benefits from Adam’s intelligence and problem-solving skills but lacks direct alignment with his love for nature and animals.
2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science has a stronger alignment with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, including empathy and a warm heart.

Therefore, based on the alignment:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These probabilities reflect a stronger likelihood of Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to the more extensive overlap with his personality traits.
