To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we would ideally need some quantitative data about prior probabilities of students enrolling in each field given their personality traits and other factors. However, since such data is not provided, I'll make a qualitative assessment based on Adam's personality traits and the fields in question.

Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and empathy, these traits seem to align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might also make him a good fit for computer science. However, there is less direct evidence in his personality sketch to suggest a specific interest in digital technology or computer-related activities.

Based on the available information, I would estimate the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These probabilities are subjective and reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science given his interests and traits. However, the probability for computer science is not zero, considering his intelligence and problem-solving skills.
