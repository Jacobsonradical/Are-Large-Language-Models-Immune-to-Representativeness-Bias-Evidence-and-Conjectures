To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we can use a qualitative Bayesian reasoning approach based on the given traits and commonalities with each field of study.

We know that:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is of high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Considering these characteristics:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Curiosity about nature and plants directly aligns with agricultural science.
   - A deep love for animals aligns with veterinary science.
   - Empathy and a warm heart could imply a tendency towards caring professions, such as veterinary science.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns with both fields, as they require significant commitment.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Enjoys solving puzzles, which is a key trait for computer scientists.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are aligned with computer science.
   - However, there is less direct connection to Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy.

Given these points, we can qualitatively assess the probabilities. While these are not derived from precise numerical data, they offer a reasoned estimate based on the alignment of traits. 

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This estimate reflects that Adam's personality traits—particularly his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and dedication—align more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. While his enjoyment of puzzles and intelligence also suit computer science, the overall fit with agricultural and veterinary science is considered stronger.
