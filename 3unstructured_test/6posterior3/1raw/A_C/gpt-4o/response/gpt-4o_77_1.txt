Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science due to his strong curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, traits that align well with this field. While his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also suit computer science, it appears less aligned with his expressed interests and empathy for living beings.
