To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, let's use Bayesian reasoning. However, please note that we do not have explicit prior probabilities or a dataset to perform rigorous calculations. Instead, we have to make educated guesses based on his personality traits and interests.

Here are the key points from Adam's personality sketch:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
3. Solving puzzles, high intelligence, and good understanding of abstract concepts.
4. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these traits, let's consider the likelihoods:

### Computer Science
- Solving puzzles and high intelligence suit a computer science profile.
- Good understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.
- However, there is no direct mention of an interest in technology or programming.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants strongly aligns with this field.
- Deep love for animals is a strong indicator for veterinary sciences.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication fits well, as these fields often require such attributes.

Based on these considerations, we might surmise that the likelihood of Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is higher than him being in Computer Science.

### Posterior Conditional Probabilities
Let's assign educated guesses for these probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Please note these values are subjective estimations based on the given personality traits. Without more rigorous statistical methods and data, these probabilities represent a reasoned but imprecise analysis.
