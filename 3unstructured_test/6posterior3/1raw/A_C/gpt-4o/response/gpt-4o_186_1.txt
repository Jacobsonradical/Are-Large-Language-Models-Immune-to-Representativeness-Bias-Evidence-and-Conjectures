To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning. The equation for posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of A given B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of B.

In this context:
- A represents the field of study (either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science).
- B represents the personality and interests of Adam as provided in the sketch.

While exact values for all these probabilities are not provided, we can qualitatively assess the likelihoods based on the information given.

For **computer science**:
- **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):** Adam is described as intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which are good fits for computer science. He also enjoys solving puzzles, another strong indicator for computer science.
- **Prior probability \( P(A) \):** Computer science is a popular field of study.

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
- **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):** Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work are strong indicators.
- **Prior probability \( P(A) \):** Agricultural and veterinary science, while less popular than computer science, has a decent number of enrollments, especially among those with the traits described.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign plausible probabilities. Without exact data, this is an estimation based on reasoning:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
```

These values are reflective of the likelihoods based on Adam's personality sketch. Agricultural and veterinary science gets a slightly higher probability because the traits described align more closely with typical dispositions in that field. Computer science is also plausible due to Adam's abstract thinking and puzzle-solving abilities but less aligned with his love for animals and nature.
