To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we use Bayes' Theorem. However, this typical detailed calculation requires prior probabilities for each field and the likelihood of each personality trait given that Adam is in each field. In the absence of specific numerical data, we'll use qualitative reasoning to assess these probabilities.

1. **Computer Science**: Given Adam's traits, a strong intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts align with skills needed in computer science. However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals might be less directly correlated with the stereotypical traits of computer science students.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align strongly with the typical interests and attributes of someone in agricultural and veterinary science. His empathy and warm heart also suggest he might be more drawn to fields involving living beings and nature directly.

Based on this reasoning, we can loosely estimate the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values indicate that Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, considering his personality traits.
