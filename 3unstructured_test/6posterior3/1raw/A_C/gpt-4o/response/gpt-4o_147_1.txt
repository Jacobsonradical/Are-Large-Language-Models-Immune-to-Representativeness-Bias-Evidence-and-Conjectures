To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science given his personality sketch, you would typically use Bayesian reasoning. However, without specific datasets detailing prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can only provide a qualitative estimate based on the information given.

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam has a deep love for nature, plants, and animals, a strong appreciation for hard work, and high intelligence with an ability to understand abstract concepts. These traits suggest a strong alignment with agricultural and veterinary science. While his love for solving puzzles and high intelligence are also traits that align with computer science, the emphases on nature, plants, and animals seem more strongly indicative of a field related to those interests.

With these considerations in mind, we can estimate the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values are not derived from statistical calculations but rather from a qualitative analysis of the given personality sketch and the field characteristics.
