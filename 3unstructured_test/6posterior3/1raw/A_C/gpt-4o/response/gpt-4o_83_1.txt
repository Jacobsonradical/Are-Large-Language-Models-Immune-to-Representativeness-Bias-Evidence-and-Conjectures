The posterior conditional probabilities can be analyzed by considering the alignment between Adam's personality traits and the typical attributes and interests associated with each field. While we don't have specific base rates or precise data to calculate exact probabilities, we can make an educated estimation based on the given personality sketch.

Given the personality sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Loves solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence, good at abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Here's an estimation of the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.25,  // Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which align well with computer science.
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70  // Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication strongly align with this field.
}

The remaining 0.05 proportion accounts for the possibility of Adam being interested in other fields that might also fit his personality traits to some degree.
