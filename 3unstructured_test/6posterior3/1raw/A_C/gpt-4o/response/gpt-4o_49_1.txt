To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we would typically apply Bayes' theorem, which requires knowledge of the prior probabilities of each field and the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given each field. However, since we don't have specific numerical values and distributions, I'll provide qualitative estimations based on the information given.

Considering Adam's personality traits such as his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it seems reasonable to infer that these traits align more naturally with the field of Agricultural and Veterinary Science than they do with Computer Science.

On the other hand, Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts are traits often valued in Computer Science.

Given these considerations, here are the estimated posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7, 
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This estimation reflects a higher likelihood for Adam to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to his strong affinity for nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work. However, his intelligence and problem-solving skills imply there is still a significant probability for him to be in Computer Science as well.
