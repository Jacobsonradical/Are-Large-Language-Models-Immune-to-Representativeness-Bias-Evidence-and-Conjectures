To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in a specific field based on his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his personality traits align with the common attributes associated with each field. Let’s critically analyze the information given:

1. **Computer Science**: This field often requires a strong aptitude for problem-solving, logical thinking, and understanding abstract concepts. Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, making him a good fit for computer science.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field often requires empathy, a love for nature and animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. Adam's deep love for animals, strong empathy, and curiosity about nature suggest he would be well-suited for this field.

Given this analysis, here are the computed posterior conditional probabilities for each field based on Adam’s personality sketch. Note that these probabilities are subjective and based on the alignment of his attributes with each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

The probability for "agricultural and veterinary science" is higher because more of Adam's traits align closely with the attributes commonly associated with this field.
