To compute the posterior probabilities, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of A given B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of B.

Let's denote:
- \( A_1 \) as Adam being enrolled in "computer science."
- \( A_2 \) as Adam being enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science."

To compute \( P(A_1|\text{personality}) \) and \( P(A_2|\text{personality}) \), we need prior probabilities and likelihoods based on the personality sketch.

We can start with some simplifying assumptions based on the context and personality alignment:

### Assumptions:

#### Priors:
1. \( P(\text{computer science}) \): The prior probability that any random graduate student is in computer science.
2. \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): The prior probability that any random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science.

For simplification:
- Let's assume \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.20 \).
- Let's assume \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.05 \).

#### Likelihoods:
1. \( P(\text{personality}|\text{computer science}) \): The probability of Adam's personality given that he is in computer science.
2. \( P(\text{personality}|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): The probability of Adam's personality given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on the personality sketch:
- Adamâ€™s traits, such as love for animals and nature, strong empathy, quiet demeanor, high intelligence, and enjoyment of abstract concepts, seem to align more with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume:
  - \( P(\text{personality}|\text{computer science}) = 0.20 \)
  - \( P(\text{personality}|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.70 \)

### Calculation:

We need a normalization constant \( P(\text{personality}) \), which can be computed as follows:

\[ P(\text{personality}) = P(\text{personality}|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(\text{personality}|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]

\[ P(\text{personality}) = (0.20 \times 0.20) + (0.70 \times 0.05) \]

\[ P(\text{personality}) = 0.04 + 0.035 \]

\[ P(\text{personality}) = 0.075 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|\text{personality}) = \frac{P(\text{personality}|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(\text{personality})} \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|\text{personality}) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.20}{0.075} \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|\text{personality}) = \frac{0.04}{0.075} \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|\text{personality}) \approx 0.533 \]

And for agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|\text{personality}) = \frac{P(\text{personality}|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(\text{personality})} \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|\text{personality}) = \frac{0.70 \times 0.05}{0.075} \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|\text{personality}) = \frac{0.035}{0.075} \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|\text{personality}) \approx 0.467 \]

### Result:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.533,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.467
}
