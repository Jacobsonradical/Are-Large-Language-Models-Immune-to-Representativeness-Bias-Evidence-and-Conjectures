To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with each field of study. Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, these traits align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than computer science. While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit either field, his specific interests tilt the balance towards agricultural and veterinary science.

Using a qualitative reasoning approach and Bayesian logic:

1. Computer Science: Traits associated with this field primarily include high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and interest in solving puzzles. However, there is no direct mention of an interest in technology, programming or computer systems in Adam's sketch.

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Traits such as curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy strongly align with this field.

Based on this qualitative analysis:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values reflect the stronger alignment of Adam's personality with agricultural and veterinary science based on the details provided in the sketch.
