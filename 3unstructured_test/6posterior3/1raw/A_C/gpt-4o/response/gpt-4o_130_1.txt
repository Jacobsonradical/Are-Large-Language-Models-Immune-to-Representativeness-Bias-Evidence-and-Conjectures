To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits align with the typical characteristics of students in each field. 

Let's evaluate the fit for each field based on the provided sketch:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are significant factors in computer science.
   - Solving puzzles correlates well with problem-solving and logical thinking required in computer science.
   However:
   - Curiosity about nature and empathy for animals are not particularly aligned with typical computer science students.

   Given this, Adam's alignment with traits typical for computer science students is moderate.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants is highly relevant.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals align very well with veterinary science.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication is crucial in the demanding field of agriculture and veterinary science.
   - High intelligence is beneficial in any graduate field, including agricultural and veterinary science.

   Given this, Adam's alignment with traits typical for agricultural and veterinary science students is very high.

Taking these considerations into account, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These probabilities reflect that Adam's personality traits match much more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than with computer science.
