To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, one should ideally use Bayes' Theorem, which requires prior probabilities and the likelihoods associated with each observation. In the absence of concrete prior probabilities and detailed likelihoods, we can only make an educated guess based on his personality sketch and the affinity of that sketch with each field.

Given the information about Adam—his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication—the following educated estimates take into account attributes more aligned or less aligned with each field:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam’s keen interest in nature and love for animals strongly align with this field. 
- Computer Science: While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with computer science, there are fewer indicators in his description suggesting a specific passion for this field compared to the strong indicators for agricultural and veterinary science.

With these considerations:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,  # moderately plausible given his intelligence but fewer direct personality indicators
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7  # strongly aligned with his curiosity about nature and love for animals 
}

These values are heuristic estimates based on alignment with the described personality traits rather than rigorous statistical calculations.
