To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field based on his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, without empirical data on the base rates of students in each field and likelihoods of possessing the given personality traits in each field, providing precise numerical probabilities is challenging. We can qualitatively assess the relative fit based on his characteristics.

Given Adam's strong affinity for nature, animals, plants, empathy, and high intelligence, it is more likely that he will be inclined towards fields aligning with these traits. 

Here's a qualitative estimate of the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,  // Lower likelihood due to lack of direct alignment with a love for nature and animals.
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7  // Higher likelihood due to direct alignment with his empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature.
}

Note: These values are illustrative and based on qualitative assumptions rather than precise calculations. For exact values, one would need statistical data specific to these fields.
