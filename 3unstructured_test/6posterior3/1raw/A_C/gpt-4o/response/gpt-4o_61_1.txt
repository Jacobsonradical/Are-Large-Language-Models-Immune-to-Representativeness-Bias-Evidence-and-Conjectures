To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we can use Bayes' Theorem. However, due to the lack of specific prior probabilities and likelihoods (data about graduate student distributions by field and personality traits), we will make some qualitative assessments based on the information provided about Adam and typical characteristics of students in the respective fields.

Adam seems to have characteristics that align particularly well with agricultural and veterinary science such as:
- A genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- A love for animals
- Strong empathy and appreciation for hard work

For computer science, while intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles are highly relevant traits, the specific aspects related to nature, empathy, and love for animals are less directly connected to typical pursuits within that field.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can propose the following posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

This means there is a higher posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits, though there remains a smaller (but non-negligible) chance that he was enrolled in computer science.
