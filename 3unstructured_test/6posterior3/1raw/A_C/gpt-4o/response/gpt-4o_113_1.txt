To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we would generally use Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in each field and precise likelihoods from his personality sketch, I will make reasonable assumptions based on the given information.

Adam has a deep love for animals, a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, and strong empathy, which aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could be relevant to computer science, but these traits are not exclusive to that field. High intelligence is a general trait that could apply to any field of graduate study.

Here are the inferred posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values reflect that, based on the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science, though the possibility of the latter cannot be entirely ruled out.
