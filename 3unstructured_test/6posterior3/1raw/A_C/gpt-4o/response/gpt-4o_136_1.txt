To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science given his personality sketch, we can use some simplifications based on Bayes' Theorem. However, without concrete prior probabilities and likelihoods, this computation will incorporate intuitive assessments based on the personality traits presented.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with his strong empathy and love for animals, he seems more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, his high intelligence, enjoyment of puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking could align with computer science.

Nonetheless, certain aspects of his personality - such as his empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature - could weigh more heavily towards agricultural and veterinary science.

Here's an intuitive estimate of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This considers the strong alignment of specific traits (empathy, love for animals, nature curiosity) with agricultural and veterinary science. However, it recognizes that his intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles also suggest some probability for computer science.
