Determining the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific graduate field requires the principle of Bayesian inference. This combines prior probabilities (concerning how likely anyone is to be enrolled in these fields) with the likelihood (how well his personality fits each field). Here, we lack concrete data for prior probabilities or likelihoods, so we'll need to estimate them qualitatively based on his traits and the general characteristics of each field.

Given Adam's traits:

1. Loves nature, plants, and animals.
2. Is quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Is intelligent and good at abstract concepts.
4. Has strong empathy and appreciation for dedication.

We will informally evaluate the likelihood:

- **Computer Science (CS):** 
  - Positives: Intelligent, good at abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles.
  - Neutrals/Mixed: Quiet demeanor (can be mixed depending on the nature of the computational work).
  - Negatives: His strong preference for nature, plants, and animals is not a typical marker for CS.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS):**
  - Positives: Loves nature, plants, and animals, strong empathy, appreciation for hard work.
  - Neutrals/Mixed: Quiet demeanor (usually neutral as this is a broad field).
  - Negatives: Fewer specific markers for abstract or puzzle-solving compared to CS, though this field does require some intellectual rigor.

Hence, Adam's personality seems a stronger fit for AVS than CS due to his love of nature and animals. Here's a qualitative estimate of posterior probabilities based on these factors:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These numbers reflect a higher likelihood that Adamâ€™s interests and personality align more closely with AVS, but also acknowledge that his intellectual abilities and enjoyment of puzzles can align with CS to some extent.
