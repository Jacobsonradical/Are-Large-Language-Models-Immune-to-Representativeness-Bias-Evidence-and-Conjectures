Explanation:
Given Adam's personality sketch, he has a strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, and possesses a warm heart and high empathy. These traits align more closely with fields that involve life sciences, such as agricultural and veterinary science. Though he is intelligent and good at solving puzzles, which could point towards computer science, his deep love for animals and nature suggests a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, the probability of him being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is higher than in computer science.
