To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we would generally use Bayes' Theorem. However, due to the lack of specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, this computation will be based on qualitative assessment of the provided personality sketch.

### Personality Sketch Analysis:
- **Curiosity about nature and plants**: This aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Solving puzzles and high intelligence**: These traits are common in fields like computer science.
- **Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals**: Strongly points towards agricultural and veterinary science, especially veterinary science.
- **Understanding abstract concepts**: Relevant for computer science.
- **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This is a neutral trait that can apply to either field but is particularly important in rigorous academic and practical fields like veterinary science.

Given these observations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This suggests a higher likelihood that Adam's personality and interests align with agricultural and veterinary science over computer science, mainly driven by his curiosity for nature, love for animals, and empathy.
