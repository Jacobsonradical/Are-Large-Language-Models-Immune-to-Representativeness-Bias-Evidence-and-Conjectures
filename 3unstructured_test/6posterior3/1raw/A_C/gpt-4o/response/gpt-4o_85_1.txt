To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to make some reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch and compare how well his traits match each field. This approach isn't precise and quantitative without extensive survey or statistical data, but we'll use our qualitative understanding.

Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, these traits strongly align him with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles could fit well with computer science but are not as directly indicated by his interests and natural inclinations.

Let's use this qualitative analysis to assign some reasonable probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

In this context, the probabilities reflect a stronger alignment of Adam's personality with agricultural and veterinary science but also acknowledge that his intellectual traits could still make him fit for computer science.
