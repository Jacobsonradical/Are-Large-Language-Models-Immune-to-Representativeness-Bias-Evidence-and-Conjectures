To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific base rates of students in each field and the likelihood of the specified characteristics for each field, we'll make qualitative judgments based on the given description.

Given Adam's personality sketch, let's evaluate each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Relevance of curiosity about nature/plants: Low.
   - Solving puzzles: High.
   - Warm heart and empathy: Generally neutral but can be beneficial in collaborative environments.
   - Love for animals: Low relevance.
   - High intelligence/abstract concepts: High.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Relevance of curiosity about nature/plants: Very High.
   - Solving puzzles: High.
   - Warm heart and empathy: Very High.
   - Love for animals: Very High.
   - High intelligence/abstract concepts: High.

While Adamâ€™s intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles would be beneficial in Computer Science, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature make Agricultural and Veterinary Science a more likely fit.

Therefore, the posterior probabilities can be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values indicate a higher probability that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science given his personality sketch.
