To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields based on his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities for each field and detailed likelihood functions for Adam's traits given each field, we can only make an informed qualitative assessment.

Given Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, it seems more likely that his personality aligns with fields that involve interaction with and study of living organisms. On the other hand, while his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make sense for computer science, his other traits do not as strongly suggest this field.

With this reasoning, we can estimate the conditional probabilities as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,  // This reflects his intelligence and problem-solving ability, albeit not a strong fit.
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8  // This aligns well with his love for animals, nature, and empathy.
}

These probabilities are qualitative and based on the provided information about Adam.
