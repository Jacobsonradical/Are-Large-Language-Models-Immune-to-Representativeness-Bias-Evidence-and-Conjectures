To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Given that we don't have specific prior probabilities for different graduate fields, we can rely on the qualitative match between Adam's personality and the typical attributes required or common in these fields.

1. **Computer Science**: This field often requires strong problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and a good understanding of abstract concepts. Adam's interest in solving puzzles and his high intelligence align well with these requirements. However, the personality sketch does not mention a strong interest in technology or computer-related activities, which might be a common trait among computer science students.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field has a closer alignment with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and strong love for animals. The empathy and warm-hearted qualities, along with the appreciation for hard work and dedication, are also supportive of a career in agricultural and veterinary science.

Considering these qualitative matches, we can assign subjective probabilities to each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

The reasoning here is that while Adam's qualities of high intelligence and problem-solving skills are conducive to computer science, his strong empathy, love for nature and animals, and appreciation for hard work align more directly with agricultural and veterinary science.
