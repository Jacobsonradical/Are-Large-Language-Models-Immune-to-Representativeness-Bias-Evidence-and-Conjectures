To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the fields of study, given his personality sketch, let's make some reasonable assumptions based on the information provided. 

We will base our estimation on how closely Adamâ€™s characteristics fit the stereotypical traits necessary or beneficial for each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants (very relevant)
   - Deep love for animals (very relevant)
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication (highly relevant)
   
2. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts (very relevant)
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles (relevant)
   - Quiet nature (possibly relevant, but less direct)

Given these rationales, let's estimate the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

The probability for "agricultural and veterinary science" is higher due to the highly relevant traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, all of which are crucial in this field. 

The probability for "computer science" is moderate because even though Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is intelligent with an understanding of abstract concepts, his empathy and love for nature might not be as directly relevant to this field.
