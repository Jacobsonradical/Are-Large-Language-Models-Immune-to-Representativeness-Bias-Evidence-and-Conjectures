  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

The reasoning behind these estimations is as follows:

- Based on Adam's personality traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, strong empathy, and warmth, it is more likely that he was enrolled in a field closely related to life sciences. Hence, the likelihood of agricultural and veterinary science is higher.
- However, his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are traits that can also be found in successful computer science students, although they are not directly aligned with his emphasized interests in nature and animals. Therefore, there is still a reasonable probability that he could be enrolled in computer science.
