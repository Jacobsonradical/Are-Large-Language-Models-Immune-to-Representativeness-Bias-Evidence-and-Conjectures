Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses based on his interests and traits. However, it's important to note that without specific statistical data, these values are subjective estimates based on the information provided.

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, understanding of hard work, and appreciation for nature's plants strongly indicate a suitability for fields closely related to those interests, such as agricultural and veterinary science. While his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might fit the profile of someone studying computer science, his personal inclinations towards nature and animals make it less likely, albeit not impossible.

Here is an estimate of the posterior probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values reflect a stronger likelihood that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch.
