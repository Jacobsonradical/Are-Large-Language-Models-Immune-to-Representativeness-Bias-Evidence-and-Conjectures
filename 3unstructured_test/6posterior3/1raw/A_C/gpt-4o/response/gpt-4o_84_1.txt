To compute the posterior conditional probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, since we do not have the prior probabilities or likelihoods given explicitly, we will base our estimates on how well his personality traits match typical characteristics of students in each field.

Adam's traits suggest strong compatibility with fields that involve nature, animals, and possibly abstract thinking. Based on this qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.2):** While Adam is capable of abstract thinking and high intelligence, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are not primary indicators for someone typically drawn to computer science.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adamâ€™s traits strongly align with this field due to his love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, all of which are crucial for success and interest in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
