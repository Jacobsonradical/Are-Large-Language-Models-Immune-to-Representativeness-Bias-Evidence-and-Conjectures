To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we must consider how well his described traits align with the typical traits and interests of individuals in these fields.

### Computer Science:
- **Genuine curiosity**: Relates well as computer scientists often need deep curiosity about systems and problem-solving.
- **Solving puzzles**: Matches well since programming and algorithm design are akin to solving complex puzzles.
- **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: Highly relevant as computer science involves abstract reasoning and technical expertise.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**: Directly relevant, as these fields deeply involve nature.
- **Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals**: Directly relevant, especially for veterinary science, which deals with animal care.
- **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Relevant, as working with plants and animals requires considerable diligence and commitment.

Given these considerations, it seems that Adam's personality and interests align more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. Hence, the probabilities would generally skew more towards agricultural and veterinary science but still reflect some potential fit for computer science.

So, a reasonable estimation could be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
