To compute the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in a specific graduate field given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of A given B (what we are trying to find)
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of B given A (the likelihood)
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A (the initial probability before considering the evidence)
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of B (the total probability of the evidence)

For simplicity, we'll make some assumptions (without actual numerical priors and likelihoods from data, we will estimate the relationships qualitatively):

- \( P(Agricultural \, and \, Veterinary \, Science) \): A moderate likelihood based on Adam's love for animals and appreciation for dedication.
- \( P(Computer \, Science) \): A lower likelihood based on his traits, though his enjoyment of solving puzzles and intelligence in abstract concepts somewhat align.

Given Adam's personality sketch, we can hypothesize that his traits are more indicative of someone in "agricultural and veterinary science" than "computer science."

So, we will estimate qualitatively as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

This estimation shows that Adam is likelier to be enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" than "computer science," based on the provided personality traits. The remaining probability space accounts for other possible fields Adam might be in, reflecting the fact that we lack complete information.
