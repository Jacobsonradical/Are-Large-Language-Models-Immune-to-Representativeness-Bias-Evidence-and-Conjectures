To compute the posterior conditional probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each of the specified fields given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. However, because we don't have actual statistical distributions or prior probabilities for Adam's enrollment in these fields, we need to make a qualitative assessment based on the information provided. This process involves assessing how well Adam's characteristics align with common traits expected in each field. 

### Analysis:
1. **Business Administration:**
   - Key Traits for Business Administration: Leadership, strategic thinking, communication skills, analytical skills.
   - Adam does not exhibit a strong alignment with these traits. His interest in nature, puzzles, empathy, and abstract understanding seem less directly related to business-oriented skills.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Key Traits for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Interest in plants and animals, empathy, understanding of natural systems, dedication to care, and often scientific curiosity.
   - Adam's traits match very well with this field. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are strong indicators.

3. **Computer Science:**
   - Key Traits for Computer Science: Problem-solving, interest in technology, high intelligence, abstract thinking, and often a love for puzzles.
   - Adamâ€™s enjoyment in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.

Based on this qualitative analysis:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

- **Business Administration** receives a low value (0.1) as Adam's personality traits are not a strong match for this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** is assigned a high value (0.7) due to multiple direct alignments with Adam's interests and values.
- **Computer Science** is given a moderate value (0.3) since his interest in puzzles and abstract thinking fits well but not as perfectly as the agricultural field. 

Note that these values are relative probabilities based on qualitative assessment and should not be considered definitive without empirical data.
