To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we can use a heuristic approach based on how well his characteristics match common attributes of students in each field. Note that these values will be subjective estimates, as calculating precise probabilities would require specific data on the distribution of personality traits within each academic field.

Based on Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, empathy, intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and problem-solving skills, the fit seems strongest for Agricultural and Veterinary Science. His intelligence and problem-solving skills suggest a reasonable fit for Computer Science, but his empathy and love for nature and animals might be less typical in that field. Business Administration seems the least likely given his described attributes, as this field often emphasizes different skill sets like leadership, communication, and strategic thinking, which are not highlighted in his personality sketch.

Here are the subjective probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
These estimates reflect the likelihood that his personality and interests align with each field, but keep in mind they are based on general perceptions rather than precise statistical data.
