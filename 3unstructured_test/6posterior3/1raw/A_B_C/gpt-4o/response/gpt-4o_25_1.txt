To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields based on his personality sketch, we can take a Bayesian approach. We need to consider how well Adam's characteristics match typical students in each of these fields.

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - Common traits: High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles.
   - Less relevant traits: Curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Common traits: Curiosity about nature, love for animals, appreciation for hard work.
   - Less relevant traits: High intelligence, solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts.

3. **Business Administration**: 
   - Common traits: Appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - Less relevant traits: Love for nature, solving puzzles, love for animals, strong empathy.

Given Adam's characteristics and how they align with each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

- **Computer Science** gets a higher probability of 0.5 due to Adam's high intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving skills.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** gets the highest probability of 0.8 because of Adam's love for nature, animals, and his empathy, which strongly align with this field.
- **Business Administration** gets a lower probability of 0.2 as the primary matching trait is an appreciation for hard work, which is less distinctive compared to other fields. 

These probabilities reflect how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with typical characteristics of students in these fields.
