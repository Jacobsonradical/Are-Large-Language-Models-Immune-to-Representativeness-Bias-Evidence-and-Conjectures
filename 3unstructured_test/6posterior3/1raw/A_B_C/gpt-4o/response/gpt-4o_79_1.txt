To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we need to consider how well Adam's traits match commonly associated traits in each field. This involves evaluating the likelihood of Adam having these traits given each field and considering some base rate information for each field.

Since specific base rates for each field are not provided, we'll use general intuition about the fit of Adam's traits to the three fields in question:

1. Business administration:
   - Traits such as a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals are less commonly emphasized.
   - High intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts can be useful.
   - Overall, a lower probability, as business administration typically demands different primary traits.

2. Computer science:
   - High intelligence and a good grasp of abstract concepts fit well with this field.
   - Enjoying solving puzzles is a good match.
   - Although curiosity about nature and empathy are less directly related, they do not exclude computer science.
   - Medium probability due to the mixed fit of traits.

3. Agricultural and veterinary science:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and empathy are highly relevant.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are also beneficial.
   - Much higher probability due to the strong alignment with relevant traits.

Based on this qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Note: These values are rough estimates reflecting how well Adamâ€™s traits fit each field. The values are not meant to be precise or based on rigorous statistical data but serve to illustrate the relative likelihood. Remember, the actual probabilities could vary depending on many factors such as specific curricular outcomes, personal preferences, and more detailed data about the fields.
