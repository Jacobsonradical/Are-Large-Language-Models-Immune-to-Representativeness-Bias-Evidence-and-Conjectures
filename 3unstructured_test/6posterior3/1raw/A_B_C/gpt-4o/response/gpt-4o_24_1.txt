To compute the posterior probabilities for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning. We need to consider how well each field aligns with his described traits and interests.

Adam's traits and interests include:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Empathy and a warm heart
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication
- Enjoying solving puzzles

These traits can help us determine how likely they align with each field:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts are good fits for computer science. However, his strong interest in nature and animals seems less aligned. 
2. **Business Administration**: While dedication and empathy might be relevant here, Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and preference for quieter activities are less aligned with this field.
3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field is closely related to Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals. His empathy and warm heart also resonate with the caring aspects of veterinary science.

Based on these considerations, let's assign posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are not exact mathematical computations but educated estimations based on how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with each field.
