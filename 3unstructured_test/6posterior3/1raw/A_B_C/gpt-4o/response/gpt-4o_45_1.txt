Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make educated guesses about the likelihood of his enrollment in each of the specified fields. Here are the posterior conditional probabilities:

- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its plants and his deep love for animals make him particularly suited for agricultural and veterinary science.
- His high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are valuable in computer science.
- His warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication can be beneficial in business administration, although these traits seem more aligned with fields involving empathy and nature.

Based on these qualitative assessments, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are subjective and based on the available information. The probability for agricultural and veterinary science is notably higher due to the strong alignment with Adam's interests and traits.
