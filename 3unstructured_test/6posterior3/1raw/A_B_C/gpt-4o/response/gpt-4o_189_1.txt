To compute the posterior probabilities for each of the fields given Adam's personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. However, without specific numerical values for the prior probabilities or the likelihoods, we will use qualitative reasoning based on the information provided.

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, as well as his deep love for animals, this field is highly relevant. His strong empathy and appreciation for hard work also align well with this specialization.

* **Business Administration**: Adam's personality traits don't strongly indicate a natural fit for business administration. His interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his quiet demeanor, suggest a lower probability for this field.

* **Computer Science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which could align with computer science, there is no specific mention of an interest in technology or computers. Thus, the probability is moderate but not as high as for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Based on this qualitative analysis, here are the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
