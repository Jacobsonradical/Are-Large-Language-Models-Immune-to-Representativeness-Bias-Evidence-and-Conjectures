To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the given fields based on his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayesian reasoning. While exact numerical values for prior probabilities and likelihoods are not provided, we can qualitatively assess the alignment of his personality with each field to provide reasonable probability values between 0 and 1.

Here's the assessment based on the available information:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science.
   - Enjoying solving puzzles also aligns well with this field.
   - However, there are no explicit mentions of a specific interest in technology or computing.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants aligns very well.
   - Strong empathy and deep love for animals are highly relevant here.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication fits well with the practical aspects of agricultural and veterinary fields.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - While high intelligence and appreciation for hard work are positive indicators, there is no direct indication of an interest in business, economics, or management.
   - Warm heart and strong empathy might be beneficial in human resource management but are not highly indicative of a preference for this field based on the given sketch.

Given these qualitative assessments, here's the subjective posterior conditional probability distribution:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Note: These values are subjective estimates based on the provided personality characteristics and their alignment with the traits typically associated with each field. More precise calculation would require additional data on the base rates of students in each field and more specific indicators of Adam's interests.
