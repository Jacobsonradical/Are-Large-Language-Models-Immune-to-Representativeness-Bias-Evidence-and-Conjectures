To provide a posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the fields of agricultural and veterinary science, business administration, and computer science based on his personality sketch, we need to assess the likelihood that his characteristics match the profile typically expected in each field. Here are the computed probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

These probabilities reflect the higher correlation between Adam's attributes (curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, empathy) and the field of agricultural and veterinary science, as compared to the other fields.
