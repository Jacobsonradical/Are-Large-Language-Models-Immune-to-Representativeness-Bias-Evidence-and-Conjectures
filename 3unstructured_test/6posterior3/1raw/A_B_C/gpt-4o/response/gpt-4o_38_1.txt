To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with typical characteristics and interests of students in each of the fields mentioned, as well as the base rates (prior probabilities) of students in these fields. Since we don't have explicit base rates, we'll make some assumptions based on common expectations.

Given Adam's characteristics:
- Curiosity about nature and plants suggests a possible fit with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence could align with computer science.
- Warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication do not particularly suggest business administration, although they can be seen as relevant to any field.

Let's estimate the probabilities based on these qualitative alignments:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values are subjective estimates based on the given personality characteristics and their relevance to each field.
