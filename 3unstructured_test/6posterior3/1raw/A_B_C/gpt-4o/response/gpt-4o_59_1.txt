To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam’s personality sketch aligns with the demands and characteristics of each field. While specific data and prior probabilities for enrollment rates in each field would enhance the accuracy, in the absence of such data, we'll use qualitative reasoning based on the description provided.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest a strong alignment with this field. 
2. **Computer Science**: His intelligence, enjoyment in solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts are relevant to this field.
3. **Business Administration**: While his intelligence is a fit, the lack of traits like leadership, management, or interest in economics and business might suggest a weaker alignment.

Based on the personality traits, we can infer the following approximate posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect a qualitative assessment of how well Adam’s personality aligns with the key requirements and typical student characteristics in each field.
