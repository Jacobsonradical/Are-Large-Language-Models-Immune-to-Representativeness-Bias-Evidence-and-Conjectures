To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each specific field given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits align with the typical characteristics and interests required or common in each field. This qualitative assessment is somewhat subjective, but we can make reasonable approximations based on the provided details.

1. **Business Administration**: Adam's deep curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals do not particularly align with the traditional traits associated with Business Administration, which often include interests in finance, management, and organizational leadership. Although intelligence is valuable in any field, the specific characteristics highlighted in the sketch do not suggest a strong predisposition towards Business Administration.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for plants, empathy, and love for animals strongly align with a field like Agricultural and Veterinary Science. His personality traits perfectly match the typical interests and values found in individuals who pursue careers in these areas.

3. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, both of which are important skills in Computer Science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are less relevant to this field. While these traits do not preclude an interest in Computer Science, they suggest that his primary passions might lie elsewhere.

Given these considerations, the posterior conditional probabilities might be approximated as:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's personality sketch is most strongly aligned with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, followed by some alignment with Computer Science due to his puzzle-solving skills and abstract thinking. His traits are least aligned with Business Administration.
