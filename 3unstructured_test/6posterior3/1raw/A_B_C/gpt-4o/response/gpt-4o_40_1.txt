To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we need to consider the likelihood of Adam's personality traits aligning with each field. Given the sketch, we make certain heuristic assumptions to approximate these probabilities.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, suggesting a personality well-suited to this field. His empathy and warm heart might align well with veterinary science. 
2. **Business Administration**: Adam's quiet nature and preference for puzzles might not align as strongly with the traditionally sociable and leadership-oriented traits often associated with business administration.
3. **Computer Science**: His high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts are also well-suited for computer science.

Given these considerations, we can estimate the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.55,
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

This estimation reflects a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science followed by computer science, and a lower likelihood for business administration based on the provided personality sketch.
