To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for each field of study given Adam's personality sketch, I'll use Bayes' Theorem, which states that:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch given he is in a specific field.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a specific field.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of having Adam's personality sketch across all fields (a normalizing constant).

Given that we don't have specific values for \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \), we'll use our intuition for the likelihoods \( P(B | A) \) based on the personality traits described.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.7):**
   - **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Strongly relevant.
   - **Love for animals**: Strongly relevant.
   - **Empathy and warm heart**: Common in fields dealing with living creatures.
   - **Understanding of hard work and dedication**: Essential in this field.
   - Likelihood is high because his interests and traits align closely with this field.

2. **Business administration (0.1):**
   - **Empathy and warm heart**: Can be relevant in people-oriented business roles.
   - **Understanding abstract concepts**: Helpful in business strategies.
   - **Understanding of hard work and dedication**: Important in business.
   - Since the personality traits are not specific to business administration, the likelihood is lower.

3. **Computer science (0.4):**
   - **Intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: Highly relevant.
   - **Enjoyment in solving puzzles**: Common among computer science students.
   - **Quiet demeanor**: Common but not specific to computer science.
   - **Curiosity about nature**: Less directly relevant.
   - While some traits align well, others are less connected, hence the moderate likelihood.

These values reflect a subjective assessment based on the sketch provided.
