To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each specific field given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well Adam's traits match the typical profiles of students in those fields. We'll use Bayes' Theorem qualitatively, as we don't have precise prior probabilities or likelihoods.

Let's break down Adam's personality traits and see how they align with each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - Curiosity about nature and plants.
   - Warm heart and strong empathy.
   - Deep love for animals.
   - High intelligence.
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

2. **Computer Science**
   - Enjoys solving puzzles.
   - High intelligence.
   - Good at understanding abstract concepts.

3. **Business Administration**
   - High intelligence.
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work.

Given the information:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's love for nature and animals, combined with empathy and dedication, strongly align with this field.
- **Computer Science**: His intellect and passion for puzzles and abstract concepts fit well here, but there are fewer direct connections.
- **Business Administration**: While the traits of intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant, his strong empathy and love for animals/nature might be less directly related.

Given these qualitative matches, here's a rough estimation of the posterior probabilities on a scale from 0 to 1. 

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are a heuristic assessment based on the alignment between Adam's traits and the typical demands and culture of each field. The probabilities do not add up to 1, as you requested.
