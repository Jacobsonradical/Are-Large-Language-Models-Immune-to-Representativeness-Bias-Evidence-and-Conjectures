To determine the posterior conditional probability for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we can consider how well his characteristics align with each field. Although we do not have precise statistical data to make exact calculations, we can make informed estimates based on the provided information.

Adam has a love for nature, plants, animals, high intelligence, warm heart, empathy, and good skills in abstract concepts and hard work.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Very relevant.
- Deep love for animals: Highly relevant.
- Warm heart and empathy: Important for veterinary aspects involving animal care.
- Understanding and appreciation of hard work: Common in agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Given these alignments:
\[
\text{{"agricultural and veterinary science"}} = 0.8
\]

### Computer Science
- Solving puzzles: Relevant to programming and algorithms.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Very relevant.
- Empathy and love for animals: Not directly relevant.
- Curiosity about nature: Not directly relevant.

Given these alignments:
\[
\text{{"computer science"}} = 0.4
\]

### Business Administration
- High intelligence and appreciating hard work: Relevant.
- Solving puzzles: Relevant to problem-solving in business.
- Warm heart and empathy: Useful for leadership but not a primary focus.
- Curiosity about nature and love for animals: Not directly relevant.

Given these alignments:
\[
\text{{"business administration"}} = 0.3
\]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities, based on qualitative assessment, are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```
