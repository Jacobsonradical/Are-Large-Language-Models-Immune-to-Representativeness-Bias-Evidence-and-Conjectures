To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for each field, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities (\(P(Field)\)) and likelihoods (\(P(Personality | Field)\)) for each field, we cannot compute exact numerical posterior probabilities. Therefore, we'll reason qualitatively based on Adam's personality sketch.

Given Adam's interests and traits:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science** seems highly probable given his love for nature, plants, and animals.
- **Computer science** could be moderately probable due to his high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles.
- **Business administration** seems less likely given his traits do not directly relate to typical interests in that field.

Here is a plausible assignment of probabilities based on this qualitative analysis:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science due to his strong interests and attributes, a moderate likelihood for computer science, and a low likelihood for business administration based on the given personality sketch.
