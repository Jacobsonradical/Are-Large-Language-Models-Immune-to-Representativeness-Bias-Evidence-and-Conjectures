To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field based on his personality sketch, we would ordinarily use a Bayesian approach. However, without prior probabilities or likelihoods for these fields based on Adam's characteristics, an exact calculation isn't possible. Instead, I will make educated estimates based on the given information.

Given Adam's personality traits, such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work, it appears that some fields may align better with his interests and attributes than others.

1. **Business Administration**: While Adam might have the intelligence and appreciation for hard work required for this field, there is nothing specific in his sketch that indicates a particular interest in business. The curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals suggest his interests are likely oriented elsewhere.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field directly aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with the demands of this field. Therefore, this field seems to be a strong match given his personality.

3. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, both of which are essential skills in computer science. However, the absence of any specific mention of technology or coding in his sketch might suggest that while he could be good at it, it may not be his primary interest.

Based on these considerations, here's an educated estimation of the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

Again, note that these values are subjective estimates based on the given personality sketch and not precise calculations.
