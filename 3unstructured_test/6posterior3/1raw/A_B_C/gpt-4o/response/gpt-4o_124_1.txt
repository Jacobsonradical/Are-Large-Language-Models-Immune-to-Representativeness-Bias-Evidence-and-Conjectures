To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we must integrate information from Adam's personality sketch with our general understanding of the types of individuals typically enrolling in each mentioned field. The underlying foundation here relies on Bayesian reasoning; however, given the lack of precise prior statistics, the calculations will reflect qualitative assessments rather than exact numerical probabilities.

Firstly, let's analyze Adam's traits in relation to each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Personality traits such as empathy and understanding hard work are applicable here, but there's no strong indication that Adam is highly driven by business concerns such as market strategies or management principles.
   - His primary interests are in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts, which are less directly relevant to a business focus.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and his problem-solving ability align closely with this field.
   - Empathy and dedication are crucial traits in veterinary science, as caring for animals and understanding ecological systems form the core work.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and an affinity for solving puzzles suggest an aptitude for computing.
   - Understanding abstract concepts is critical in computer science; however, there is less direct indication of a specific interest in computing compared to his pronounced interest in nature.

Based on these assessments, here are the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being involved in agricultural and veterinary science due to the direct alignment of his interests and skills with this field. Computer science is credible based on his puzzle-solving and abstract thinking abilities, while business administration appears to be the least likely field given his personality sketch.
