To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of these graduate fields given his personality sketch, we'll consider the alignment of his personality traits with the general characteristics of students in these fields. 

1. **Business Administration**: This field typically attracts individuals with strong leadership, management, and organizational skills. While these traits are not explicitly mentioned in Adam's sketch, his intelligence and appreciation for hard work might fit somewhat with this field, but his warm heart and empathy don't strongly point towards this field. Therefore, the probability will be lower.

2. **Computer Science**: This field often requires strong analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, and an interest in abstract conceptsâ€”all of which are indicated in Adam's personality sketch. However, his strong empathy and love for animals are less typical of stereotypes for this field. Hence, the probability is moderate.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field directly aligns with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. His traits of empathy and warm heart also strongly point towards this field, therefore the probability will be higher.

Given these considerations, the estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These probabilities are not normalized to sum to 1 because we are considering just these three fields out of many possible graduate specializations.
