To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning.

Let's denote:
- P(A|C) as the probability of Adam being in field A given his personality sketch C.
- P(A) as the prior probability of being in field A.
- P(C|A) as the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch C given he is in field A.
- P(C) as the total probability of Adam having his personality sketch.

The formula for Bayes' Theorem is:
\[ P(A|C) = \frac{P(C|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(C)} \]

While we don't have explicit numerical values for these probabilities, we can reason through the relative likelihoods qualitatively based on the personality sketch provided.

Given Adam's profile, we have:
- A genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
- A quiet disposition, enjoys solving puzzles
- A warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's assess P(C|A) for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - A genuine curiosity about nature and plants fits well.
   - A deep love for animals aligns closely with veterinary science.
   - High empathy is important in working with animals.
   - Likely high P(C|A).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - The subjectâ€™s traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) do not align strongly with the typical focus of business administration.
   - Likely low P(C|A).

3. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts fit well.
   - Enjoying solving puzzles is a positive trait for problem-solving in computer science.
   - The love for nature and animals is not directly relevant.
   - Moderate P(C|A).

Based on these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Please note these values are based on qualitative reasoning and could vary with more specific data.
