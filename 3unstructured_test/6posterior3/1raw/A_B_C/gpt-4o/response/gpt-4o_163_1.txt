To determine the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning. This involves considering the likelihood of each personality trait given a specific field, combined with the general likeliness of each field. 

Given Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm heart and strong empathy.
- Deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and proficiency in abstract concepts.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Let's assess the likelihood of these traits mapping to each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Curiosity about nature/plants: High likelihood.
   - Love for animals: High likelihood.
   - Empathy and warm heart: Relevant due to animal care.
   - Intelligence and abstract thinking: Necessary for advanced research.
   - Hard work dedication: Required in both agriculture and veterinary fields.
   - Overall, this field aligns well with many of his personality traits.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Solving puzzles: Relevant for problem-solving in business scenarios.
   - Intelligence and abstract thinking: Relevant.
   - Hard work dedication: Very relevant due to the demanding nature of the field.
   - Other traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy): Less relevant.
   - This field aligns moderately with some traits but not others.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Solving puzzles: Highly relevant.
   - Intelligence and abstract thinking: Highly relevant.
   - Hard work dedication: Very relevant.
   - Other traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy): Less relevant.
   - This field aligns well with his critical thinking and puzzle-solving but less with traits related to nature and animals.

Given these considerations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** gets the highest likelihood (0.7) because Adam's traits align very well with the field.
- **Business Administration** has a lower likelihood (0.3) due to fewer aligning traits.
- **Computer Science** (0.4) fits reasonably well considering his problem-solving skills and intelligence but does not align as perfectly as Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
