To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields, we need to consider how well his personality traits align with the typical characteristics and requirements of each field. However, without actual empirical data or a detailed model of domain-specific traits, we can only make qualitative estimates based on his personality sketch.

Let's apply qualitative reasoning:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators for computer science.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles, which aligns well with problem-solving and analytical tasks in computer science.
   - His empathy and warm heart are less typical for a stereotype of computer science but not strictly contradictory.
   - Love for nature and animals is not particularly indicative of this field.
   
   These traits provide some alignment but are not exclusively determinative.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants is a strong indicator.
   - Deep love for animals directly aligns with veterinary science.
   - Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication is a key aspect of this field.
   - Intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are beneficial but less central.
   
   These traits are highly indicative of this field.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are relevant.
   - Empathy can be an asset in business for leadership and management roles.
   - However, there is less direct connection to his love for nature, animals, and his quieter disposition.
   
   These traits are somewhat indicative but less strongly aligned.

Based on these considerations, I would estimate the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These numbers reflect the qualitative alignment of Adam's personality traits with the characteristics common to each field, based on the provided sketch.
