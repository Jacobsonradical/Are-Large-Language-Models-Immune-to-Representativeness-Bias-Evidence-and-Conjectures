To compute the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields, we can use information from his personality sketch to estimate how well it aligns with each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication suggests a strong fit for this field. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also align well with the scientific nature of this field.
2. **Business Administration**: Adam’s personality sketch does not provide direct evidence of an interest or traits particularly relevant to business administration, such as a focus on management, economics, or organizational behavior.
3. **Computer Science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, there's no mention of specific interests in technology or computing, which somewhat weakens the case compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Using these assessments to update our prior probabilities based on how well Adam's traits match the requirements and typical interests of each field, we can estimate the values as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These values are rough estimates based on available qualitative information from Adam's personality sketch.
