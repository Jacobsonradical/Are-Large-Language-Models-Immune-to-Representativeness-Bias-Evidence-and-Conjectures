To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for each graduate field given Adam's personality sketch, we need to consider how well each field aligns with Adam's described traits. These probabilities are not calculated through exact numeric data but derived from qualitative judgment based on the provided information.

1. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - Curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving align well with CS.
   - Empathy and love for animals don't strongly correlate with typical CS traits.
   - Overall, CS fits some but not all aspects of Adam's personality.

2. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - Empathy and understanding abstract concepts can be relevant to BA.
   - The specific love for nature and animals, as well as puzzle-solving, are less relevant.
   - Overall, BA fits moderately but not strongly with Adam's personality.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**
   - Curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals strongly align with AVS.
   - Empathy and understanding hard work also support this field.
   - Overall, AVS fits very well with Adam's personality.

Given these considerations, we can estimate the posterior probabilities (note that this is qualitative and not numeric in the Bayesian sense):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Agricultural and Veterinary Science is given the highest probability due to the strong alignment with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and understanding of hard work. Computer Science is given a moderate probability because of his intelligence and problem-solving skills, but less alignment with his warmth and empathy. Business Administration is given the least probability due to a weaker correlation with his detailed traits.
