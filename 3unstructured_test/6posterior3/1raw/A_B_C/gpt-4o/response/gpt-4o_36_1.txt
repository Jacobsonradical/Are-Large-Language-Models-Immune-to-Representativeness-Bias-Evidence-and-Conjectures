To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning. However, without specific numerical data on the probabilities of different graduate fields (prior probabilities) or how well each field matches his personality traits (likelihoods), the computations will be based on qualitative reasoning and approximations.

Given Adam's interests and personality traits:
- A genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles (suggesting problem-solving skills)
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

We can make qualitative assessments of how likely he might be in each field.

### Computer Science
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence align well with computer science.
- Understanding abstract concepts is a key part of computer science.
- No specific indication of interest in technology or computers, which might be less emphasized compared to other fields based on his interests.

### Business Administration
- Traits like empathy and understanding hard work could be useful in business, especially in management roles.
- However, there is no specific mention of an interest in business, economics, or social interactions related to business.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Direct interest in nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests a fit for agricultural and veterinary science.
- Warm heart and empathy further align well with veterinary care and agricultural work, which often involve working with animals and understanding environmental impact.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns with the demanding nature of these fields.

Based on these assessments, I'd assign the following probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These values are derived from a qualitative assessment of the likelihood that Adam's specific interests and traits would lead him to each field, with a strong leaning towards agricultural and veterinary science due to the direct match with his stated affinities.
