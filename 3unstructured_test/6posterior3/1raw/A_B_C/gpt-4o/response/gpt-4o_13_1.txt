To estimate the posterior conditional probability of Adam's enrollment in each field given his personality sketch, we need to consider the match between his described characteristics and the typical traits associated with success and interest in each of these fields. This estimate will be a subjective assessment based on the given personality profile.

Given Adam's characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted with strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's break it down:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts match well.
   - Less emphasis on nature, plants, and animals in this field.
   - Empathy and warm-heartedness are less commonly highlighted traits for the field.
   
   Estimated probability: 0.2

2. **Business Administration**:
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are relevant.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication is important.
   - Less of a fit for the traits related to nature, animals, and empathy.
   
   Estimated probability: 0.1

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants fits excellently.
   - Deep love for animals is a strong fit.
   - High empathy and warm-heartedness are highly relevant.
   - Intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are necessary.
   
   Estimated probability: 0.7

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are based on the alignment of Adam's traits with typical characteristics and interests associated with each field, and are subjective estimates.
