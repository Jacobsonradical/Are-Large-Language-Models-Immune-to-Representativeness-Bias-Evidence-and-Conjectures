To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we'll consider how well his personality traits align with the typical traits and interests of students in each field. While we don't have specific probabilities, we can use qualitative reasoning based on his described characteristics.

1. **Business Administration**: Business administration programs typically attract students who are interested in leadership, management, economics, and entrepreneurship. While Adam is described as intelligent and appreciates hard work and dedication, his specific interests in nature, animals, and solving puzzles do not strongly align with the typical focus areas of business administration.

2. **Computer Science**: Computer science students often have a strong interest in abstract concepts, problem-solving, and puzzles, which aligns well with Adam's description. However, his deep love for nature and animals doesn't directly connect to this field, possibly reducing the alignment.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Agricultural and veterinary science programs attract students who are passionate about nature, plants, and animals, which is a perfect match for Adam's interests and empathy towards animals. Given his curiosity about nature and his understanding of hard work, this field seems to be the most likely given his personality sketch.

Based on these considerations, we can provide qualitative estimates of the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are subjective and based on how well his interests and personality align with each field, rather than precise statistical calculations.
