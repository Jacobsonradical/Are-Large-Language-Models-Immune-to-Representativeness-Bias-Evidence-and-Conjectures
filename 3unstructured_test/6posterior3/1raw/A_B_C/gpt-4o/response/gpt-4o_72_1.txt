To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, given the personality sketch of Adam, we can use a qualitative analysis based on the alignment of his traits with the typical characteristics associated with each field of study. It's important to note that this approach is inherently subjective as it isn't rooted in statistical data but rather an intuitive assessment based on the provided traits.

1. **Computer Science**: Adam’s high intelligence and skill in understanding abstract concepts align well with the requirements of computer science. His enjoyment of solving puzzles is another strong indicator that he could excel in this field. However, his deep empathy and love for animals are less related to this domain. 

2. **Business Administration**: While Adam’s strong empathy and understanding of hard work are useful in business administration, it is less directly related to his interest in nature, plants, and animals. The personality traits given do not strongly indicate an affinity for business environments or the kinds of interpersonal skills typically emphasized in this area.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field directly aligns with Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his empathy. Agricultural and veterinary science is a field that allows Adam to apply his high intelligence and appreciation for hard work in a context that closely matches his interests and passions.

Based on this qualitative analysis, here's the estimation:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

This estimation reflects a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science, given Adam’s personality traits and interests, followed by computer science due to his abstract thinking and problem-solving skills, and finally, business administration which seems the least aligned with his described characteristics.
