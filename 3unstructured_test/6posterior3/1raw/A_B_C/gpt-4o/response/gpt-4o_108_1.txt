To estimate the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each given field, given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning. Although we don't have specific base rates (priors) or likelihoods for exact calculations, we can still provide a qualitative estimation based on the description provided.

1. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles, is highly intelligent, and good at understanding abstract concepts, which are positive indicators for Computer Science. However, there is no specific mention of an interest in computers or technology.
  
2. **Business Administration**: This field often requires a focus on management, strategy, and finance, areas that are not specifically aligned with Adam's interests in nature, empathy, and animals. Adam's curiosity about nature and warm-hearted personality suggest that he may not be as interested in the competitive and strategic nature of business administration.
  
3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy. These traits are highly indicative of someone who would be drawn to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Based on this qualitative analysis, here is the posterior probability estimation:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect an estimation where Adam's personality sketch aligns most strongly with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, moderately with Computer Science due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills, and least likely with Business Administration.
