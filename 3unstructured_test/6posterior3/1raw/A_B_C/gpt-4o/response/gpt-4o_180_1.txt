To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to apply Bayesian reasoning considering Adam's personality characteristics and how likely they align with each field of study. 

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and capability in understanding abstract concepts favor this field, but his love for nature and animals, and his empathy, may not directly align with typical motivations for computer science, though they don't preclude it.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, this field fits well with his personality traits.

3. **Business Administration**: Adam's quiet nature and deep love for animals don't strongly suggest an inclination towards business administration, which often requires assertiveness and a focus on human-centric, commercial activities more than nature-centric ones.

Given the personality sketch and the typical characteristics of students in these fields, we can estimate the probabilities qualitatively:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These probabilities reflect that the personality traits described are most consistent with a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, followed by computer science, and least likely business administration.
