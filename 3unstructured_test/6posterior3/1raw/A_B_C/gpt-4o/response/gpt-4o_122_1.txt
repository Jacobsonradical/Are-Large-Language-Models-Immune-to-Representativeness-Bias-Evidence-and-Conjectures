To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields given his personality sketch, we can use intuition informed by his traits and interests. Although we cannot provide precise numerical probabilities without proper training data, we can make an educated guess based on the compatibility of his interests and personality with each field. Here's an estimation:

Adam shows a strong interest in nature, animals, and solving puzzles. He also values hard work and dedication. Let's consider each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns well with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. His empathy and warm heart are also highly compatible with a career involving animal care or agriculture.
2. **Business Administration**: This field seems less aligned with Adam's described traits. While it does require intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, it often involves less direct interaction with nature and animals, which are key interests for Adam.
3. **Computer Science**: His high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit well with the analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science. However, it doesn’t strongly align with his love for nature and animals, although his appreciation for hard work and dedication fits. 

Based on these considerations, our educated guesses for posterior conditional probabilities might be as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```
These values reflect the likelihood that Adam’s personality and interests would lead him to pursue each of these fields, given the traits outlined in the personality sketch.
