To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for each field, given Adam's personality sketch, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. While actual numeric probabilities require empirical data which isn't provided here, I can make a reasoned estimate based on the qualitative information given.

Given:
1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
3. He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
4. He appreciates hard work and dedication.
5. He was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.

Now let's reason through each field:

**Business Administration**:
- This field doesn't notably align with Adam's strong interest in nature, animals, and empathy.
- However, his high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- Strong alignment with his love for animals, curiosity about nature, and plants would make this field seem a very likely fit.
- High empathy and warm heart point strongly towards veterinary science.

**Computer Science**:
- While this field doesn't particularly align with his love for nature or animals, his intelligence and skill in abstract concepts fit well.
- Empathy and warm-heartedness are not typically associated with this field, though they do not exclude it.

Based on these qualitative assessments, the probabilities would be roughly:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

Here's the logic:
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Although Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant, his primary interests and traits are much less aligned.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: This field matches almost perfectly with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and warm-hearted nature.
- **Computer Science (0.2)**: While his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit this field, his core loves and empathy do not align perfectly.
