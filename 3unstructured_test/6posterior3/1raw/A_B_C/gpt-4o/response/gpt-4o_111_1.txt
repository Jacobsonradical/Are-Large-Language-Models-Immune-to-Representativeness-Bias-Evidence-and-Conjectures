To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we can consider the fit of Adam's personality traits with each field of study.

1. **Computer Science**: Common traits for computer science students often include a knack for problem-solving, high intelligence, and an understanding of abstract concepts. Adam demonstrates a strong fit here with his puzzle-solving ability and intelligence.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field requires a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, a love for animals, and empathy. Adam's traits align very well with this field, as he exhibits strong empathy, a love for animals, and curiosity about nature.

3. **Business Administration**: Business administration students often show traits such as leadership, strategic thinking, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. Adam does appreciate hard work and dedication, but he does not exhibit the predominant traits associated with business administration like leadership or strategic thinking in the provided sketch.

Given these alignments, the posterior probabilities might be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are estimates based on the qualitative alignment of Adam's traits with the typical characteristics of graduate students in each field.
