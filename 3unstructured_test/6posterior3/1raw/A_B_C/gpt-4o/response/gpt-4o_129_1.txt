To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the provided fields given his personality sketch, we should consider how well his interests and attributes align with the typical qualities associated with each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - His empathy and warm heart make him likely to care for living beings.
   Given his characteristics, it is highly probable that Adam would be interested in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Adam is intelligent and understands abstract concepts, which are useful in Business Administration.
   - However, his main interests are centered around nature, animals, and empathy, which are not strong indicators for a business administration field.
   - Therefore, it is less likely, though not impossible, that he would be enrolled in Business Administration.

3. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is intelligent, which suits the analytical nature of Computer Science.
   - However, his core interests are more aligned with nature and animals.
   - Thus, while his skills match, his passion appears to lie elsewhere.

Given these considerations, the posterior conditional probabilities might be as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These values indicate a higher probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to his strong alignment with interests in nature and animals. The probabilities are lower for Business Administration and Computer Science, reflecting a lesser alignment with his personal interests despite the relevance of his skills.
