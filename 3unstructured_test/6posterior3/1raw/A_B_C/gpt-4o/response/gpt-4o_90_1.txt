To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields given his personality sketch, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of A given B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of B.

Given the personality sketch and comparing it against the fields of study, we need to make reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods and distributions (priors and evidence) involved. However, without specific numerical values, we can make qualitative assessments based on typical traits associated with these fields.

### Likelihood and Prior Assumptions
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**
   - Likelihood (\( P(B|A_{AVS}) \)): Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals suggests a high likelihood.
   - Prior (\( P(A_{AVS}) \)): Although not the largest field, it's substantial in relevance to the traits described.

2. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - Likelihood (\( P(B|A_{BA}) \)): His empathy and understanding of hard work could be relevant, but he is quieter and more focused on puzzles and abstract concepts, which is less typical for a business administration personality.
   - Prior (\( P(A_{BA}) \)): It’s one of the larger fields, but the personality matches less strongly.

3. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - Likelihood (\( P(B|A_{CS}) \)): High intelligence, enjoyment in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science.
   - Prior (\( P(A_{CS}) \)): This field has a significant number of graduate students.

### Informed Estimation
Given these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect that while Adam's traits align strongly with computer science (0.7) and reasonably well with agricultural and veterinary science (0.6), they align less well with business administration (0.1). The numbers chosen are illustrative and meant to represent a relative sense of probability based on the personality traits and field characteristics.
