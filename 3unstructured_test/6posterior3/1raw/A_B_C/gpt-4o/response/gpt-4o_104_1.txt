To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields given his personality sketch, we use Bayes' theorem. Since we lack specific prior probabilities for each graduate field, we should base our answers on how well Adam's personality aligns with the characteristics typically associated with each field. This is a qualitative assessment and not exact science but should provide a reasonable approximation.

Adam's personality suggests a strong inclination toward nature, animals, curiosity, intelligence, empathy, and abstract thinking. Let's analyze how these traits match up with the typical characteristics of students in each field.

1. **Computer Science:** Students in computer science typically exhibit high intelligence and abstract thinking, which Adam possesses. However, thereâ€™s no specific mention of interest in technology or computing, which is crucial for this field.

2. **Business Administration:** This field often requires strong leadership, an understanding of business operations, and people skills. While Adam has empathy, his personality sketch does not strongly indicate a business inclination or interest in organizational behavior.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** This field is closely aligned with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his appreciation for hard work and dedication, making it a strong match for his interests and personality.

Given these considerations, the posterior conditional probabilities are estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These estimates reflect that Adam's personality traits most closely align with agricultural and veterinary science, followed by computer science, and least likely business administration based on the provided sketch.
