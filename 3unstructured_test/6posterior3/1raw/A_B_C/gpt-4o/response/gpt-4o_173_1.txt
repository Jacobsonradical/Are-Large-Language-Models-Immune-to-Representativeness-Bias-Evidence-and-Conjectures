To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we need to perform a Bayesian analysis. While I can't provide exact values without more detailed statistical data, I can provide a qualitative assessment based on the given information.

Here's a qualitative breakdown:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam is described as having a high intelligence and being good at understanding abstract concepts. He enjoys solving puzzles, which is a trait often associated with fields like computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for nature and animals might make this less likely compared to other fields more closely aligned with his interests. So, we should assign a moderately low probability.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This fits well with Adamâ€™s genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. This field directly aligns with multiple key aspects of his personality. Therefore, we can assign a high probability to this field.

3. **Business Administration**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be beneficial in business administration, the field does not align closely with his other interests, such as nature, plants, and animals. Thus, we should assign a low probability to this field.

Based on this qualitative analysis, here is the posterior probability in the requested format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Please note that these values are educated estimates based on the personality sketch provided. For more precise probabilities, detailed prior probabilities and likelihoods for each field would be needed.
