In order to compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. However, given that we don't have the prior probabilities for each field or the likelihood of a person with Adam's characteristics being enrolled in each field, we'll need to make a few educated guesses based on his personality sketch.

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( A \) given evidence \( B \).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( B \) given that hypothesis \( A \) is true.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( A \).
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability of evidence \( B \).

Given Adam's characteristics, let's consider the likelihood of his characteristics matching each field:

1. **Computer Science**: Curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts might align well, but less so with his empathy and love for animals.
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: His love for animals, curiosity about nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align very well.
3. **Business Administration**: High intelligence and appreciation for hard work might align, but his other characteristics are less indicative.

Based on these qualitative assessments, hereâ€™s an estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's characteristics are quite strongly aligned with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, moderately aligned with Computer Science, and least aligned with Business Administration.
