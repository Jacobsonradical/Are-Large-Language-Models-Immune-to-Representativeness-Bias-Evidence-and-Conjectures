To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayesian reasoning. We'll base our reasoning on how well Adam's characteristics align with typical students in each of the fields. This is a qualitative assessment, not a precise quantitative one, but it will give us a plausible range.

Adam's personality sketch suggests a strong affinity for understanding nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and abstract thinking align reasonably with computer science but less so with business administration, which often emphasizes different skill sets.

Now, we can roughly estimate the posterior probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70
}

- **Business Administration (0.05):** There is a low probability that Adam is studying business administration. His interests and skills do not strongly align with this field.
  
- **Computer Science (0.25):** There is a moderate probability he's studying computer science, given his intelligence, abstract thinking, and interest in solving puzzles. However, nothing in the personality sketch specifically highlights typical interests or activities associated with computer science.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.70):** This is the most likely field for Adam, given his affection for nature, plants, animals, and genuine curiosity for the natural world. His empathy and warm-hearted nature also fit well with the profile of someone in this field.

These values reflect a qualitative assessment based on the information provided; actual probabilities could vary based on additional context or data.
