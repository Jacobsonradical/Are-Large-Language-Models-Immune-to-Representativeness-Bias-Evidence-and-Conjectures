To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each given field based on his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, without precise numerical prior probabilities and likelihoods, the computation will necessarily involve some estimation based on the qualitative information provided.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He has high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Estimations:
1. **Business Administration:**
   - Traits like empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence are useful in business administration.
   - However, Adam's strong love for nature and animals, as well as his curiosity about plants, suggest a lower likelihood for this field.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Enjoying puzzles and being good at abstract thinking are strong indicators.
   - Curiosity about nature and love for animals are less directly related.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - His curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are strong indicators.

### Posterior Conditional Probabilities:

Based on this qualitative assessment:
- Business Administration: lower probability due to misalignment with primary interests and traits.
- Computer Science: moderate probability, primarily due to enjoyment of puzzles and abstract thinking.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: higher probability due to alignment with interests in nature, plants, and animals.

Given these considerations, the probabilities (using relative qualitative assessments) can be represented as:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
```

These values reflect the degree of alignment of Adamâ€™s personality sketch with each field, but they sum to more than 1, indicating they are relative and not absolute probabilities. The exact numerical posterior probabilities would require the prior probabilities of each field and the likelihoods of Adam's traits given those fields.
