To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we'd typically use Bayes' Theorem. However, given the limited data and qualitative nature of the information, I will provide an intuitive approximation based on Adam's personality sketch.

Here's what we know about Adam:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given this, let's analyze each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Strong alignment with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
   - Probability: High

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with an ability to understand abstract concepts.
   - Probability: Moderate

3. **Business Administration**:
   - There's less direct alignment with his personality traits here, though appreciation for hard work does fit. However, his other traits suggest a stronger alignment with science-oriented fields.
   - Probability: Low

Thus:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values are subjective probabilities based on the personality sketch provided.
