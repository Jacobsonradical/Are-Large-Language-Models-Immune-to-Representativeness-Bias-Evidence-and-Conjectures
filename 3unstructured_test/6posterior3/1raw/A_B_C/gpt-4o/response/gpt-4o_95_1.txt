To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we can make use of Bayesian inference. Given Adam's personality sketch, we need to consider how his characteristics align with typical traits for each field. While we don't have exact values or base rates, we can reason qualitatively based on the information provided.

### Reasoning:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Pros: High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts align with typical traits of computer science students.
   - Cons: No direct mention of interest or skills in computer science, nature and animals are less relevant.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Pros: Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could align with business principles.
   - Cons: Empathy and deep love for nature and animals are less directly related to business administration.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Pros: Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for dedication are highly relevant to this field.
   - Cons: None that stand out based on the personality description.
   
With this qualitative reasoning, we can make educated guesses for the posterior probabilities.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.2)**: Given Adam’s strengths in intelligence and abstract problem-solving, there is a reasonable chance he could be in computer science, but his interests in nature and animals do not directly support this.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Adam's characteristics largely do not align with typical traits of business students, especially given his strong empathy and love for nature.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's personality and interests strongly fit this field, suggesting a high likelihood he was enrolled in this area of study.
