To determine the posterior conditional probability for each field given Adam’s personality sketch, we employ Bayesian reasoning. The likelihood of Adam’s personality traits fitting within each field is evaluated qualitatively. Here are the probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
    - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
    - He has a deep love for animals.
    - These traits fit well with agricultural and veterinary sciences.

2. **Computer science**:
    - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence.
    - He is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are essential in computer science.
    - However, his strong empathy and love for animals are less directly relevant to this field.

3. **Business administration**:
    - Although Adam has strong empathy and a recognition for hard work and dedication, his specific interests in nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving aren’t as directly aligned with business administration.

Given this qualitative reasoning, here's an estimation of the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values are subjective estimates based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the typical demands and interests of each field.
