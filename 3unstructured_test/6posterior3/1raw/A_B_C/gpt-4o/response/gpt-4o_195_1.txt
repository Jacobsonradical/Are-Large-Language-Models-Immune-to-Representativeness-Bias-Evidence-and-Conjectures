To compute the posterior probabilities, we need to understand Adam's personality and how it aligns with typical traits and interests of students in the given fields. While we lack empirical data for detailed calculations, we can make reasoned estimates based on qualitative information.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, agricultural and veterinary science seems like a strong fit. His intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts might also align with computer science, particularly if he uses those skills to solve puzzles or understand complex algorithms. Business administration appears to be less aligned with his interests based on the provided sketch.

Let's assign values that reflect these qualitative assessments:

1. "agricultural and veterinary science" - This field strongly aligns with Adam's love for animals and nature.
2. "computer science" - This field aligns with his high intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities.
3. "business administration" - While not directly aligned, there could be a small probability if there's a special focus like environmental business practices.

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values are subjective estimations meant to reflect the information given in the personality sketch. Without more detailed empirical data or additional context, precise probabilities cannot be determined.
