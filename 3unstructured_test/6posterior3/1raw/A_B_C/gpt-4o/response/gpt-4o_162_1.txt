To compute the posterior conditional probabilities given Adam's personality sketch, we'll use Bayesian reasoning. However, precise numerical values for these probabilities would generally require specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, which we don't have. Therefore, I'll provide an estimation based on the qualitative fit between Adam's personality traits and the typical characteristics required or common in each field.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, it seems more likely that he would be drawn to a field closely related to nature and animals. Since Adam is also intelligent and enjoys solving puzzles, computer science and business administration could also be fields of interest, but to a lesser extent.

Here's a rough estimation of the posterior probabilities based on the qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

This estimation reflects a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science due to his love for animals and nature, while considering his intelligence and problem-solving skills could potentially fit computer science and, to a lesser extent, business administration.
