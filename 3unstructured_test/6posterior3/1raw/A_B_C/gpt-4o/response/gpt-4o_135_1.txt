To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayesian reasoning. We consider how well Adam's characteristics match typical profiles of students in each field. Though actual probabilities would require specific data, we can make an educated estimation based on common traits associated with each field.

Let's analyze the match between Adam's characteristics and each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - Deep love for animals.
   - Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - Befits this field plausibly.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence.
   - Good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles.
   - Quiet demeanor.
   - Some overlap, especially regarding problem-solving and abstract thinking.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Requires strong leadership, communication skills, and an interest in organizational dynamics.
   - Less directly reflected in his personality sketch.
   - Less likely based on provided traits.

Given these considerations, we can assign approximate values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values suggest that Adam is most likely enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science due to the alignment of his personality traits with the typical requirements and interests of that field. Computer science comes next because of his intelligence and problem-solving skills, though it is a less direct match with his love of nature and animals. Business administration is the least likely given the lack of strong correlation with his described attributes.
