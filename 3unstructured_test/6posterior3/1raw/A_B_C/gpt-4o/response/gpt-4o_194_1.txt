To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, we want to update the probability that Adam is enrolled in one of the three given fields based on his personality sketch.

However, to provide concrete numbers, I would need specific base rates (prior probabilities) for each field along with information about how typical Adam's personality is for each field. Since we don't have this detailed information, I will give a plausible estimate based on his personality traits:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence, good at abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

Given these traits, let's make some reasonable assumptions:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: His curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy align strongly with this field.
2. **Business Administration**: His traits are less typical for this field. While intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant, the empathy and love for animals don't directly map to business administration.
3. **Computer Science**: His enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence fit well, and his quiet nature could align with the work environment. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature are less typical for this field.

Based on these considerations, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.60,
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "computer science": 0.30
}
```

These values are qualitative estimates. In a real-world scenario, you would require empirical data to make precise calculations.
