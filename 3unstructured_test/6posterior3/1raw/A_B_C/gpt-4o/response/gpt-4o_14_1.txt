To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam's field of study, we can utilize the given personality sketch and assess the likelihood that each field matches his characteristics. Specifically, we need to consider how typical each field is given Adam's identified traits such as intelligence, empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature and puzzles.

Let's evaluate the likelihood based on Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Interest in nature and puzzles: Generally low relevance.
   - Empathy: Can be relevant, especially in human resources or management.
   - Love for animals: Generally low relevance.
   - Understanding abstract concepts and intelligence: This could be relevant in strategy and economics, but less so than in other fields.

   Given these considerations, the match seems weak.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Interest in nature and plants: Very relevant.
   - Empathy and love for animals: Directly relevant.
   - Understanding abstract concepts and intelligence: Relevant, especially in scientific research and problem-solving in this field.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Very relevant in this labor-intensive and research-oriented field.

   This field matches very strongly with Adam's personality.

3. **Computer Science:**
   - Interest in puzzles and abstract concepts: Highly relevant.
   - Intelligence: Very relevant.
   - Empathy and love for animals: Generally less relevant.
   - Interest in nature: Generally less relevant unless focused on fields like bioinformatics or environmental modeling.

   The match here is moderate in terms of Adam's intellectual traits and puzzle-solving skills.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

- "business administration": 0.1 - Weak match given most characteristics.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8 - Very strong match with nature interest, empathy, and love for animals.
- "computer science": 0.4 - Moderate match due to logical thinking, abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving abilities.
