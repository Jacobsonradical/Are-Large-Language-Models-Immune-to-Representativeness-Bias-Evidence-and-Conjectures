To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields given his personality sketch, we need to evaluate how well his characteristics align with the typical attributes and interests of students in each field. This type of reasoning is often used in Bayesian inference, although without specific base rates, we'll make qualitative judgments based on provided information.

Here's an analysis of Adam's traits relative to each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts fit well with the demands of computer science.
    - Enjoyment of solving puzzles is also aligned with computer science problems.
    - Lesser direct relevance to his "warm heart, strong empathy" and "deep love for animals," though these do not preclude him from being in this field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - A genuine curiosity about nature and various plants aligns strongly with agricultural science.
    - A deep love for animals is a strong indicator for veterinary science.
    - Warm heart and strong empathy also align well, given that these fields often involve caring for living beings.

3. **Business Administration**:
    - This field typically requires strategic thinking and sometimes working with abstract concepts.
    - However, Adam's strong empathy, curiosity about nature and animals, and preference for quiet activities like puzzles don't strongly align with the typical high-energy, people-focused nature of business administration roles.

Based on this qualitative analysis:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These values reflect that Adam's personality sketch is most strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science, moderately aligned with computer science, and least aligned with business administration.
