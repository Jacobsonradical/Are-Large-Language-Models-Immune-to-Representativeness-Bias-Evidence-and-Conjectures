To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in one of the specified fields given his personality sketch, we can informally use Bayes' theorem and our understanding of Adam's attributes and how they match each field's typical student profile.

**For agricultural and veterinary science:**
- Adam shows a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, a deep love for animals, empathy, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. These attributes strongly align with this field.

**For business administration:**
- Adam's personality sketch emphasizes traits like empathy, problem-solving, and abstract thinking; however, there is no mention of interest in business practices, economics, or management, which are key facets of this field.

**For computer science:**
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits are relevant to computer science, but a specific mention of programming or technology interests is absent.

Given these considerations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

In this assessment:
- Agricultural and veterinary science has the highest probability due to Adam's strong alignment with nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work.
- Computer science has a moderate probability because of Adam's abstract thinking and puzzle-solving traits.
- Business administration has a low probability due to an evident lack of direct traits aligned with business interests.
