To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, because we don't have specific numerical priors (base rates) for each field, this exercise will be more qualitative and depend on the alignment between Adam's personality and the typical characteristics of each field of study.

Let's break down the qualities and match them with the fields:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - High intelligence
    - Good at understanding abstract concepts
    - Enjoys solving puzzles

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
    - Strong empathy
    - Deep love for animals
    - Warm heart

3. **Business Administration**:
    - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

Based on this qualitative assessment:

### Computer Science
Adam's intelligence, abstract thinking, and enjoyment of puzzles fit well with this field. However, this field might not align perfectly with his empathy or love for animals.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
This field aligns strongly with Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals. The traits match very well here.

### Business Administration
Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns well with this field, but the other aspects of his personality, such as his empathy and love for animals, do not align as well.

Given these analyses, here is an approximate qualitative posterior probability distribution:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Please note that these numbers are approximations based on qualitative assessments and assumptions, and the actual probabilities would require more specific data.
