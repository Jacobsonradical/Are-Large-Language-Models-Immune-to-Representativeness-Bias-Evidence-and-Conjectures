To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, since we don't have prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field, we will rely heavily on qualitative assessment based on how well his personality and characteristics match each field. The more closely his attributes align with the typical traits and requirements of a field, the higher the probability.

Let's analyze Adam's attributes in relation to each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are strong indicators that he may be inclined towards this field. His empathy and warm heart align well with veterinary science.

2. **Business Administration:** Adam's personality sketch does not particularly highlight traits typically associated with business administration, such as strong leadership skills, risk-taking, or a keen interest in business operations. Instead, he seems more scientifically inclined.

3. **Computer Science:** Adam enjoys solving puzzles and possesses high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are crucial in computer science. However, his strong inclination towards nature and empathy might not align as well with the solitary and logical nature of computer science, although it's still a possibility given his problem-solving skills.

Based on these assessments, we can assign posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect the qualitative fit of Adam's personality to each field, with a higher likelihood in agricultural and veterinary science due to his love for nature and animals, a moderate likelihood in computer science due to his problem-solving skills and intelligence, and a lower likelihood in business administration due to lesser alignment with his described traits.
