Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood of him being enrolled in different fields of study. We consider his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation of hard work.

### Reasoning:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - High probability: Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals are strong indicators that he might be drawn to a field where he can further explore these interests.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Low probability: While his intelligence and appreciation for hard work could be assets in business administration, there aren't any specific indicators in his personality sketch pointing directly to a business focus.

3. **Computer Science:**
   - Moderate probability: His enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence suggest that he might have an affinity for the abstract and problem-solving nature of computer science. However, his interests seem more aligned with nature and animals.

Given these considerations, we can assign the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "computer science": 0.30
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, a moderate possibility of being in computer science, and a lower probability of being in business administration.
