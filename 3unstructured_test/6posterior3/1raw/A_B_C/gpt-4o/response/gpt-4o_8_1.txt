To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to use Bayes' theorem along with our prior understanding and knowledge of the characteristics that align well with each field. However, given the summary nature of personality sketches, this won't be an exact science, and we'll be making some educated estimates.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field. Graduate students in this field often have a deep appreciation for nature, animals, and a genuine interest in biological sciences.
2. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits are crucial in computer science, which involves significant problem-solving and abstract thinking.
3. **Business Administration**: While Adam has high intelligence and an understanding and appreciation for hard work, there is less direct evidence in the personality sketch pointing to interests typically aligned with business administration, such as leadership, management, and economics.

Given these considerations, the estimated probabilities might look like this:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These numbers are not rigorously derived but are educated estimates based on the alignment of Adam's traits with the demands and common traits of each field.
