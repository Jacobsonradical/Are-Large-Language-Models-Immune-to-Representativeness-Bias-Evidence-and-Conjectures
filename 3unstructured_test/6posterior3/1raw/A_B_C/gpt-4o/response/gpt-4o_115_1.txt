To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the given fields based on his personality sketch, it is necessary to consider how well his attributes align with the typical characteristics and interests of students in those fields.

Given:
1. **Business Administration**: Typically attracts individuals interested in leadership, management, finance, and entrepreneurship. Personality traits often include strong communication skills, leadership abilities, and a focus on organizational behavior and economics.
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Attracts individuals with an interest in nature, animals, and plants, as well as a desire to understand and improve agricultural practices or animal health. Typically involves a strong understanding of biology and ecology, paired with a focus on hands-on, practical applications in agriculture or animal care.
3. **Computer Science**: Draws individuals who enjoy problem-solving, abstract thinking, and working with technology. Characteristics often include an interest in algorithms, programming, data structures, and computational theory.

Given Adam's personality:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, which strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
- His enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science.
- While he appreciates hard work and dedication, there is no specific mention of interests typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, management, or organizational behavior.

Based on this analysis, the posterior probabilities can be estimated subjectively as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the stronger alignment of Adam's personality traits with agricultural and veterinary science and computer science compared to business administration.
