To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits align with typical characteristics of students in each of the fields. 

Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, along with his appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is plausible that he might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His warm heart and strong empathy also support this field, as individuals in this domain often work closely with living beings and ecosystems.

Business administration typically requires strong social and leadership skills, which are not explicitly mentioned in Adam's personality sketch. Hence, it is less likely that he is enrolled in this field.

Computer science aligns with Adam's intelligence and capability of understanding abstract concepts. While his curiosity about nature and empathy are less directly related, the problem-solving aspect resonates with this field.

Based on this analysis, I estimate the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These probabilities reflect the alignment between Adam's personality traits and the typical requirements or characteristics of each graduate field.
