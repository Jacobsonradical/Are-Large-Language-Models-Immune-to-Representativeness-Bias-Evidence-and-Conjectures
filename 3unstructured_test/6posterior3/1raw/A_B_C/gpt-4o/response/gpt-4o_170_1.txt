To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' theorem. However, due to the lack of specific data on prior probabilities and likelihoods, I'll make reasoned estimates based on typical correlations between personality traits and fields of study.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, he aligns more closely with fields that involve nature, animals, and abstract thinking.

Here's the estimated posterior conditional probability for each field of specialization:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Computer Science (0.2):**
   - Although Adam has high intelligence and likes solving puzzles, which are relevant traits for computer science, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature make this field less likely.

2. **Business Administration (0.1):**
   - This field typically requires a strong interest in economics, management, and interpersonal skills in a business context. Adamâ€™s traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work are somewhat relevant, but his strong inclination toward nature and animals makes this field less likely.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**
   - This is the most probable field given Adam's personality. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align very well with this field. Agricultural and veterinary science also involves understanding the hard work in farming and animal care, which Adam appreciates.

These estimates are based on qualitative reasoning rather than precise calculations, but they provide a reasonable reflection of how Adam's personality traits align with these fields of study.
