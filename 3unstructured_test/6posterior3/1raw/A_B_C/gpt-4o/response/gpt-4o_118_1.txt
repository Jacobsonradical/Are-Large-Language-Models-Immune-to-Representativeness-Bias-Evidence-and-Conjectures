To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields given his personality sketch, we need to consider how each aspect of his personality aligns with typical characteristics or interests in these fields. This will require a mix of subjective judgment and understanding of how personality traits might map to different academic disciplines. 

Given Adam's characteristics such as curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence, we can derive plausible probabilities for each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, along with a deep love for animals and empathy, this field seems like a natural fit. It aligns well with multiple aspects of his personality.

   Probability: 0.65

2. **Business Administration:** While Adam is of high intelligence and understands hard work, this field is less about natural curiosity and empathy and more about leadership, strategy, and management skills. Adam's personality does not strongly align with typical personality traits for business administration students.

   Probability: 0.10

3. **Computer Science:** Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are valuable skills in computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for nature and animals are less typically associated with this field.

   Probability: 0.25

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
