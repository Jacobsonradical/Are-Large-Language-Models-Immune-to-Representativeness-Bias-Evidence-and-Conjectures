To compute the posterior conditional probability for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we need to reason about how likely his personality traits align with each field of study. Here's the reasoning for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adamâ€™s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work align closely with this field.
   - Students interested in this field often have a passion for nature and animals, making it a strong match.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence, which are traits commonly found in computer science students.
   - However, his love for nature and animals is not as directly relevant to computer science, which might make it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science but still plausible.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Although business administration requires intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, Adam's personality sketch does not provide strong indicators for an interest in business.
   - Lack of specific traits related to business and a strong alignment with other fields makes this less likely.

Given these considerations, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
