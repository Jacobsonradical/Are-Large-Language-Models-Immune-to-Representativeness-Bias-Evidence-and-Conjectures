To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality traits align with the typical requirements and nature of each field. Given that this is a qualitative assessment rather than a data-driven one, the probabilities are based on logical inferences from his personality traits.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - This field typically requires a strong interest in economics, management, and often involves less interaction with nature and animals. While intelligence and abstract thinking are beneficial, Adam's deep love for animals and nature along with his empathy suggest a lower alignment with this field.
   - Probability: **0.1** (low, but not impossible)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - This field directly relates to Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals. His empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are strong indicators that align well with the demands and dedication required in this field.
   - Probability: **0.7** (high)

3. **Computer Science:**
   - This field requires high intelligence and a strong ability to solve puzzles and understand abstract concepts, all of which align well with Adamâ€™s traits. Although his empathy and love for animals might not directly relate to this field, the technical skillset required fits well with his problem-solving abilities.
   - Probability: **0.4** (moderate)

Here is the formatted answer:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These probabilities reflect the qualitative assessment of how well Adam's personality traits align with the requirements and nature of each field.
