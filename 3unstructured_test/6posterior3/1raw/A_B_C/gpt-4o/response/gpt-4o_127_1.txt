To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields given his personality sketch, we need to consider how his traits align with typical characteristics associated with each field. 

Since we do not have precise prior probabilities or specific data on the proportion of students in each field with his traits, this is a qualitative assessment based on the given personality traits and how they typically align with each field. Here's the assessment:

1. **Business Administration**: This field often attracts individuals who are outgoing, interested in leadership, management, and economic systems. Given Adam's quiet nature, love for animals, and appreciation for nature, business administration seems less likely. 
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns very well with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. These traits are highly relevant in fields that involve working with plants and animals.

3. **Computer Science**: This field attracts individuals who are good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, traits that Adam possesses. However, given Adam's other traits which align more closely with a deep love for nature and animals, it seems less probable compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these qualitative assessments:
   
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science, a moderate likelihood for computer science, and a low likelihood for business administration, based on the alignment of his personality traits with the general characteristics of these fields.
