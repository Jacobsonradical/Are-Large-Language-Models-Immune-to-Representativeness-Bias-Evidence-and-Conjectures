To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, without exact prior probabilities and considering the subjective nature of the problem, we will make some assumptions based on the described personality traits and how they align with typical characteristics of students within these fields.

Here's an assessment:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals. These traits are generally less associated with business administration, which often involves a focus on finance, management, marketing, and organizational behavior. 
   - However, his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could fit well in business analytics or strategic decision-making.
   - Given the above, the probability is relatively low for business administration but not zero.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - His enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, especially regarding abstract concepts, align well with computer science.
   - However, there is no indication of interest in technology or programming, which are central to this field. 
   - This puts the probability in a moderate range.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align very well with this field.
   - His personality traits closely match those of individuals typically involved in agricultural and veterinary sciences, making this the most probable field.

Taking these points into account, here is the estimated posterior conditional probability distribution for Adam's field of enrollment:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These probabilities are subjective estimates based on the described personality traits and how they align with each field.
