To compute the posterior conditional probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each of the fields, we'll rely on our understanding of Bayesian reasoning. While we do not have exact numerical data to work with, we can provide qualitative probabilities based on how well Adam's described personality matches the typical interests and traits of students in each field.

Based on the given personality sketch, we can consider the following factors:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Let's analyze each field:

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - Relevant traits: Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, good with abstract concepts. These are strong indicators for Computer Science.
   - Irrelevant traits: Curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy for animals. These do not directly align with typical Computer Science fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Relevant traits: Genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, warm heart, strong empathy. These are highly indicative of a field in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Relevant traits: Appreciation for hard work and dedication. This trait fits well.
   - Irrelevant traits: Curiosity about nature and plants, interest in animals, solving puzzles, high intelligence aligned with abstract concepts. These do not strongly correlate with Business Administration.

Given Adam's personality sketch, we can provide the following non-numeric probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Please note that these values are qualitative estimates and actual posterior probabilities would require a more detailed statistical analysis with real-world data.
