To compute the posterior probabilities for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning. However, without explicit base rates and likelihoods for each of these fields, we'll have to make some educated guesses based on the personality traits described. Hereâ€™s how the traits might align with each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: aligns well with algorithmic thinking and coding.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: aligns well with theoretical aspects of computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - While high intelligence is relevant, the described personality sketch lacks the typical extroverted, leadership, and entrepreneurial traits often seen in business administration.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - Deep love for animals.
   - Strong empathy and warm heart.

Given these alignments, we can qualitatively assess the posterior probabilities. Note that these are subjective and based on the personality sketch provided.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

This assessment suggests that Adam is most likely enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science given his personality traits, with Computer Science being less likely but still plausible, and Business Administration being the least likely.
