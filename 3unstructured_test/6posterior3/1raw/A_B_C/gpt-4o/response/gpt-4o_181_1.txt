To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, it's important to note that the exact probabilities depend on various factors and statistical data that aren't provided here. Hence, the following answers will be based on a qualitative assessment of how well Adam's personality matches each field described in the provided sketch.

Here is an estimation of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

### Reasoning:

**Computer Science:**
- Curiosity about nature and solving puzzles align with the analytical and problem-solving skills required in computer science. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts also match well.
- However, there is no specific mention of an interest in technology or computing, which are critical to this field.
  - Estimated Probability: 0.25

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Adam's curiosity about nature and plants fits very well with this field. His warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals strongly suggest a good fit.
- His appreciation for hard work and dedication is also highly relevant in agricultural and veterinary science due to the demands of the field.
  - Estimated Probability: 0.6

**Business Administration:**
- The personality sketch does not directly reflect traits commonly associated with business administration, such as a strong interest in economics, management, or finance.
- While high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are beneficial, the empathy and love for animals are less relevant here.
  - Estimated Probability: 0.15

These probabilities are subjective and based on a qualitative match between Adam's personality traits and the typical demands and characteristics of each field. Actual probabilities would require detailed statistical data on the prevalence and correlation of such personality traits within each field.
