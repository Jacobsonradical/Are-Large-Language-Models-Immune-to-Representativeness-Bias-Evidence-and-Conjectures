To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields based on his personality sketch, let's consider how well his traits align with each field.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits are strongly associated with computer science.
   - However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and interest in nature and plants are not typically characteristic of a computer science student.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Business administration may require an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which Adam has.
   - However, his deep love for nature, animals, and puzzles, and his quiet personality do not strongly align with the typical attributes for business administration.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, love for animals, and empathy align very well with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - The traits mentioned in his sketch strongly suggest a fit for someone interested in this field.

Given these considerations, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These calculated probabilities reflect the degree to which Adam's personality traits align with each field of study.
