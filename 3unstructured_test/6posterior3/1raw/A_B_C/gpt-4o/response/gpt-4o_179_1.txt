To compute posterior conditional probabilities for Adam's enrollment in each field given his personality sketch, we need to informally consider which characteristics align well with typical profiles seen in each field.

Let's break it down based on the provided personality sketch:

1. **Curiosity about nature and plants** and **love for animals** strongly point toward Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
2. Interest in **solving puzzles**, **high intelligence**, and understanding of **abstract concepts** are often associated with fields like Computer Science.
3. The personality sketch does not provide specific traits commonly associated with Business Administration, i.e., focus on leadership, management, finance, or entrepreneurship.

Given these considerations, we can propose the following probabilities:

- **Computer Science**: While certain aspects like intelligence and abstract thinking fit, Adam's other interests lean towards different fields.
- **Business Administration**: This seems to be the least likely given the lack of relevant traits in the sketch.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: His curiosity about nature and love for animals make this the most likely field.

Here is an illustrative way to express these probabilities based on the traits provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70
}
```

These numbers are not calculated using precise statistical methods or specific frequency data from graduate study enrollments but are based on evaluating fit with the personality traits mentioned in the sketch.
