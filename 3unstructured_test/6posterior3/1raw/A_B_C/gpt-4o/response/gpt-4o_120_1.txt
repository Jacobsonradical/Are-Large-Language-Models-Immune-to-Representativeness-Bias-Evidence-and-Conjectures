To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we are essentially evaluating how well Adam's personality traits align with the typical characteristics and interests of students in each of the given fields. We are informed by how his traits match known trends in these areas. The actual computation of these probabilities requires a statistical model and data that we do not currently have, but given the qualitative information provided, we can still make educated estimates. 

Here’s an estimation based on Adam’s personality traits:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - Strong affinity for nature and plants
   - Love for animals
   - High empathy and warm heart
   - High probability due to consistent interest in nature and animals

2. Business Administration:
   - Focus on empathy might be useful in certain aspects like leadership or management
   - However, less direct mention of business-related interests
   - Lower probability as personality traits do not strongly align with typical business administration interests

3. Computer Science:
   - Good at understanding abstract concepts
   - Enjoys solving puzzles
   - High intelligence
   - Moderate probability due to alignment with problem-solving and abstract thinking

Here is the probability breakdown:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "computer science": 0.60
}
```

These are rough estimates based on qualitative alignment between Adam's personality traits and what is typically valued or required in these fields. Agricultural and Veterinary Science stands out as a strong match due to his deep love for nature and animals. Computer Science is also a good match due to his intelligence and love for puzzles, while Business Administration seems less likely based on the given personality sketch.
