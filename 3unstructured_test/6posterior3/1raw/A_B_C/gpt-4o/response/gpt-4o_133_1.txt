To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields based on his personality sketch, we can use a Bayesian approach. However, without precise prior probabilities and likelihoods from data, we have to rely on the qualitative description to make an educated guess. 

Here's the reasoning:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field. Given his described traits, it would be likely that he is enrolled in this field.
2. **Computer Science:** His enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence in abstract concepts makes this field seem plausible but not as strongly indicated as Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
3. **Business Administration:** There is little in the description that directly points to an interest in business, making this the least likely option among the three.

Given these observations, the posterior probabilities can be assigned as follows, keeping the values qualitative:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values represent the probabilities based on the given sketch and without further detailed statistical data. They do not add up to 1 as there could be fields beyond those listed that Adam's interests align with.
