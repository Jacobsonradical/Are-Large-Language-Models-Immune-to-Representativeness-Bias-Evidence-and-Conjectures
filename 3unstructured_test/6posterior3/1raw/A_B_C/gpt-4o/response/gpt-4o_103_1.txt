Given Adam's personality sketch, we can analyze how well each field of study aligns with his traits to estimate the posterior conditional probability. Here are my estimates:

1. *Computer Science:* Adam exhibits traits of high intelligence and an affinity for solving puzzles, both of which are conducive to success in computer science. However, his interest in nature and animals is less aligned with this field.
2. *Agricultural and Veterinary Science:* Adam's curiosity about nature and his deep love for animals make this field seem like a natural fit. His strong empathy and appreciation for dedication further align with careers in agriculture and veterinary sciences, where such traits are highly beneficial.
3. *Business Administration:* This seems less aligned with Adam's personality sketch. While intelligence and puzzle-solving can be beneficial in business, his core interests appear to lie more in nature and empathy-driven fields rather than in the profit-centric focus of business administration.

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities might look something like this:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
