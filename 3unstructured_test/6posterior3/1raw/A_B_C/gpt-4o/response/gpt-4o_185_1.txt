To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities, we'll use Bayes' theorem qualitatively, considering how well each field matches Adam's personality sketch. 

- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality traits like a deep love for nature, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work may not align closely with the typical characteristics often associated with business studies, which often emphasize leadership, strategic thinking, and business acumen.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with the demands of computer science, which often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking. However, his strong empathy and love for nature are not direct indicators for this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are strong indicators for this field.

Based on these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

- **Business Administration**: 0.1 (least likely based on the personality traits described)
- **Computer Science**: 0.3 (possible, given the intellectual traits but less alignment with other personal interests)
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 0.8 (most likely based on his interests and empathy)
