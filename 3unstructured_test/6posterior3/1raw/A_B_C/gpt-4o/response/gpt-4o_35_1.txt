To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities, we assume we lack complete information about typical student distributions and base rates across different fields, which would normally require extensive statistical data. However, we can still make a reasonable estimation based on Bayesian reasoning.

Given Adam's personality traits, we can qualitatively evaluate the likelihood of each field:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's deep interest in nature, plants, and animals strongly aligns with this field.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's love for solving puzzles and high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science.
- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality doesn't strongly indicate an inclination towards business or administrative tasks; this doesn't mean he couldn't be interested in this field, just that his described characteristics don't strongly support it.

Here's the posterior conditional probability distribution:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect the extent to which Adam's personality aligns with each field based on qualitative reasoning.
