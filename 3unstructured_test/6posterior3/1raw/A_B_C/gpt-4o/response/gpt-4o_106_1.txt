To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each given field, we would ideally use Bayesian inference. However, since we don't have specific base rates (priors) or likelihoods (the probability of a trait given a field) for each field, I'll provide a qualitative estimation based on the provided personality sketch.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adamâ€™s genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and appreciation for hard work significantly align with this field.
2. **Business Administration**: While his traits like high intelligence are valuable, his core interests (plants, animals, puzzles) don't strongly suggest a direct connection to typical business administration attributes.
3. **Computer Science**: His quiet nature and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with common attributes among computer science students, but there's less direct indication of an interest in the abstract concepts of computing in his personality sketch.

Using this qualitative reasoning:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
