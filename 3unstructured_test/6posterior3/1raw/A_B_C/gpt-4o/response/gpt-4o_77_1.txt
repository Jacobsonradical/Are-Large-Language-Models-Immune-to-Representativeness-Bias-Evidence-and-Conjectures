To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider both the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given each field and the prior probability of a graduate student enrolling in each field. 

While I don't have specific prior probability data (e.g., percentage of graduate students in each of these fields), I can provide a qualitative assessment based on Adam's detailed personality traits and how well they match typical attributes and interests related to each field.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, warm heart, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, we can qualitatively assess as follows:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Relevance of Adam's interest in nature/plants: Low
   - Relevance of Adam's love for animals: Low
   - Relevance of Adam's empathy: Moderate (can fit into UI/UX)
   - Overall match with personality sketch: Moderate for problem-solving, less for other attributes.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Relevance of Adam's interest in nature/plants: High
   - Relevance of Adam's love for animals: High
   - Relevance of Adam's empathy: High (important in veterinary work)
   - Overall match with personality sketch: High

3. **Business Administration:**
   - Relevance of Adam's interest in nature/plants: Low
   - Relevance of Adam's love for animals: Low
   - Relevance of Adam's empathy: Moderate (management roles could benefit from empathy)
   - Overall match with personality sketch: Moderate

Based on this qualitative assessment, here are the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values indicate that given Adam's personality traits, he is most likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, less likely in Computer Science, and least likely in Business Administration. Please note, this is a qualitative and subjective assessment due to the lack of specific numerical prior probability data.
