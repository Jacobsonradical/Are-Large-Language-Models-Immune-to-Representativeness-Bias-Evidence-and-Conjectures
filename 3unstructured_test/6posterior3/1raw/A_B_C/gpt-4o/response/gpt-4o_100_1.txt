To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each specific field given his personality sketch, we'll consider how well each field aligns with the various aspects of his personality and interests.

1. Business Administration:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, is empathetic, loves animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication. These traits do not strongly align with the typical interests and skills of someone in business administration. This field often involves people-oriented tasks, financial analysis, management skills, and strategic planning, which may not be as closely related to Adam's described interests and traits.

   Probability: low

2. Computer Science:
   - Adam is good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoys solving puzzles, both of which are strong indicators of an aptitude for computer science. However, while empathy, a love for animals, and a curiosity about nature may be beneficial in some areas of computer science (e.g., bioinformatics, environmental modeling), they are not the core focus of the field.

   Probability: moderate

3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, deep love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align very well with this field. Agricultural and veterinary science involves a strong connection with nature and animals, as well as the need for dedicated and empathetic individuals.

   Probability: high

Based on these considerations, the posterior conditional probabilities would be as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
