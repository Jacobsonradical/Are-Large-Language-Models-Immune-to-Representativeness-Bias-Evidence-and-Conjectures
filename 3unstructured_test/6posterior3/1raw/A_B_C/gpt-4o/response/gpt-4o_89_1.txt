To compute the posterior conditional probabilities given Adam's personality sketch, we need to consider which field is most likely to align with his interests, skills, and traits. These are Bayesian priors based on the given information about his personality.

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He possesses high intelligence and understands abstract concepts well.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Now let's evaluate the fit of Adam's personality with each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Positives:
     - Enjoys solving puzzles.
     - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
   - Negatives:
     - Less focus on nature, plants, and animals.
     - May not fully align with strong empathy and love for animals.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Positives:
     - Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - Negatives:
     - Less apparent connection to his interest in nature, plants, and animals.
     - May not fully utilize his curiosity about nature and strong empathy.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Positives:
     - Direct alignment with curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals.
     - Likely to involve empathy and care for animals.

Based on this qualitative analysis, let's estimate the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are subjective and based on the degree to which Adamâ€™s personality traits align with each field. Agricultural and Veterinary Science is clearly the most aligned with his interests and empathy towards animals, hence given the highest probability.
