To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics match the typical profiles of students in these fields. This is a qualitative assessment rather than a precise quantitative one, but it can give us a general sense of the likelihoods.

1. **Computer Science**: Adam is described as having high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, which are traits beneficial for computer science. While he enjoys solving puzzles, his passion for nature, empathy, and love for animals are not particularly aligned with this field. Therefore, the probability is moderate.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and a deep love for animals, which fits well with this field. His strong empathy and warm heart also align well with the human-animal bond often found in veterinary science. Thus, the likelihood is high.

3. **Business Administration**: While Adamâ€™s high intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication can be beneficial in business, his personality sketch does not highlight interests typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, a strong focus on finance, or a competitive nature. Thus, the likelihood is low.

Given these qualitative assessments, here are the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
