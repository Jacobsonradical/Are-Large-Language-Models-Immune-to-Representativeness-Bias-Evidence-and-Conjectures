To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we can apply some general reasoning based on his traits. This process can be thought of as informal Bayesian reasoning where we consider the likelihood of each field given the described characteristics.

1. **Computer Science:** Adam has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits are highly relevant to success in computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals are less directly related to computer science.
2. **Business Administration:** Although Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication can be helpful in business administration, his strong empathy and love for nature and animals aren't particularly central traits for this field.
3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy are very well aligned with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with this field, as these traits are crucial for success.

Given these considerations, the approximate probabilities could be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's personality traits are most strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science, followed by computer science, with business administration being the least likely field of enrollment given his characteristics.
