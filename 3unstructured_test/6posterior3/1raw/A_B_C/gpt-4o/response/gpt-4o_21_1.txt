To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we need to consider the likelihood that a person with such traits would choose each field. These probabilities are subjective estimations based on the traits described:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are important for computer science. However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals might make this field less likely compared to others more closely aligned with his interests in nature and animals.
   
2. **Business Administration**: While it's possible for empathetic individuals to enter business administration, this field typically does not align closely with a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, or interest in solving puzzles in a scientific context. Thus, it might be a less likely choice for Adam.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field closely aligns with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, warm heart, and strong empathy. His appreciation for dedication and hard work also support this field. This makes agricultural and veterinary science a highly probable field of study for Adam.

Based on this reasoning, the subjective probabilities can be assigned as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
