To estimate the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the mentioned fields based on his personality sketch, we need to consider how his traits align with the typical characteristics and requirements expected from students in each of these fields. This will be a subjective assessment, as we don't have exact probabilistic models.

1. **Business Administration (MBA)**
   - Traits: High intelligence, understanding of hard work, and appreciation for dedication could fit, but traits like a quiet nature, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not strongly align with typical traits of business students. MBA students tend to be more extroverted and oriented towards human interaction and leadership roles.
   
2. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - Traits: High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles are closely aligned with the skills needed in computer science. While the curiosity about nature and love for animals are not a perfect fit, they don't contradict a potential interest in CS.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - Traits: Genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, deep love for animals, high intelligence, a strong understanding, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are highly indicative of someone in this field. These traits closely match what is expected from students studying agricultural and veterinary science.

Therefore, considering the alignment of his personality traits with the expectations and characteristics of students in each field, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.30,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65
}
```

Note that these values are subjective estimates based on personality alignment and should not be taken as mathematically rigorous probabilities.
