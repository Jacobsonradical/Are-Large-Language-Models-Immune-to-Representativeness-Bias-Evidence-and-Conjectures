To compute the posterior conditional probability, we consider the specific personality traits and interests that are associated with each field. Since we do not have specific numerical probabilities or base rates, we'll rely on qualitative analysis to estimate these probabilities.

**Business Administration:** Typically requires strong skills in leadership, management, economics, and strategic thinking. Adam's traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and a love for animals do not strongly align with the main skills and interests required for this field. Hence, the probability is lower.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** This field aligns well with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals. His empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication further suggest a fit for this field. The probability is higher.

**Computer Science:** This field involves high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, which aligns with Adam's traits of being good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. However, other traits such as his focus on nature and animals are not as relevant. The probability is moderate.

Considering these points:
{
  "business administration": 0.1, 
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7, 
  "computer science": 0.2
}
