Based on Adam's personality sketch, let's consider the likelihood that he fits into each of the given fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, and a warm heart with strong empathy. These characteristics align closely with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Business Administration:** There is no mention of traits typically associated with business administration, such as an interest in leadership, management, or economic systems. While his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be valuable in business, there is not a strong indication that this is his field based on the provided information.

3. **Computer Science:** Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are important in computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals does not particularly align with the main focus of computer science.

Given these analyses, here are the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect the strong alignment of Adam's personality with agricultural and veterinary science, the moderate alignment with computer science, and the weak alignment with business administration.
