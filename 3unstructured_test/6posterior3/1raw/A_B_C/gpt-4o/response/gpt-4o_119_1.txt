To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of these fields given his personality sketch, we need to make some qualitative assessments. Bayesian inference in this context would require us to estimate the prior probability of Adam enrolling in each field and the likelihood of someone with his personality sketch being enrolled in each field.

Given Adam's background:
1. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: This is relevant to fields like computer science.
2. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals**: This aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, appreciation for hard work and dedication**: These traits are less distinctive for business administration, though they can be relevant.

Considering these points, here is a qualitative estimation of the probabilities:

- **Business Administration**: While empathy and hard work are valued in this field, the stronger alignment is with nature, animals, and curiosity, which is less specific to business administration. 
  - Estimated Probability: 0.1
  
- **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence and capability with abstract concepts are important for computer science. However, his strong ties to nature and animals are not particularly indicative of this field.
  - Estimated Probability: 0.3
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field perfectly aligns with Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and empathy.
  - Estimated Probability: 0.6

Thus, summarizing:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
