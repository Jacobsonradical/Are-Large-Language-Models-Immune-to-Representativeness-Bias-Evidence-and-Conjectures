To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of event A occurring given that event B is true.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of event B occurring given that event A is true.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event A.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability of event B.

However, we don't have the specific prior probabilities or likelihoods (\( P(B|A) \)) available. Therefore, we will make some qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality traits and their correlation with the fields in question. These are subjective assessments meant to provide a sense of the probabilities rather than exact calculations.

- Business Administration: This field typically requires a personality interested in management, finance, and corporate strategy. While Adam is highly intelligent and has empathy, his love for nature, plants, and animals doesn't strongly suggest a correlation with business administration.
- Computer Science: This field requires strong problem-solving skills, intelligence, and an understanding of abstract concepts. Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence aligns well with this field.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are strong indicators that this field aligns with his interests.

Based on this qualitative assessment:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values are meant to reflect the qualitative likelihood based on the given personality sketch.
