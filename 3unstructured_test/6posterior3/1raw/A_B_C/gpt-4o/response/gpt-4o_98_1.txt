To estimate the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields based on the provided personality sketch, I'll primarily rely on the match between the character traits and the typical skills and interests important in those fields. 

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants and a deep love for animals. These traits directly align with agricultural and veterinary science, which often involves working with plants, animals, and nature. Additionally, his empathy and appreciation for dedication match well with the care-oriented approach needed in these fields.

- **Business Administration**: This field typically requires strong leadership, strategic thinking, and people management skills. While Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work are valuable traits, his quiet nature and empathy, while beneficial, are not the defining characteristics one typically associates with business administration.

- **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, which are crucial traits in computer science. However, there is no direct mention of an interest in technology, programming, or computers, which are central to this field.

Considering the above points, here are the estimated posterior probabilities:
