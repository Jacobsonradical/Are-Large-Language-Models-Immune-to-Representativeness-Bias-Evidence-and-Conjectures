To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his described traits align with typical or common traits for students in these fields. Although we don't have exact probabilities or empirical data, we can make an educated estimate based on the qualitative information provided.

Here's a consideration for each field:

- **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals with high intelligence and an aptitude for solving abstract problems and puzzles. However, the sketch emphasizes Adam's deep love for nature and animals, which is less commonly associated with computer science students.

- **Business Administration**: This field typically values leadership, people skills, and business acumen. Adam's empathy and warm heart could fit, but the sketch highlights his curiosity about nature and love for animals, which doesn't strongly align with a typical business administration focus.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are highly indicative of this field. The alignment of his interests and values with agricultural and veterinary science is the strongest among the given options.

Considering these reasonings, here's the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are qualitative estimates based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the characteristics typically seen in students of these fields.
