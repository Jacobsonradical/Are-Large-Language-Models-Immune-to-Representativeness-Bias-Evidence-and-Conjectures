To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields, given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning. We need to evaluate how well Adam’s traits fit the typical traits and interests of students in each field.

Given the details:
- Genuine curiosity about nature.
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

We can assess how each trait aligns with the common characteristics of students in each field:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Curious about nature and plants: High relevance.
- Love for animals: High relevance.
- Empathy and warm heart: High relevance for veterinary roles.
- Appreciation for hard work: Relevant as agriculture and veterinary science often require practical, hands-on work.
- Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts: Relevant but less crucial.

**Business Administration:**
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Relevant.
- Empathy and warm heart: Some relevance, especially for managing teams.
- Curiosity about nature, plants, and animals: Low relevance.
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: Relevant in analytical roles but less typical for broader business roles.

**Computer Science:**
- Enjoys solving puzzles: High relevance.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Very high relevance.
- Quiet: Can be relevant.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant.
- Empathy and love for nature, plants, and animals: Low relevance.

Considering these points, we can provide a likelihood estimate as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These values are subjective assessments based on the fit between Adam’s personality traits and the typical characteristics of each field.
