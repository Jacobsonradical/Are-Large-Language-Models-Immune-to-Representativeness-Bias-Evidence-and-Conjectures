To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, I need to consider how well his traits align with the typical traits of students in each field.

1. **Business Administration**: Generally, this field attracts individuals who are more extroverted, focused on leadership, management, and business strategy. Adam's traits of being quiet, empathetic, and having a deep love for animals do not strongly align with this field. Therefore, the probability is likely low.

2. **Computer Science**: This field values high intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving skills. Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts well, which are important traits for computer science. However, his focus on nature and animals is less relevant here, suggesting a moderate probability.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field perfectly aligns with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals. His empathy and understanding of hard work also fit well. This field has a high probability given Adam's personality sketch.

Based on this qualitative analysis, here are the approximate conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Note that these values are estimates based on qualitative matching of Adam's traits with typical characteristics of students in each field. The actual probabilities could vary depending on additional data and context.
