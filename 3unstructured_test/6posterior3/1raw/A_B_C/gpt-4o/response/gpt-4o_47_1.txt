To compute the posterior probabilities given Adam's personality sketch, we use a heuristic or Bayesian approach, taking into account the likelihood of each field matching his personality traits and interests. 

1. **Business Administration (BA)**: 
   - Likelihood based on personality: Low. Curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles, empathy, and understanding abstract concepts are less characteristic of someone in BA.
   - Prior probability (general population distribution): Medium to high, BA is a common field.
   - Overall posterior: Low.

2. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - Likelihood based on personality: Medium to High. Solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with CS.
   - Prior probability: Medium to high, CS is a common field.
   - Overall posterior: Medium.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**:
   - Likelihood based on personality: Very high. Curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and understanding hard work align very closely with AVS.
   - Prior probability: Lower than CS and BA, but still significant in specific contexts.
   - Overall posterior: High.

Based on these qualitative assessments, the posterior probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
