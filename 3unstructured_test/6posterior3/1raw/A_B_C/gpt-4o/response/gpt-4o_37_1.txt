To compute the posterior probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality sketch matches each field. This involves assessing the likelihood that a person with Adam's traits would be enrolled in these fields, also taking into account typical characteristics associated with these fields. 

Here’s a rough assessment based on the provided personality sketch:

1. **Business Administration**: Generally involves leadership, people management, strategic thinking, and an interest in business operations. Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, puzzles, and empathy do not strongly align with this field.
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field involves an interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, which matches Adam’s profile well.
3. **Computer Science**: Typically involves problem-solving, abstract concepts, and intelligence. Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence align fairly well with this field.

Given this qualitative assessment, let's assign approximate posterior probabilities. This is a subjective estimation rather than a precise calculation:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

These values reflect the match between Adam's interests and traits with those generally associated with each field.
