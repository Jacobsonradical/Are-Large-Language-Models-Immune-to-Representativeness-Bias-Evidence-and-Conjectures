To determine the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields based on his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics align with the typical attributes and interests associated with each field. Here, we apply a heuristic Bayesian approach to approximate these probabilities.

Adam's personality traits are:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet demeanor
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted, empathetic, and loves animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Now, let's consider how these traits align with the characteristics generally associated with each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Traits like curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with this field.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, there is less alignment with nature-related traits and empathy.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - Appreciation for hard work can be relevant, but other traits such as love for animals and curiosity about nature are less relevant.

Given these alignments, we can approximate the probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science, a moderate likelihood for computer science, and a lower likelihood for business administration, based on the provided personality sketch.
