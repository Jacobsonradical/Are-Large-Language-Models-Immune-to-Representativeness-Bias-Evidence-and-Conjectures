To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the three fields given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning. We'll make qualitative assessments based on the compatibility of his characteristics with the fields in question.

Let's break down each field and match it with Adam's personality traits:

**1. Business Administration:**
- Generally involves leadership, management, and finance.
- Adam's traits: curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, empathy, and love for animals.
- Less alignment with Adam's traits. 

**2. Computer Science:**
- Requires strong problem-solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts.
- Adam's traits: enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Good alignment with these traits.

**3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Involves working with nature, plants, and animals.
- Adam's traits: curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong understanding, and appreciation for hard work.
- Excellent alignment with these traits.

Given these alignments, we can qualitatively assess the probabilities. Note that without solid statistical data, these are heuristic estimates.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.60
}
```

These values reflect the perceived likelihood based on the given personality sketch and the typical requirements and nature of each field.
