To compute the posterior conditional probability for each given field based on Adam's personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits match the typical characteristics desired or beneficial in each field. While this is a subjective evaluation without precise numerical data, we can provide an educated estimate based on his interests and characteristics.

- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and deep love for animals strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
- His high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, considering the field's reliance on problem-solving and abstract thinking.
- While his appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant in business administration, his specific traits seem less explicitly aligned with the typical focus of business studies compared to the other two fields.

Based on these considerations, here is an estimation:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values are subjective estimates that reflect the alignment of Adam's personality with the traits valued in each field.
