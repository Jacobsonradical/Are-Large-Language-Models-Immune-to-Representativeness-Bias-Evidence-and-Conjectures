To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field based on his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics align with typical qualities associated with students in each of these fields.

Let's analyze each field in relation to Adam's personality traits:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Characteristics: high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - Less fitting characteristics: strong empathy, deep love for animals, appreciation for nature and plants.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Characteristics: high intelligence, appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - Less fitting characteristics: warm heart, strong empathy, genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, enjoys solving puzzles.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Characteristics: genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, deep love for animals, strong empathy, warm heart.
   - Less fitting characteristics: high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles.

Given these analyses, let's assign probabilities between 0 and 1. These are not absolute and should be seen as educated estimates based on the personality traits given.

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
