To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality sketch matches each field and use those to inform our estimates. 

Given the details:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are direct matches for this field. Therefore, the probability that he was enrolled in this field is relatively high.

2. Business Administration: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is highly intelligent, which can be useful in business contexts. However, the lack of direct interest in business, economics, or management-related aspects makes this less likely.

3. Computer Science: Adam's high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with computer science, especially if he has an interest in abstract concepts. However, his lack of explicit interest in technology or computational topics makes this field less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on these qualitative assessments, here are the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
