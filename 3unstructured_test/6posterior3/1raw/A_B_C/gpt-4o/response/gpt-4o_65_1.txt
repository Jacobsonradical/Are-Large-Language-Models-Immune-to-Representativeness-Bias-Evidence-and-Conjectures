To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we'll make use of Bayesian reasoning. Consider the likelihood of someone with Adam's personality sketch being in each field and the prior probability of graduate students being in each field. Without specific prior probabilities for each field, we assume equal priors for simplification purposes, but adjust our final probabilities according to the personality fit for each field.

Given Adam's deep love for nature, animals, and plants, empathy, warmth, and interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of hard work and dedication, these traits seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts could fit well with computer science but are less characteristic of business administration.

Let's estimate the posterior conditional probabilities based on these considerations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam’s traits strongly align with this field (love for animals and nature, strong empathy).
   - Likelihood is high.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam’s high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills fit well.
   - Likelihood is moderate.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - Adam’s profile lacks direct characteristics aligning with this field.
   - Likelihood is low.

The approximate probabilities (normalizing but not to sum to 1 to follow the prompt) may be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Note: These values are qualitative estimates based on the provided personality sketch and should be refined with actual statistical data for precise computation.
