To compute the posterior probabilities, we need to think about how well Adam's personality aligns with each field. However, since we are dealing with textual information and not numerical data, we can only provide a subjective estimate based on the description given. Below is the approximate reasoning for each field based on Adam's characteristics:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Deep love for animals.

These traits strongly suggest a high probability of Adam being enrolled in this field.

**Computer Science:**
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.

While Adam's personality fits well with some aspects of computer science (problem-solving and abstract thinking), his strong empathy and love for animals suggest an inclination towards a more life science-oriented field.

**Business Administration:**
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication might be somewhat aligned with business administration.
- However, the other personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) do not strongly suggest a fit for this field.

Based on these assessments, here are the subjective posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These probabilities reflect the fit of Adam's personality with each field, though keep in mind they are subjective estimates.
