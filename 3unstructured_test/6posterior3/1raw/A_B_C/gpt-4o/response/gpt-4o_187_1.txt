To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in one of the given fields based on his personality sketch, Bayes' Theorem can be conceptually applied. However, without exact prior probabilities (base rates) for each field of study, we will use qualitative reasoning based on the match between Adam's characteristics and the typical qualities required or admired in those fields. 

Given the provided personality sketch of Adam, we can make the following qualitative probability estimations:

1. **Business Administration**: Adam’s personality does not strongly align with common traits found in business administration students, such as a focus on leadership, strategy, and finance. He lacks any explicit inclinations towards business, economics, or similar domains in his profile.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam’s deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, and his empathy strongly align with this field. This field tends to attract students who have strong ties to nature and care deeply about animals and plant life.

3. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are valuable traits in computer science. His ability to understand abstract concepts also aligns well with this field. However, there is still a relatively stronger alignment with agricultural and veterinary science based on the given sketch.

Therefore, my qualitative estimations (not quantified with precise probabilities, but using reasoning) would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

These values reflect a predominant likelihood that Adam would be pursuing agricultural and veterinary science given his interests and personality, with a moderate possibility of computer science due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills, and a minimal likelihood of business administration.
