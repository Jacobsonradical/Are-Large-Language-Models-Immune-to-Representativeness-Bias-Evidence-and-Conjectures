To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we will use a qualitative analysis based on how well his personality traits fit the typical characteristics of each field. This won't yield precise numerical probabilities but will give a sense of which fields are more or less likely for Adam.

Based on his personality sketch:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants.
- He loves animals and has strong empathy.
- He is intelligent and good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these traits, let's assess the likelihood for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field.
   - Likelihood: **High**

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align well.
   - No direct mention of interest in technology or computing, but analytical and problem-solving skills support this.
   - Likelihood: **Moderate**

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication fits well.
   - No direct mention of interest in business, management, or economic aspects.
   - Likelihood: **Low**

Based on the analysis,
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values are qualitative estimates reflecting how well Adam's personality traits align with each field. Remember, actual probabilities would depend on more detailed statistical data about graduate enrollments and personality correlations in these fields.
