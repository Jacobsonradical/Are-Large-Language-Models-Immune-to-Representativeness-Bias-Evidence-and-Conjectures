Let's analyze Adam's personality sketch in relation to the three fields:

1. **Business administration**:  
Business administration typically involves strong interpersonal skills, leadership qualities, and interests in economics, finance, and management. Adam's personality sketch indicates he is a quiet boy with a deep love for animals and nature, high intelligence, and empathy. These traits do not strongly align with the typical traits of someone studying business administration.

2. **Computer science**:  
Computer Science often attracts individuals who enjoy solving abstract problems and puzzles, which aligns with Adam's traits of high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles. However, there is no specific mention of a strong interest in technology or programming in Adam's personality sketch, making it less certain.

3. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:  
This field involves a strong understanding and appreciation of nature, plants, and animals, along with dedication and hard work. Based on the provided sketch, Adam shows a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and a warm heart, making this field highly compatible with his personality traits.

Based on these considerations, we can estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70
}

These values reflect the likelihood that Adam's personality traits align with each respective field of study.
