To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields based on his personality sketch, we can use qualitative reasoning. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work provide valuable information to make a qualitative assessment.

Here is the qualitative assessment of the probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam’s curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and appreciation for hard work closely align with the traits typical for someone in this field. These characteristics suggest a higher likelihood that he might be studying agricultural and veterinary science.
   
2. **Business Administration**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are beneficial in business, his personality traits such as a love for animals, curiosity about nature, and warm heart don’t strongly point towards business administration. Business fields typically value different personality traits more heavily, such as assertiveness and leadership.

3. **Computer Science**: Adam’s enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence are beneficial in computer science. However, his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are not directly related to typical motivations for studying this field. Therefore, it is a less strong match compared to agricultural and veterinary science but a better match than business administration.

Given this qualitative reasoning, here are the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect the relative alignment of Adam's personality traits with typical fields of study, though without exact numerical data, these values are purely estimative and qualitative.
