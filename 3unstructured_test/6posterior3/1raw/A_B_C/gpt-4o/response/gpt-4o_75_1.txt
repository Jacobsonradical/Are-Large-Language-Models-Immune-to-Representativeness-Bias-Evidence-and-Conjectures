To estimate the posterior probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with the characteristics typically required or beneficial for each field. While we might not have exact prior probabilities, we can make educated guesses based on the given personality traits.

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and its plants make him a strong candidate for this field.
- Business Administration: While Adam’s intelligence and appreciation for hard work might align with business administration, his other traits (quietness, empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature) are not characteristic of this field.
- Computer Science: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are beneficial for computer science. However, the strong empathy and love for nature and animals are less relevant.

Using this reasoning, here’s an educated estimate of the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.20
}
