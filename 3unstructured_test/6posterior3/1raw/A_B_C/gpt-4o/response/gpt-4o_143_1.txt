To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' Theorem.

However, since we don't have the prior probabilities and likelihoods in this case, we will rely on qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch to assign conditional probabilities.

The given personality sketch paints Adam as someone who has:
- a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants,
- a quiet demeanor,
- enjoys solving puzzles,
- has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals,
- high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts,
- a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Based on these traits, we will assess the probabilities qualitatively:

1. **Business Administration**:
   Adam's personality traits such as love for nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work do not strongly align with the core aspects typically associated with Business Administration, which often requires a focus on management, economics, and organizational behavior.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, combined with his empathy and curiosity about nature, strongly align with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

3. **Computer Science**:
   Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts. These are traits that could align with Computer Science. However, there isn't a direct mention of an interest in technology or computing.

Given these qualitative assessments, the values would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

These values reflect the qualitative likelihood based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the general nature of each field.
