Computing the posterior conditional probability requires some assumptions about the base rates (prior probabilities) for each field and how well Adam's characteristics fit with these fields. I'll assume some reasonable base rates for these fields among graduate students and try to match Adam's characteristics to each field.

Given characteristics for Adam: curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, appreciation for hard work.

1. **Business administration:** Generally involves management, finance, marketing, etc. while it can benefit from intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, it doesnâ€™t directly align with curiosity about nature, plants, or a love for animals.

2. **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Directly aligns with curiosity about nature, plants, and a love for animals. High empathy and understanding of hard work are significant qualities in this field. High probability given his profile.

3. **Computer science:** Requires solving puzzles, an appreciation for abstract concepts, and intelligence, which align well but doesn't align strongly with empathy for animals or a strong connection to nature/plants.

Given these considerations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These probabilities are subjective estimates based on the given characteristics and the general nature of each field.
