To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in specific fields, we need to qualitatively assess how well his personality traits align with typical characteristics required or beneficial in each field. Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: Highly relevant.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Strongly relevant.
   - However, no mention of a strong interest in technology or programming.
   - Overall fit: Moderate to High 

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants: Highly relevant.
   - Strong empathy and deep love for animals: Highly relevant.
   - Warm heart and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Highly relevant.
   - Overall fit: Very High

3. **Business Administration**:
   - While high intelligence is relevant, the personality sketch does not mention interest in business, leadership, or management which are key in business administration.
   - Overall fit: Low

Considering these qualitative assessments, here are the likely conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values represent a subjective analysis based on how well Adam's traits align with each field. Agricultural and Veterinary Science emerges as the most likely field due to his stated interests and characteristics. Computer Science still holds potential due to his intelligence and love of puzzles but ranks lower due to the lack of a stated tech interest. Business Administration is less likely due to a mismatch in typical personality traits associated with the field.
