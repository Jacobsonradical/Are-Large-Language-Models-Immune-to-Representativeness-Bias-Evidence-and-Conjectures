To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how closely Adam's personality traits align with the typical traits associated with each field of study. This isn’t an exact science and would typically involve more data and Bayesian statistical methods, but we can provide a qualitative approximation based on the given personality sketch:

- **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, and a deep love for animals. This aligns very closely with agricultural and veterinary science, which often requires a strong empathy towards animals and a deep appreciation for nature.

- **Business administration:** Adam’s personality traits, such as a warm heart, strong empathy, and a love for animals, do not strongly point towards business administration. Though he is intelligent, there is little in his sketch indicating an interest in business-related activities or administrative tasks.

- **Computer science:** Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, both of which are critical skills in computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals and nature are not directly relevant to this field.

Given these alignments, the qualitative assessments of posterior conditional probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values are subjective estimates based on the given information and indicative alignment of Adam's personality traits with each field.
