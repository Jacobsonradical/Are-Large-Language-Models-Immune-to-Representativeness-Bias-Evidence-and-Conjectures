To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we should consider how well Adam's personality sketch matches each field. This approach involves a qualitative Bayesian reasoning, taking into account the relevance of his traits to each field.

Given that Adam has a deep love for animals, a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and a warm heart, these traits strongly suggest a fit with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, but the other aspects of his personality suggest a stronger inclination towards a field that involves nature and animals. Business administration doesn't align as well with his empathy and nature-related interests.

Hereâ€™s a qualitative assessment:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

This allocation reflects the strong alignment of Adam's interests and personality traits with agricultural and veterinary science, while also recognizing the intelligence (abstract thinking) that could fit him into computer science, and a low probability of business administration given the mismatched traits.
