To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality traits align with each field of study. This involves using Bayes' Theorem, but without detailed prior probabilities and likelihoods, we'll make qualitative assessments based on the given traits.

- **Business Administration**: This field generally values leadership skills, business acumen, and a focus on management and finance. Adam's personality indicates a preference for quiet, thoughtful activities related to nature, animals, and abstract puzzles, which doesn't strongly align with the typical traits sought in business administration.

- **Computer Science**: This field requires strong problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and often involves abstract mathematical concepts. Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence align well with this field. However, it doesn't fully capture his empathy and love for animals.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field directly involves nature, plants, and animals, correlating closely with Adam's curiosity about nature and deep love for animals. His empathy and appreciation for hard work would also be of great value in this field.

Given these qualitative assessments, the probabilities might be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Hereâ€™s the rationale:
- Business Administration (0.1): Least likely due to the mismatch in personality traits.
- Computer Science (0.4): More likely due to his problem-solving abilities and intelligence.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7): Most likely given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
