To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to estimate how well each field matches Adam's described personality traits. Here are the probabilities considering Adam's characteristics and his alignment with typical traits in each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
    - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
    - Enjoys solving puzzles.
    - Quiet personality.
    - However, curiosity about nature and deep love for animals are less correlated with this field.

2. **Business Administration:**
    - Generally less aligned with high empathy and love for animals.
    - While intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant, the strong emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy doesn't fit as well.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - Strongly aligned with curiosity about nature and love for animals.
    - Warm heart and strong empathy perfectly fit the profile of someone in this field.
    - Appreciation for the hard work and dedication matches this field.
    
Based on these alignments, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These probabilities reflect the qualitative assessment of how well Adam's personality sketch fits into each field of specialization.
