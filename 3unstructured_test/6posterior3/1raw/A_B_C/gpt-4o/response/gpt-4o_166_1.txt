To compute the posterior conditional probabilities given Adam's personality sketch, we can utilize our understanding of how his personality traits may align with the characteristics of students in each field. This approach, called "subjective Bayesian reasoning," involves estimating probabilities based on the given information and the context of each field. The approach is qualitative rather than strictly numerical, considering how well Adam's profile fits into each field.

1. **Business Administration:** Adam's personality sketch shows a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and empathy, which don't particularly fit the profile for a typical business administration student. Though his high intelligence and understanding of hard work could be relevant, they are not strong indicators for business administration compared to the other fields.

2. **Computer Science:** Adam's high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align with computer science. However, his deep interest in nature, animals, and empathy-based characteristics are less indicative of this field. Therefore, while there's some alignment due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills, it's not the strongest fit overall.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** This field aligns well with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. His warm heart and dedication also fit well within the context of working with animals and understanding the complex systems involved in agriculture. Therefore, this field has the strongest alignment with his personality sketch.

Given the qualitative nature of the reasoning above, the posterior probabilities might look like:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These estimations reflect the likelihood of Adam being in each field based on how well his personality traits align with the characteristics of students typically found in each field.
