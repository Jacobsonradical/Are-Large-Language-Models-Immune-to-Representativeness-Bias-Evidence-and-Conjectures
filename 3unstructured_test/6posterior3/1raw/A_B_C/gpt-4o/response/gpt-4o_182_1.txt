To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayesian inference. While we cannot quantify these probabilities precisely without detailed base rate information on field enrollments and specific conditional probabilities, we can make a reasoned qualitative assessment based on the given traits.

Here's an estimation considering the traits:

- Agricultural and veterinary science seems highly probable given his love for nature, plants, and animals.
- Computer science is moderately probable since it aligns with his intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles.
- Business administration appears less probable because his personality sketch doesn't strongly align with typical traits for this field (like financial interest or leadership aspirations).

Given these considerations, my qualitative assessment is:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65",
  "computer science": "0.20",
  "business administration": "0.05"
}
```

These values reflect a subjective estimation that agricultural and veterinary science align strongly with his described traits, while computer science is a reasonable secondary field, and business administration is far less likely.
