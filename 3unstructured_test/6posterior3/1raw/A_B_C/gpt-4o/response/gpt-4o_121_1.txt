To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, one can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(Field | Traits) = \frac{P(Traits | Field) \cdot P(Field)}{P(Traits)} \]

Given the information, it might be difficult to provide exact numerical probabilities without access to statistical data and prior probabilities. However, based on qualitative assessment of Adam's traits and typical characteristics associated with these fields, we can make educated guesses for each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam shows a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and loves animals, which aligns very well with this field. He also appreciates hard work and dedication, likely traits valued in this field.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts. While this aligns with strong analytical skills needed for computer science, his deep love for animals and nature curiosity seem less relevant here.

3. **Business Administration**: Adam's traits like empathy and appreciating hard work and dedication can be beneficial in business administration. However, his love for animals, nature, and solving puzzles does not directly align with the typical focus of business administration.

Taking these factors into account, the probabilities can be informally estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values are meant to reflect the degree to which Adam's traits align with each field, not absolute probabilities. They are based on the assumption that Adam's personality traits are more closely aligned with the field of agricultural and veterinary science compared to the other fields.
