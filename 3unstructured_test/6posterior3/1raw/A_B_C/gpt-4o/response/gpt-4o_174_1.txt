To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to combine Adam's personality traits with the likelihood of each field providing a good match to those traits. It's important to note that this is not a precise calculation but an estimation based on the provided sketch.

From his personality sketch, we deduce:

1. **Agriculture and Veterinary Science**:
   - Interest in nature and plants.
   - Love for animals.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy.
   These traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science, suggesting a relatively high probability.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Quiet demeanor, enjoys solving puzzles.
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
   These traits point towards computer science but not as strongly as the first field due to the lack of explicit interest in technology.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Appreciates hard work and dedication.
   - Overall personality is not heavily business-oriented with regard to traits like curiosity about nature and empathy.
   Business administration seems the least likely, given the described passions and interests.

Based on these assessments, here's an estimation:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These estimated values reflect Adam's personality alignment with each field, with the highest probability being in agricultural and veterinary science due to his strong interests in nature and animals.
