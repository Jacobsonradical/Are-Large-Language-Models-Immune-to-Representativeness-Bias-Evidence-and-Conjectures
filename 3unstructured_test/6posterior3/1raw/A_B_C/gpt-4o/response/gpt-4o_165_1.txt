To compute the posterior probabilities for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we can utilise Bayes' theorem. However, we'll primarily rely on qualitative reasoning due to a lack of specific data.

Based on the personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his warm heart and empathy, this field fits well with his interests and personality traits. Adam's appreciation for hard work also aligns with the dedication required in this field.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment in solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts are traits that fit well in computer science. However, the lack of direct mention of interest in technology or programming weakens this match.

3. **Business Administration**: This seems less likely given Adam's personality traits. Business administration typically requires strong social and leadership skills, and while Adam has empathy and a strong work ethic, the sketch doesn't highlight interests or traits fitting this field specifically.

Using this qualitative reasoning, the posterior probabilities could be approximated as:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
