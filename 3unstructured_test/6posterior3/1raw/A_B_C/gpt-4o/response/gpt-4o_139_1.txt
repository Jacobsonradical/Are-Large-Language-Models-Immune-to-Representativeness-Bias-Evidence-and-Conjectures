To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we will qualitatively assess which field most aligns with Adam's personality sketch and then assign probability values based on the alignment.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field. These traits are particularly valuable in agricultural and veterinary sciences where understanding living organisms and their environments is crucial.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Although Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are traits beneficial for computer science, the sketch does not strongly suggest a computer science focus compared to his affinity for nature and animals.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Business administration typically requires skills in leadership, management, and economics. While Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work, the personality traits highlighted (empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature) donâ€™t explicitly point towards this field.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's distribute the probabilities:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: High probability given the alignment with his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals.
- **Computer Science**: Moderate probability due to his high intelligence and problem-solving skills.
- **Business Administration**: Lower probability as the personality traits described do not significantly match with typical business administration qualities.

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities could be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

This approximate distribution reflects a higher likelihood that Adam's field of study in graduate school relates strongly to his interest in nature and animals.
