To provide an estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields given his personality sketch, we should consider how well his personality traits and interests fit with each field. The probability values will be subjective estimates as we don't have specific data or priors to quantify the probabilities precisely. 

Based on the provided personality sketch:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work, all of which align well with this field.
- **Computer Science:** Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts. These traits are favorable for computer science, though his specific interest in nature and animals is less directly applicable.
- **Business Administration:** Adam's strong empathy and warm heart could be beneficial in business administration, but the other traits like love for nature, plants, and animals are less aligned with this field.

Therefore, the estimated conditional probabilities based on his personality traits could be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
