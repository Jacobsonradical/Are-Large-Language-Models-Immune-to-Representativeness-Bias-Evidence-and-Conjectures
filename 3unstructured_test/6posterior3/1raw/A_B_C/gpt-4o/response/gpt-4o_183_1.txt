To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality traits match with the typical traits of students in each of the given fields. This involves using our understanding of these fields and assessing which traits are more likely to be prevalent among students in each field. 

Given Adam’s strong curiosity about nature and plants, warmth, empathy, love for animals, quiet demeanor, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, the agricultural and veterinary science field seems to align well with his personality. Computer science could also be a fit, especially considering his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, but the direct connection to nature and animals is less evident. Business administration appears to be the least likely match, as it's less closely aligned with Adam’s love for nature and animals, although his intelligence and understanding of hard work could also be relevant there.

Given these considerations, here is the estimated posterior conditional probability for each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These figures are approximations based on the given personality sketch and may change with additional information.
