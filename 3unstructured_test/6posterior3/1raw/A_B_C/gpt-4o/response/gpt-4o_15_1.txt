To compute the posterior probabilities, we need to evaluate how well Adam's personality traits align with the typical characteristics associated with each field. While exact numerical values would require detailed statistical data on personality distributions by field, we can make a qualitative assessment based on his traits.

1. **Business Administration**: 
   - Traits like empathy and understanding hard work could align with Business as it involves working with people and understanding organizational dynamics.
   - However, there is no strong evidence of interest in economic, managerial, or entrepreneurial skills which are crucial in business administration. 
   - Thus, the probability is moderate to low.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are notably beneficial in Computer Science.
   - Enjoying solving puzzles is a key trait for fields requiring problem-solving and analytical skills, commonly found in Computer Science students.
   - However, an explicit love for nature and animals doesn't align as strongly with Computer Science unless it intersects with bioinformatics or similar fields.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - A genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy is highly aligned with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Dedication and understanding hard work align well with the demands of this field.
   - This field appears to be the most congruent with Adam's described personality traits.

Assessing these qualitative fits, we can outline the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values represent the likelihood of Adam being in each respective field based on the qualitative match of his personality traits with the demands and nature of the fields. The numbers do not sum to 1, acknowledging that there are other potential fields Adam could be enrolled in.
