To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields, we need to consider how well his personality traits align with each field. Here's an analysis of Adam's personality sketch in relation to each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and a warm heart with strong empathy. These traits strongly align with this field, as it involves both plant and animal sciences and requires a compassionate approach to dealing with living organisms.

2. **Business Administration**: While Adam has a high intelligence and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, the personality traits such as empathy, curiosity about nature, and love for animals don't directly align with the key skills typically prioritized in business administration, such as leadership, strategic thinking, and financial acumen. 

3. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are qualities that fit well with computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for nature, and animals do not necessarily align with the technical and logical focus of this field.

Based on this qualitative assessment, we can assign approximate posterior conditional probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's personality traits are most consistent with agricultural and veterinary science, somewhat consistent with computer science, and least consistent with business administration.
