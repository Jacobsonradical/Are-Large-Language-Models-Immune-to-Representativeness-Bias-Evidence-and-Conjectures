To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. This is a heuristic approach and would ideally be backed by empirical data, but we can make reasonable assumptions based on the provided information.

Let's consider Adam's interests and characteristics:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Empathy and deep love for animals.
3. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
4. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.
5. Enjoys solving puzzles.

Based on these points, we can make some educated guesses:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests a fit for this field. His empathy and curiosity about nature further strengthen this likelihood.
- Business Administration: There is less direct alignment between Adam's interests and business administration. While appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant, it isn't a strong indicator by itself.
- Computer Science: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence suggest compatibility with computer science, particularly because understanding abstract concepts is crucial in this field.

Without precise probabilities or population data, we'll estimate the posterior probabilities qualitatively. 

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These probabilities reflect that Adam is most likely to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, with some likelihood of being in Computer Science and a lower likelihood of being in Business Administration.
