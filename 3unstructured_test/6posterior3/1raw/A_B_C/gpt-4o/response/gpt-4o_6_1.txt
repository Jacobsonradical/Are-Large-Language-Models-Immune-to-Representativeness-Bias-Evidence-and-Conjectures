To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we typically use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context involves evaluating how well Adam's personality traits match the common traits of students in these fields of study. Since we have limited specific statistical data, I'll provide a reasoned estimate based on the information given.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, it seems that some fields align more closely with these traits than others.

Here's an estimated posterior conditional probability distribution:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Computer Science (0.2)**:
   - Adam's intelligence and enjoyments like solving puzzles align well with this field, where problem-solving and abstract thinking are crucial. However, his curiosity about nature and love for animals don't strongly align with the typical interests of computer science students.

2. **Business Administration (0.05)**:
   - While it requires intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, Adam's empathy, warm heart, and deep love for plants and animals do not strongly correlate with business administration which is more focused on economics, management, and human organizational dynamics.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.75)**:
   - This field strongly aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication in understanding natural sciences and animal care.

These probabilities reflect the qualitative alignment between Adam's personality traits and the typical characteristics of students in these fields.
