To determine the posterior probabilities for Adam's enrollment in each field given his personality sketch, we need to use the relevant factors from his personality and match them to the likely fields of graduate study. This involves intuitive estimation rather than precise statistical computation, as we lack specific numerical data.

Here's the analysis:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Based on Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, this field strongly aligns with his interests. His high intelligence and empathy will also serve well in this field, where understanding living organisms and caring for them is crucial.
   
2. **Business Administration**: Adam's personality sketch does not directly relate to the traits typically associated with business administration, such as interest in commerce, management, or strategic thinking. His quiet nature and focus on puzzles and empathy suggest a lesser alignment with this field.
   
3. **Computer Science**: While Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence could align with computer science, his strong interest in nature and love for animals seem to steer his primary interests elsewhere. He might appreciate abstract concepts in computing, but it does not appear to be his primary passion based on the given sketch.

Thus, estimating the probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
