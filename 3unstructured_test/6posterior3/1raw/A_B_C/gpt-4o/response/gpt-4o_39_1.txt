Given Adam's personality sketch, it is reasonable to compute the posterior conditional probability that he is enrolled in each field based on the alignment of his characteristics with the typical attributes and interests of students within those fields. Hereâ€™s the analysis for each given field:

1. **Business Administration**: This field typically involves strong interpersonal skills, interest in economic systems, leadership qualities, and a keen interest in organizational processes. While Adam is intelligent, empathetic, and has a strong understanding of hard work and dedication, his interest in nature, puzzles, and animals does not strongly align with typical interests in business administration.
   
2. **Computer Science**: In this field, high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles are advantageous. An appreciation for abstract concepts also aligns well with computer science. However, Adam's interests in nature and animals are not particularly relevant to this field, which somewhat decreases the probability but does not eliminate the possibility entirely.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field directly aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and his love for animals. His strong empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication further support this alignment. Thus, this field seems the most likely fit given Adam's personality sketch.

Based on this qualitative assessment, here are the probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These probabilities are subjective estimations based on the provided personality sketch and the typical student profiles associated with these fields.
