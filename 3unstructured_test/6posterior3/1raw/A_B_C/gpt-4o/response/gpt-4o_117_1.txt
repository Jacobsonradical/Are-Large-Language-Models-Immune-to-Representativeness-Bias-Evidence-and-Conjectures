To compute the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields, we need to apply Bayesian inference. This involves considering the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given enrollment in each field and using prior probabilities for enrollment in each field among graduate students.

Let's start by examining the likelihoods:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - A strong curiosity about nature and plants is closely related to this field.
   - A love for animals is also a direct indicator.
   - High empathy is beneficial in veterinary science.
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns well.

   Given these points, the likelihood of Adam's personality traits if he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is high.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Solving puzzles and high intelligence can be useful, but empathy, love for nature, and animals are less directly related.
   - While appreciating hard work is important, the personality characteristics relate less strongly to this field.

   The likelihood of Adam's traits if he is in Business Administration is relatively lower.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and puzzle-solving fit well with this field.
   - Understanding abstract concepts also aligns.
   - Love for nature and animals, and high empathy are less direct indicators.
   
   The likelihood of Adam's traits if he is in Computer Science is moderate.

Now, considering priors (assumed for the purpose of this general example), one might say:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 10%
- Business Administration: 30%
- Computer Science: 25%

The posterior probabilities can be roughly estimated as follows:
(Note: Exact Bayesian updating would require more precise prior data and likelihood functions, but this is a qualitative approach).

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,  // High likelihood and possible moderate prior
  "business administration": 0.1,            // Low likelihood despite higher prior
  "computer science": 0.3                    // Moderate likelihood with moderate prior
}
```

These values reflect a higher posterior probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to the strong alignment of Adam's traits. Business Administration is lower since Adam's empathy and love for nature don't align as well with typical traits needed. Computer Science is in-between, given some aspects like intelligence and puzzle-solving align well, but empathy and nature-related traits do not.
