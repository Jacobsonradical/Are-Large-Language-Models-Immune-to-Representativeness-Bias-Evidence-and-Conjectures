To compute the posterior probabilities for each field of study based on the personality sketch of Adam, we use Bayesian reasoning. Although we do not have specific prior probabilities or detailed data, we can use qualitative reasoning to estimate these probabilities based on the match between Adam's characteristics and the typical traits and interests associated with each field.

Here are reasonable estimates based on the given information:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a strong curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and a warm heart with strong empathy. These traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science, which involves working with nature and animals. Therefore, this field is highly compatible with his personality sketch.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with an aptitude for abstract concepts. These traits are also highly valued in computer science. However, given his strong ties to nature and empathy, this field seems slightly less aligned compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Business Administration**: While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, and has high intelligence, the other specific interests given in the sketch such as curiosity about nature and empathy do not as strongly suggest a fit for this field. Business administration typically involves a different set of interests and skills.

Based on this reasoning, here are the estimated posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values are qualitative and based on the match between Adam's personality and the typical demands and interests of each field.
