To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each given field based on his personality sketch, we apply Bayesian reasoning. Here's our subjective analysis based on his described attributes:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, strong empathy, and a deep understanding of hard work and dedication. These characteristics most closely align with fields related to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- His high intelligence and capability with abstract concepts link moderately well with computer science, as these traits are essential in that field.
- While he might appreciate the importance of dedication and hard work, the strong empathetic nature and deep love for animals make him less likely to be drawn to business administration, a field typically more oriented towards managerial and economic skills.

Given these considerations, the approximate subjective posterior probabilities for each field are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
