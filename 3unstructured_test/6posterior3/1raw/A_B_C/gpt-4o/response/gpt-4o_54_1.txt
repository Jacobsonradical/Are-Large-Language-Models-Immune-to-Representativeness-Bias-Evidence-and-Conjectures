To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each given field based on his personality sketch, we must consider how well his traits align with the typical interests and skills required for each field. This isn't an exact science, but we can reason through each based on given information:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Typically involves leadership, management, decision-making, and often a strong interest in commerce.
   - Adam's traits of curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, and love for animals don't strongly align with business administration.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Involves a deep interest in nature, plants, animals, and often a strong appreciation of hard work and dedication.
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with this field.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Involves logical thinking, solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence.
   - Adam's love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science.

Based on this reasoning:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to the high congruence of his personality traits with the field, and a substantial but lesser probability of being in Computer Science. The likelihood for Business Administration is quite low given the mismatch between his traits and the typical professional interests and skills in that field.
