To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we'll make some reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch and the general relevance of his traits to the fields in question. The steps essentially come down to how well his described characteristics align with each field.

Given his interest in nature, animals, abstract concepts, empathy, and puzzle-solving, let's briefly consider how these traits might align with each field:

1. **Business Administration**: This field generally requires strong skills in leadership, management, strategic thinking, quantitative analysis, and communication. While Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work are relevant, his deep curiosity about nature and animals, along with his interest in solving puzzles, might not align perfectly with the main focus of a business administration curriculum. Thus, the probability for this field may be relatively low.

2. **Computer Science**: This field typically demands problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, intelligence, and occasionally an interest in applications that overlap with nature (e.g., bioinformatics) and empathy in designing user-friendly solutions. Adam's puzzle-solving skills, intelligence, and capability to understand abstract concepts make computer science a strong candidate.

Considering these alignments, let's provide the conditional probabilities based on the given sketch. Note that these probabilities are subjective estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These values reflect a reasonable assumption that Adam's personality traits are better aligned with computer science than business administration, though he could still feasibly be enrolled in either field.
