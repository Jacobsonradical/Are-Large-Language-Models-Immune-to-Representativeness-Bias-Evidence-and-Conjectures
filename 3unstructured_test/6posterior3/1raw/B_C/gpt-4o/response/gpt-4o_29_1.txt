Based on Adam's personality sketch, we need to compute the posterior conditional probability that he was enrolled in each specified field. Bayesian inference can help with this, but without specific prior probabilities or likelihoods for these fields, I can only offer qualitative reasoning.

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Business Administration:** This field tends to attract individuals who are often more extroverted, strategic, and interested in the commercial aspects of organizations. While Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant, his quiet nature, love for solving puzzles, deep empathy, and love for animals somewhat deflate the likelihood that business administration would be his chosen field.

2. **Computer Science (CS):** This field often attracts individuals who enjoy solving complex problems, have high intelligence, and are good at understanding abstract concepts. Adam's personality traits, such as enjoying puzzles and abstract thinking, align well with the characteristics of a typical computer science student. Additionally, his quiet nature and curiosity about nature might correlate with interests in fields like artificial intelligence or biological computation within CS.

Taking these qualitative assessments into account, here are the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Note: The probability values are heuristic and are meant to reflect the relative likelihood given the information, not exact computations from quantitative data.
