To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. While we lack precise prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can qualitatively infer probabilities based on the information provided.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Computer Science**: Adam has attributes that can align well with a computer science background. His curiosity about nature, high intelligence, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest an aptitude for technical and analytical fields. Computer science often requires solving complex problems and understanding abstract concepts.

- **Business Administration**: While Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work can be valuable in any field, the specific traits described (interest in nature, puzzles, and animals) don't strongly align with typical business administration interests. Therefore, the probability is lower.

Given only qualitative assessments, these probabilities reflect how closely his traits seem to match the characteristics commonly associated with those fields.
