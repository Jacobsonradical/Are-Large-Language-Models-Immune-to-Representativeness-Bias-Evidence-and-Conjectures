To determine the posterior conditional probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem, which requires some assumptions and prior probabilities. Given Adam's personality traits and interests, let's break down how these might align with the fields of computer science and business administration.

### Adam's Personality Traits:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants.
2. Quiet.
3. Enjoys solving puzzles.
4. Warm-hearted and empathetic.
5. Deep love for animals.
6. High intelligence.
7. Good understanding of abstract concepts.
8. Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Field Alignment:
**Computer Science:**
- Enjoys solving puzzles (aligns well with coding and algorithm design).
- High intelligence and good at abstract concepts are strong indicators for a field like computer science.
- Quiet personality can be common in introverted professions like coding.
- Genuine curiosity could apply to technology and problem-solving.
- Appreciation for hard work is important in computer science due to the level of focus needed.

**Business Administration:**
- Warm-hearted and empathetic could be favorable for leadership roles and human resources.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work are important in business administration.
- Business administration might not strongly align with his curiosity about nature and love for animals.
- Enjoys solving puzzles could relate to strategic business decisions, but less directly than in computer science.

Given these considerations, let's assign posterior probabilities based on how strongly Adam's traits align with each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

- **Computer Science (0.7)**: Adam's traits like enjoying puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and intellectual curiosity are highly pertinent to computer science.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While certain traits like warm-heartedness, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work would be beneficial in business administration, there seems to be less alignment overall with the core interests mentioned (such as curiosity about nature and love for animals). Thus, this field has a lower probability.

These probabilities are based on qualitative analysis of trait alignment rather than statistical data. If we had actual prior probabilities for these fields, we could provide more accurate numerical outputs.
