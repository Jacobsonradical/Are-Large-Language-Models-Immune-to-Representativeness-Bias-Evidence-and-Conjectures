To compute the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either Business Administration or Computer Science given his personality sketch, we'll use a qualitative approach based on his described attributes and interests. Given that we don't have specific prior probabilities or likelihood values, this analysis will be subjective.

Let's recall his key traits:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Now, let's analyze how these traits align with the fields in question:

### Business Administration:
- While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are beneficial, the other traits such as curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals are less directly aligned with the typical skills and interests of a Business Administration student.
- Business Administration often focuses more on leadership, management, economics, and organizational behavior, which are not explicitly mentioned in the sketch.

### Computer Science:
- Enjoying solving puzzles and having high intelligence and abstract thinking skills are highly relevant to Computer Science.
- While curiosity about nature and strong empathy are not core to Computer Science, they do not preclude someone from pursuing this field. Additionally, the increasing importance of ethics in AI and technology could attract someone with a warm heart and strong empathy.
- Deep love for animals is not directly related to Computer Science, but it doesn't conflict with it either.

Given this analysis, the posterior probability for each field, based on his traits, seems to favor Computer Science more than Business Administration. Here's the subjective probability distribution:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Note: These values are estimates based on qualitative alignment between Adam's personality traits and the typical demands/interests of the fields in question. For a more rigorous determination, one would need access to statistical data on student traits by discipline.
