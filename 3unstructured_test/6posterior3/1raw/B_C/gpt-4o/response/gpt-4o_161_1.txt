To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. However, to provide an accurate breakdown, we must be mindful that this estimation is qualitative as we lack specific base rate data on graduate student enrollments broken down by field and personality traits. Instead, we rely on plausibility based on his described characteristics.

Given the traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's briefly reason about each field:

1. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - Curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science.
   - Empathy and love for animals are less associated but do not preclude CS enrollment.

2. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication is important in business administration.
   - Empathy could be beneficial for management and HR roles but is less directly relevant to a standard BA program than logical problem-solving.

Given the reasoning:
- Computer Science benefits more directly from his analytical and abstract thinking skills.
- Business Administration could fit, but his specific curiosity about nature and solving puzzles feels more aligned with analytical fields.

Using these inferences, we can make a qualitative approximate guess:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

This reflects a higher likelihood that his traits align more with computer science, though there remains a reasonable chance for business administration given his appreciation for hard work and empathy, which are also valuable in that field.
