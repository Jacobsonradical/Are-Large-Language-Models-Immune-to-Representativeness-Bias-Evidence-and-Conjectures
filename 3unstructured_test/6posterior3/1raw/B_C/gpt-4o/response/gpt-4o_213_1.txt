To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration based on his personality sketch, we can use the principles of Bayesian probability. However, without explicit base rates (prior probabilities) for each field, this calculation will include a degree of subjective judgment.

Let's break it down:

### Given Personality Sketch Analysis:
1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Pros**: Curiosity about nature and various plants (interest in problem-solving), high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles. These traits align well with computer science.
   - **Cons**: Less direct information related to specific traits typically associated with computer science, like a strong inclination toward coding or technological problem-solving.
   
   Based on this, we can subjectively estimate Adam's probability of being in computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Pros**: Empathy and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant since good leadership and team management are important in business administration.
   - **Cons**: His deep love for nature and animals and interest in abstract concepts seem a bit less directly related to the core activities of business administration.

With these considerations, and in the absence of specific prior probabilities, a reasonable subjective estimate would look something like this:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

This estimate reflects a higher probability for computer science due to Adamâ€™s abstract thinking and problem-solving interests, which align better with traits commonly observed in that field. However, it also acknowledges that without knowing Adam's exact preferences and motivations, there is still a possibility, albeit smaller, for his enrollment in business administration.
