Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have an inclination towards fields that involve nature, animals, and solving puzzles. While business administration may not directly align with his interests and empathy towards nature, computer science could appeal to his high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts. Thus, it is more likely that he was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration, although there are other fields that might fit him even better.
