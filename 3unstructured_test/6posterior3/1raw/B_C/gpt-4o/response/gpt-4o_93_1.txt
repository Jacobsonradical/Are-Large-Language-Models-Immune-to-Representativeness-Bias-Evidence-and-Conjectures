To compute the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in one of these two fields given his personality sketch, we need to consider which aspects of his personality align with each field. This is a subjective task, but we can still make reasonable assumptions based on typical characteristics of individuals in these fields.

**Business Administration:**
- High intelligence
- Appreciation for the hard work and dedication

**Computer Science:**
- High intelligence
- Good at understanding abstract concepts
- Enjoys solving puzzles

Given that Adam has a deep love for animals, strong empathy, and a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, these traits do not strongly align with business administration or computer science. However, since being good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles is more directly aligned with computer science, this field might have a slightly higher posterior probability.

While this is a qualitative assessment, we will assign probabilities based on our reasoning:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```
