To evaluate the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in either Computer Science or Business Administration, given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits align with typical profiles of students in those fields.

Given attributes:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

**Computer Science:**
- Curiosity and puzzle-solving are highly aligned with computer science.
- High intelligence and abstract thinking are crucial in this field.
- While empathy and appreciation for nature are less directly relevant, they don't negatively impact candidacy.

**Business Administration:**
- Strong empathy, warm heart, and love for animals suggest strong interpersonal skills, a plus for business.
- Abstract thinking and intelligence are relevant but less central than empathy and people skills.
- Curiosity about nature and plants is not particularly relevant.

Based on these personality traits, Adam seems more aligned with the skill set required for Computer Science due to his intelligence, puzzle-solving capabilities, and abstract thinking. Although he has empathy and people skills beneficial for Business Administration, the strong alignment with typical Computer Science attributes marginally tips the scales.

Hence, the posterior probabilities could be approximated as:

{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.35
}

These values represent a higher likelihood for Computer Science but still consider the possibility of Business Administration given his personality traits.
