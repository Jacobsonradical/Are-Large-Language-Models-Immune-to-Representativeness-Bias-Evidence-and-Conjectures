Sure, I will make some assumptions based on general stereotypes and the information given in Adam's personality sketch to compute the posterior conditional probabilities in the fields of computer science and business administration.

Assumptions:
1. A high level of curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and a love for animals are more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration.
2. Intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving skills are attributes that are commonly associated with computer science.
3. An understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are traits that can be found in any field but tie well to business administration due in part to its rigor and competitive nature.
4. Quietness and empathy donâ€™t align particularly well with the stereotypically extroverted and often aggressive networking environment of business administration.

Given these assumptions:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with computer science. His quiet nature and empathy might not be directly relevant but don't contradict this field choice.

2. **Business Administration**: Although Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant, his empathy, love for animals, and quiet nature do not strongly align with the stereotypical traits of business administration graduates.

Keeping the above points in mind, here are the computed posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
These values reflect the likelihoods based on Adam's described personality traits matching more closely with computer science rather than business administration.
