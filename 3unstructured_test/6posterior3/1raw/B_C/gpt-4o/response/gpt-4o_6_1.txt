To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, Bayes' theorem is typically used. Bayes' theorem is stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of event A occurring given event B is true.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of event B given event A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event A.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of event B.

However, without concrete statistical data and probabilities, we can use qualitative reasoning to give a rough estimate for each field based on Adam's personality traits.

Given Adam's traits:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals.
- He is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has an appreciation for hard work and dedication.

**For Business Administration:**
- Curiosity about nature and plants is not strongly associated with business administration.
- Empathy and a warm heart might be moderately useful, as these could help in managing teams and understanding consumer needs, but they are not primary traits of this field.
- High intelligence and abstract thinking could be relevant (strategy, market analysis), but are generally more tangential.
- Puzzle-solving skills are somewhat relevant (analytical skills).
- Appreciation of hard work is relevant, but not specific enough.

**For Computer Science:**
- Enjoying solving puzzles is highly relevant (coding, algorithms, problem-solving).
- High intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts are very relevant.
- While empathy and a love for animals aren't directly relevant, they suggest a capacity for patience and thoughtful consideration, useful in collaborative tech environments.
- Appreciation of hard work and dedication is crucial in this field.

Based on qualitative intuition:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Here, the higher probability for computer science is due to the alignment of Adam's traits with the typical requirements and nature of the field. Business administration is less likely but not impossible, as some of his traits (intelligence, empathy, appreciation for hard work) could be beneficial.
