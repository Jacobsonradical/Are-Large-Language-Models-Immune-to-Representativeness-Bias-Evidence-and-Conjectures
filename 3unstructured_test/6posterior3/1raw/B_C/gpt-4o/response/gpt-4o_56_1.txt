To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we'll need to consider how well his traits align with the typical characteristics of students in these fields. We'll use Bayesian reasoning, but since we do not have the precise likelihoods and priors, we can make reasoned qualitative judgments to estimate these probabilities.

1. **Computer Science**: 

   - Adam's curiosity about nature and strong intelligence may align with some aspects of computer science, especially fields like artificial intelligence, computational biology, or environmental computing.
   - His ability to understand abstract concepts is a strong indicator for computer science, which often involves dealing with complex algorithms and data structures.
   - However, there's no specific mention of an interest in technology or programming, which are core to computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:

   - The personality traits do not strongly align with typical business administration characteristics. Those often involve leadership, interest in markets, finance, and organizational skills. 
   - Adam's warm heart, empathy, and love for animals might suggest a preference for more compassionate or science-oriented fields rather than the competitive nature of business.

Given these considerations, the estimated probabilities would look like this:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These values are subjective estimates based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with what is typically expected in these fields. The higher value for computer science reflects his alignment with abstract thinking and problem-solving, but it's still relatively low due to the lack of specific interest in computing. The business administration probability is lower due to the mismatch of traits like empathy and a love for animals with typical business characteristics.
