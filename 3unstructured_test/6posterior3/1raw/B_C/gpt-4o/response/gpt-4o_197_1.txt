To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam's enrollment in the given fields given his personality sketch, we need to consider his traits and how they align with the typical characteristics valued in each field.

Let's first summarize the key traits from Adam's personality sketch:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants
2. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
3. Warm-hearted, strong empathy
4. Deep love for animals
5. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
6. Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

### Computer Science:
- **Alignment with Adam's traits:**
  - Enjoying solving puzzles aligns well with computer science.
  - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are crucial in computer science.
  - A quiet and introspective nature can be common in people who excel in programming and algorithm development.
  
- **Discrepancy:**
  - While a genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals isn't directly related to computer science, these traits don't necessarily conflict with it either.

### Business Administration:
- **Alignment with Adam's traits:**
  - Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant in business.
  - Empathy can be an asset in managing teams and understanding consumer behavior.
  
- **Discrepancy:**
  - Business administration often requires strong extrovert traits and social skills for networking and leadership, which aren't highlighted in Adam's personality.
  - A quiet nature and love for animals and nature may not align as closely with the typical traits seen in business administration.

Given this analysis, it seems more probable that Adam's personality sketch aligns better with computer science than business administration.

Let's assign a rough value based on this qualitative assessment:

- Computer Science: Given the alignment with key traits like puzzle-solving, abstract reasoning, and a quiet nature, I would assign a reasonably high probability.
- Business Administration: Given the less direct alignment with Adam's traits and possible mismatches in terms of personality fit, I would assign a lower probability.

Based on these considerations:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are intuitive estimates reflecting how well Adam's personality traits align with typical expectations in each field.
