To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in specific fields given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. While we don't have the precise prior probabilities or likelihoods for each field, we can make qualitative inferences based on the provided information:

**Personality Traits and Interest:**
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: This trait isn’t typically associated with business administration or computer science.
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: This trait is more aligned with computer science.
- Strong empathy and deep love for animals: This trait doesn’t strongly correlate with either field.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: This trait is crucial for both fields but is particularly emphasized in computer science.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: This trait applies broadly and may not significantly differentiate between the fields.

Given these traits, Adam's personality and interests seem to align more closely with computer science rather than business administration, especially considering his enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts.

Thus, the posterior probability values could be roughly estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.8
}
```
This estimation suggests that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration. However, it is important to note that these values are not precise and are based on qualitative assessment rather than quantitative data.
