To answer this question using Bayesian inference, we would ideally need prior distributions and likelihoods for different personality traits given specific fields of study. In the absence of explicit statistical data, we will make educated assumptions based on common associations between personality traits and fields of study.

For both business administration and computer science, consider these points related to Adam's personality and each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Not particularly associated.
   - **Solving puzzles**: Somewhat relevant.
   - **Warm heart and strong empathy**: Somewhat relevant, especially in HR or management roles.
   - **Love for animals**: Not particularly associated.
   - **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: Relevant but general.
   - **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Highly relevant.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Not particularly associated.
   - **Solving puzzles**: Highly relevant, aligns well with problem-solving in coding and algorithms.
   - **Warm heart and strong empathy**: Not particularly associated with the technical nature of the field.
   - **Love for animals**: Not particularly associated.
   - **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: Highly relevant, given the complexity of theoretical aspects.
   - **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Highly relevant, as the field demands perseverance and strong analytical skills.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can make the following educated guesses:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

These values reflect that Adam's inclination towards problem-solving and high intelligence align more strongly with computer science, while his other traits are somewhat less specifically aligned with business administration.
