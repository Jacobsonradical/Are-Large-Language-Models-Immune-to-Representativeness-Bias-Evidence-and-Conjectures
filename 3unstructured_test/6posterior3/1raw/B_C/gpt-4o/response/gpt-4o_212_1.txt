To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we use Bayes' Theorem. However, for qualitative descriptions like this, exact numerical probabilities aren't always easily derivable without specific empirical data. Instead, we can offer an informed estimation based on the given details about Adam's personality and interests. 

Given Adam's personality sketch, here are some considerations:
- His genuine curiosity about nature and various plants suggests a strong interest in natural sciences.
- Being a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles aligns well with fields that involve analytical thinking, such as science and engineering.
- His attributes like strong empathy and a deep love for animals lean more towards fields that may involve biology, environmental science, or any field with a focus on sustainability.
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are certainly advantageous in almost any graduate field, particularly those requiring rigorous analytical skills.

Given this background, we can make rough estimates:

Business Administration:
- Business administration typically involves leadership, management skills, and human interaction, which does not directly align with the more nature-oriented and analytical aspects of Adam's profile. Thus, the likelihood (posterior probability) that Adam is enrolled in business administration may be lower.

Computer Science:
- Computer science involves problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, and often involves self-driven, introspective work, which matches several facets of Adam's attributes well. Therefore, the likelihood of Adam being in this field may be higher than business administration, though perhaps not the highest compared to fields directly related to his love for nature and animals.

Given these considerations, here's a qualitative estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values reflect the relatively lower probability of Adam being in business administration and a moderate probability of being in computer science, given the provided personality sketch. It should be noted that exact values are highly dependent on further context and empirical data, which are not provided here.
