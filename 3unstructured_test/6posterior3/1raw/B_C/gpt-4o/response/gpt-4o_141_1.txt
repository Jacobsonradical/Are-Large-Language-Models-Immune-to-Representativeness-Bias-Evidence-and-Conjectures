{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

To explain the reasoning behind these probabilities:

- Business Administration: The field generally emphasizes skills such as leadership, management, and decision-making. While Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work could be assets in this field, the sketch heavily features his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, which are less directly relevant to business administration. Thus, the probability is relatively low.

- Computer Science: This field often values high intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts, both of which are highlighted in Adam's sketch. His enjoyment of solving puzzles is also a good fit for computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals, as well as his empathy, are not as typically synonymous with the stereotypical traits associated with computer science students, leading to a moderately low probability but higher than business administration.
