Given Adam's personality traits and interests, computer science seems a more likely field compared to business administration. His appreciation for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with the analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science. Additionally, his high intelligence and curiosity suggest he would be attracted to the challenges in this field.

On the other hand, while business administration might require intelligence and dedication, it doesn't distinctly align with Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and puzzles. Hence, the probability for business administration is lower.
