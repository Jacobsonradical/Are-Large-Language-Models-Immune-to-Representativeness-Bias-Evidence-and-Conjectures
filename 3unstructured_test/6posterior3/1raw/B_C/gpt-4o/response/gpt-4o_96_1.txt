To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam's field of study, we can use Bayesian reasoning. Let’s denote:

- \( P(F | S) \): Probability Adam was in field \( F \) given personality sketch \( S \)
- \( P(S | F) \): Probability of personality sketch \( S \) given field \( F \)
- \( P(F) \): Prior probability of field \( F \)
- \( P(S) \): Normalizing constant

However, since exact priors and likelihoods are not provided, we'll make reasonable qualitative judgments based on Adam's personality sketch.

Given the sketch, Adam seems to have traits more aligned with natural sciences and possibly computer science rather than business administration, given his intelligence, curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for solving puzzles. We will assume:

- \( P(S | \text{business administration}) \) is low because his traits don’t strongly align with typical business student characteristics.
- \( P(S | \text{computer science}) \) is higher because puzzles and abstract concepts align well with computer science.

Here’s a qualitative Bayesian reasoning computation for the probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,  // Low probability given the sketch's alignment
  "computer science": 0.5  // Higher probability as his personality aligns well with CS traits
}

The exact numerical values are subjective but reflect the qualitative fit of Adam’s personality with each field.
