Explanation:
Given Adam's personality traits, some fields are more likely than others. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest he may be inclined towards fields that involve understanding and working with living things or abstract concepts rather than business management. Also, his high intelligence and problem-solving skills are very relevant to computer science, which is often chosen by individuals with a strong aptitude for abstract thinking and puzzles. Business administration does not directly connect as well with his traits of empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature. Thus, the posterior conditional probability is higher for computer science than for business administration.
