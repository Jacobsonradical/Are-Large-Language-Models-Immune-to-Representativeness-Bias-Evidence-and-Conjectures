To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we'll employ Bayesian inference. This involves considering two main factors: the base rate (prior probability) of students enrolled in each field, and how well Adam's characteristics align with typical students in those fields (likelihood).

Let's break it down:

1. **Base rates (P(A)):** These are general probabilities in the population of graduate students. For instance, the number of students in each field out of the total number of graduate students.

2. **Likelihood (P(B|A)):** This is how likely someone with Adam’s set of characteristics would choose that field.

3. **Posterior probability (P(A|B)):** This is what we want to compute – the probability that Adam is in a specific field given his characteristics.

While exact values can be derived from more detailed data, here I'll provide a qualitative estimation based on his personality sketch and typical profiles of students in these fields.

**Assumptions:**
- There are some base rate approximations we can use:
  - Higher enrollment in Business Administration programs compared to Computer Science programs.
  - However, more personality alignment factors might be supportive in one field compared to the other.

### Posterior Probability Computation
Given Adam's characteristics:
- High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: these fit well for both computer science and business administration.
- Genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals: tilts more towards fields related to computer science, especially areas like bioinformatics, environmental computing, or scientific computing.
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles: these are typically associated with computer science students more than business administration.
- Strong empathy, warm-hearted: these traits are generally more emphasized in business administration (especially in roles needing management and people interaction) but can also be relevant in cooperative tech roles.

#### Heuristically:
1. **Computer Science:** Given the noted traits like puzzle-solving, intelligence, abstract thinking, there would be a relatively higher alignment.
2. **Business Administration:** Strong empathy, appreciation for hard work, warm-hearted nature align well, though his preference for tranquility and puzzles is less emphasized.

Let’s provide a simplified, qualitative posterior probability given the well-rounded alignment in both fields but a tilt due to specific defining characteristics:
