To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each given field based on his personality sketch, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability of Adam being in a particular field given his personality.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of Adam's personality characteristics given that he is in that particular field.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability of Adam being in that particular field.
- \(P(B)\) is the overall probability of Adam's personality characteristics.

Given we don't have specific prior probabilities, we will assume equal priors among all possible graduate fields. We'll focus primarily on \(P(B|A)\) which represents likelihood and qualitatively assess how much Adam's personality fits within each field.

### Business Administration
1. **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Not particularly aligned; interest is typically in business operations, management, etc.
2. **Solving puzzles**: Somewhat relevant for strategic thinking, but not a primary aspect.
3. **Warm heart, empathy, love for animals**: Not strongly relevant to business goals.
4. **High intelligence, abstract concepts**: Relevant but not unique to business administration.
5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Relevant as business requires dedication.

Overall, likelihood \(P(B|A)\): Low to moderate.

### Computer Science
1. **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Somewhat aligned with bioinformatics, but not core.
2. **Solving puzzles**: Highly relevant, as problem-solving is central to computer science.
3. **Warm heart, empathy, love for animals**: Not typically relevant, although good team skills are valued.
4. **High intelligence, abstract concepts**: Highly relevant, as computer science involves complex and abstract thinking.
5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Relevant as the field requires rigorous effort.

Overall, likelihood \(P(B|A)\): Moderate to high.

Based on this qualitative assessment, we suggest higher probability for Computer Science compared to Business Administration given Adam's personality sketch.

Note: These probabilities are relative and not absolute, assuming equal prior likelihood for all potential graduate fields. Further adjusting priors or adding other specific fields could refine these values.
