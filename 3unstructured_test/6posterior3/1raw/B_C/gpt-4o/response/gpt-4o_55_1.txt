To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to analyze how well Adam's personality traits match the general profiles of students in each field, then assign probabilities accordingly. Here's the qualitative reasoning for the estimates:

### Business Administration
- **Typical Traits**: Often associated with people who are outgoing, assertive, and interested in leadership, entrepreneurship, and organizational management.
- **Matching with Adam**:
  - Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: Doesn't strongly align with typical business administration traits.
  - Empathy and understanding: Some alignment as emotional intelligence can be valuable in business.
  - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work: This is a relevant trait but not sufficient on its own.

Given that only a few of Adam's traits align with business administration,

### Computer Science
- **Typical Traits**: Often associated with people who enjoy solving problems, have a strong interest in abstract concepts, and may prefer working in quieter environments.
- **Matching with Adam**:
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: Strongly aligns with computer science, which often involves problem-solving and logic.
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Strongly aligns with computer science.
  - Quiet and deep love for animals: While not direct indicators, they are not in conflict with a computer science profile.
  - Strong empathy: Less common in the stereotype, but not contradictory.
  - Appreciation for hard work: Relevant, as computer science can be demanding.

Given that most of Adam's traits align well with the profile of a computer science student,

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.8
}
```

These probabilities are subjective estimates based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the typical profiles in these fields.
