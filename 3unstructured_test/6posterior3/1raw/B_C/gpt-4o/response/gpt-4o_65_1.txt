To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we need to consider how Adam's characteristics align with the typical traits and interests of students in each field. 

### Analysis:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Neutral or weakly correlated.
   - **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Strongly correlated with computer science (problem-solving).
   - **Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals**: Weakly correlated, as these traits are not typical indicators of computer science interest.
   - **High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts**: Strongly correlated.
   - **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Correlated but not uniquely so.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Weakly correlated.
   - **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Neutral or weakly correlated.
   - **Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals**: Neutral to moderately correlated, as empathy can be an asset in business settings.
   - **High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts**: Positively correlated, but thereâ€™s a higher concentration in fields like finance.
   - **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Strongly correlated.

These correlations highlight that the traits Adam exhibits are more strongly aligned with the characteristics of a computer science student. While his empathy and love for animals don't particularly align with computer science, those traits do not detract significantly because they can be found in individuals in any field.

### Computation:

Given no base rates and only the description to work from, we can make an educated guess:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

The probabilities do not sum to 1, as there could be other fields that Adam might be in, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology, which might also fit his profile quite well.
