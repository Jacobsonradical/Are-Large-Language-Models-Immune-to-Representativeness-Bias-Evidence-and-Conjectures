To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration based on his personality traits, we apply Bayes' theorem. However, without explicit prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can't compute exact probabilities. Instead, we can qualitatively assess these fields based on his personality traits.

Given Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoyable puzzle-solving, implying analytical thinking
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

### Computer Science
- Analytical thinking and puzzle-solving align well with computer science.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are crucial in computer science.
- Appreciation for hard work is beneficial in this field.
- Empathy and love for nature are less directly related but don't preclude an interest in this field.

### Business Administration
- Warm heart and empathy are essential in business administration for team and client relations.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are also useful.
- Genuine curiosity about nature and animals is less directly related.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is universally beneficial.

Here's a qualitative guess based on the alignment of traits:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.35
}
```

These values reflect a slightly higher posterior probability for computer science due to the alignment with Adam's analytical and abstract thinking skills, despite strong empathy and nature curiosity fitting well in niches of business administration.
