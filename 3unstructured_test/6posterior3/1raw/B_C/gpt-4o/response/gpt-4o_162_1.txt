To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science based on his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits and interests align with the typical characteristics of students in these fields. Given the qualitative nature of the analysis, we'll use a heuristic approach.

### Analysis:

#### Business Administration:
- Interest in nature and plants: Not typically associated.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles: Marginal relevance.
- Warm heart, strong empathy: Can be relevant but not a primary trait.
- Love for animals: No direct relevance.
- High intelligence: Relevant but not exclusive.
- Understanding abstract concepts: Relevant but not exclusive.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Strongly relevant.

#### Computer Science:
- Interest in nature and plants: Not typically associated.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles: Highly relevant.
- Warm heart, strong empathy: Not typically associated.
- Love for animals: No direct relevance.
- High intelligence: Highly relevant.
- Understanding abstract concepts: Highly relevant.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Strongly relevant.

Considering these points, Adam's personality seems to significantly align more with computer science, especially due to his enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts.

### Computation (Heuristic Approach):
Given Adam's strong alignment with computer science characteristics, we will assign higher probabilities accordingly.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,  // Considering the aspect of hard work and dedication.
  "computer science": 0.7    // Considering alignment with enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts.
}
```

Note that these values are heuristic estimates based on qualitative traits and patterns commonly observed in these fields.
