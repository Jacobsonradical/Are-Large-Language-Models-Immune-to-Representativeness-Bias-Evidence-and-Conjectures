To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' theorem. However, without prior probabilities or specific numerical values for the likelihoods, we need to rely on the qualitative match between Adam's characteristics and the typical traits of students in these fields.

Here we evaluate the fit of Adam's personality traits with computer science and business administration:

1. **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals who are good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. High intelligence and curiosity about complex systems are also valuable. Adamâ€™s quiet nature and empathy might be less common but are not detrimental.

2. **Business Administration**: This field typically attracts individuals who appreciate hard work and dedication. While empathy and a warm heart are valuable traits, this field usually favors individuals who are more outgoing and focused on leadership and managerial skills. 

Given the qualitative match between Adam's traits and the typical student profiles for these fields, we can make a rough estimation of the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect a greater alignment with computer science due to Adam's strengths in problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence, while his personality is less aligned with the commonly more extroverted nature of business administration students.
