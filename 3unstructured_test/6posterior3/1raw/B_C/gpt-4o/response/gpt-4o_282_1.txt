To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to combine Adam's personality traits with a general sense of what fields are likely to attract individuals with those traits. Bayesian reasoning often involves starting with priors (general probabilities of being in those fields) but since these are not specified, we'll assume uniform priors and focus more on fit with personality traits.

Firstly, let's analyze the fit:

1. **Computer Science:**
    - High intelligence and abstract thinking fit well with computer science.
    - Enjoyment of puzzles is also a good indicator.
    - While a love for nature and animals isn't directly related, it doesn't exclude computer science.

2. **Business Administration:**
    - Business administration could align with a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as understanding complex systems.
    - However, given the more technical and analytical nature of his interests and empathy for animals, this field seems less aligned compared to computer science.

Given these alignments, here is a reasonable estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values balance Adam's specific traits and interests, somewhat favoring computer science due to the direct alignment with intelligence, problem-solving, and abstract thinking.
