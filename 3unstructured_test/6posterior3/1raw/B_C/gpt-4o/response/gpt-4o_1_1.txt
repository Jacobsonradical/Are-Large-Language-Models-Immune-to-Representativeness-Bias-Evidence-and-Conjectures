Given Adam's personality sketch, we can consider the likelihood of certain key attributes fitting within the given fields. Here's a preliminary analysis for each field based on the provided sketch:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - **Curiosity about nature and plants:**
     - Not particularly relevant but not entirely exclusive of business interests.
   - **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles:**
     - Might be less common but not absent in business fields.
   - **Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals:**
     - Might align with fields like non-profit management or social entrepreneurship, but generally not a core trait for business administration.
   - **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts:**
     - Relevant, as abstract thinking is valued in strategic aspects of business.
   - **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:**
     - Highly relevant.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - **Curiosity about nature and plants:**
     - Not directly relevant but not exclusive.
   - **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles:**
     - Highly relevant, as problem-solving is core to computer science.
   - **Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals:**
     - While not typically associated, it doesn’t disqualify someone from this field.
   - **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts:**
     - Very relevant, as computer science involves significant abstract and complex thinking.
   - **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:**
     - Highly relevant.

Given that Adam's profile includes strong problem-solving skills, a high appreciation for abstract concepts, and a quiet demeanor—all of which are essential traits for a computer science graduate student—the likelihood seems higher for computer science than business administration. Although his empathy and love for animals don't directly align with traditional computer science, they don't preclude it either.

Here's an educated estimation of the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

While these are estimated probabilities, they reflect the fit between Adam's characteristics and the typical demands and nature of these fields.
