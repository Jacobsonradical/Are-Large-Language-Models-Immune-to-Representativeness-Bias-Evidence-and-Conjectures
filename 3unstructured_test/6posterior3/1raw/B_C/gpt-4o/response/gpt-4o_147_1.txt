To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we will have to make some subjective assessments based on the provided information. The Bayes' theorem framework would typically require prior probabilities and likelihoods, but we don’t have specific data points here. Therefore, we’ll make logically sound estimates.

1. **Business Administration**: 
   - Business is typically more about dealing with people, management, and administration processes, rather than solving abstract puzzles or focusing on nature.
   - Considering Adam's love for nature, animals, empathy, and abstract thinking, it seems less likely he would be in a field that heavily involves business operations.
   
2. **Computer Science**:
   - Computer Science often involves solving puzzles, which aligns well with Adam's enjoyment in that area.
   - It also requires high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which fits well with his described capabilities.
   - However, it doesn’t directly tap into his love for nature and animals unless he’s specializing in something like bioinformatics or environmental modeling.

Given these factors:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values reflect the alignment of Adam's interests and skills with what is typically expected in each field. The significantly lower probability for business administration reflects a lower alignment with his described personality traits, while the moderate probability for computer science reflects a reasonable alignment with many of his traits, especially those related to problem-solving and abstract thinking.
