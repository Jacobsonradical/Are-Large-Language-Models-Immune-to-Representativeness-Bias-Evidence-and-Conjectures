To calculate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a certain field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' rule in a subjective, qualitative manner. However, we lack the exact base rates (prior probabilities) of graduate students in these fields in 2021, making it difficult to compute precise numerical values. Instead, we can provide an approximate qualitative assessment based on the descriptive elements.

Let's evaluate the likelihood based on Adam's traits:

- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts suggest a capability for studies requiring high cognitive skills.
- His genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, as well as a deep love for animals, suggests a possible alignment with biological or environmental sciences but not explicitly computer science or business.
- Solving puzzles and abstract thinking may align well with computer science.
- Strong empathy and warm heart suggest a good fit for fields involving interpersonal interactions but are less explicitly matched to computer science or business administration as typically framed.

Given these considerations, I will provide a qualitative guess. 

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values suggest that based on the given personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be aligned with fields working closely with nature and abstract thinking rather than pure business or computing, although his intelligence makes computer science a fair possibility.
