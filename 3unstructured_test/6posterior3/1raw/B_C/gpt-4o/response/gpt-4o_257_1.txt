Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood of him being in each field can be estimated based on his interests and traits. Here’s a breakdown of how his characteristics align with each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Typical traits: Leadership, extroversion, business acumen, strategic thinking.
   - Adam's traits: Curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, warm-hearted, empathetic, loves animals, high intelligence, appreciates hard work and dedication.
   - Match: Low. While intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant, Adam's empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not strongly align with the typical traits for business administration.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Typical traits: Logical thinking, problem-solving, interest in abstract concepts, introversion (often), intelligence, focus on technology.
   - Adam's traits: Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, quiet nature.
   - Match: High. Adam’s enjoyment of puzzles, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science, and his quiet nature is not uncommon either.

Based on these alignments, the posterior conditional probabilities might look like this:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood for Adam being enrolled in computer science given his personality traits, as compared to business administration. The values are approximations and should be adjusted based on more precise data if available.
