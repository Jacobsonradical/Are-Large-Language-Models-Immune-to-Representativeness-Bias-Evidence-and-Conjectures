To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's the process:

1. **Prior probabilities (P(Computer Science) and P(Business Administration)):**
   - These represent the likelihood of a graduate student being in each field, assuming no knowledge of Adam's personality. We'll approximate these with some general data.
   - Letâ€™s assume from general admissions data that the proportion of graduate students in computer science is around 20%, and for business administration, it's around 10%.

   So, \( P(\text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.2 \)
   and \( P(\text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihoods (P(Personality | Computer Science) and P(Personality | Business Administration)):**
   - We assess how likely it is that a person with the given personality traits would be in each field:

   - For computer science:
     - High intelligence: common in CS
     - Good at understanding abstract concepts: common in CS
     - Enjoys solving puzzles: common in CS
     - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work: common in CS
   - For business administration:
     - Strong empathy: useful but not field-specific
     - Warm heart: useful but not field-specific
     - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work: common in both fields

   Based on these assessments, we estimate:
   \( P(\text{Personality} | \text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.6 \)
   \( P(\text{Personality} | \text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.3 \)

3. **Normalization (Evidence):**
   - To compare these, we need to normalize by the total probability of observing the personality across all fields.
   - This is difficult without more precise data, so we'll simply be comparing the relative likelihood ratios.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Personality}) = \frac{P(\text{Personality} | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Personality})} \]

\[ P(\text{Business Administration} | \text{Personality}) = \frac{P(\text{Personality} | \text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(\text{Personality})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Personality}) \) is common in the denominator for both:

\[ \text{Relative probabilities} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{P(\text{Personality})} \text{ and } \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{P(\text{Personality})} \]

\[ \frac{P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Personality})}{P(\text{Business Administration} | \text{Personality})} = \frac{0.12}{0.03} = 4 \]

This means Adam is four times more likely to be in computer science than in business administration.

Putting this into a normalized form (keeping the sum of these normalized conditional probabilities somewhat proportional):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values indicate a higher likelihood for computer science given the traits described. Note that these are rough estimates based on qualitative assessments and assumed prior probabilities.
