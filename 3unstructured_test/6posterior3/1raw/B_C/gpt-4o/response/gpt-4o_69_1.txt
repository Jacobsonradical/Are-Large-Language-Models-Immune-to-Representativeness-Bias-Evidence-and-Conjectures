To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we should use Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific base rates (prior probabilities) for each field and how likely each personality trait is given each field (likelihoods), we can only provide an educated estimate based on the provided details.

Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, is highly intelligent, and understands abstract concepts, it seems more plausible for him to be suited to fields that highly value such analytical and intellectual traits. 

Computer Science:
- Enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
- High intelligence is a good fit for computer science.
- Quiet demeanor may match well with focused, independent work common in this field.

Business Administration:
- His strong empathy and warm heart can be beneficial.
- Business administration would require strong interpersonal and communication skills, which are not explicitly highlighted in the sketch.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is definitely valuable, but his personality might be more fitting for analytical than managerial roles.

Taking these points into consideration and making an educated guess:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Please note these values are speculative and would ideally be informed by more specific data related to graduate field distributions and personality fits.
