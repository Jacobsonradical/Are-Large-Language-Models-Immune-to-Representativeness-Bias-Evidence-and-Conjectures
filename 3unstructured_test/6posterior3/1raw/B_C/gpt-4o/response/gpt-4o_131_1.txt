To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science based on his personality sketch, we'll use Bayesian reasoning. While we can't compute precise numerical probabilities without more specific data, we can provide qualitative estimates.

Given the information, let's break down the key points of Adam's personality sketch and how they relate to each field:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants: This trait suggests an interest in natural sciences, which doesn't directly support business administration or computer science more strongly.
   
2. Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles: This is a strong indicator of an aptitude for computer science, as problem-solving is a core component of the field.
   
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals: These traits might be less directly aligned with either field; however, they are generally more indicative of humanities or social sciences than hard sciences or business.
   
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: This trait aligns well with computer science, which often requires high-level abstract thinking and intelligence.
   
5. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: This is a general trait that could be applicable to any field, including both business administration and computer science.

To summarize, Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align more closely with computer science than business administration. His empathy and love for animals do not strongly favor either field but might slightly lean away from business due to its often competitive nature.

Based on this qualitative assessment, we can roughly estimate the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

Note that these values are heuristic and meant to reflect the stronger alignment of Adamâ€™s personality traits with computer science than with business administration.
