To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of A occurring given B is true, \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of B occurring given A is true, \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A, and \( P(B) \) is the prior probability of B. However, we do not have specific numerical data on the priors (such as the overall distribution of students in different fields), hence the following analysis is qualitative.

### Analysis Based on Adam's Personality Sketch

**Computer Science:**
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators for computer science.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles is also a characteristic often associated with computer science and programming.
- Empathy and a love for nature do not strongly point toward or away from computer science but might be less emphasized in this field.
  
**Business Administration:**
- While empathy and understanding of hard work are important traits for business administration, the other interests (nature, plants, animals, solving puzzles) do not strongly align with typical business administration traits.
- Business administration may value strong interpersonal skills and focus on human and organizational behavior which are not emphasized here.

Based on this qualitative assessment, Adamâ€™s personality sketch seems more aligned with computer science compared to business administration.

### Estimation

Given the above reasoning, the posterior probabilities might be estimated as follows (remember these are estimations based on qualitative assessment):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Please note that this estimation does not involve numerical calculations as specific data is not provided, and it relies heavily on qualitative matching of personality traits to common field characteristics. The remaining probability (0.1) could be attributed to other fields not specified here. For more precision, actual data on the distribution of personality traits across fields and prior probabilities of students enrolling in these fields would be required.
