To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, let's consider how well his traits align with the typical attributes needed for success in each of these fields. We will employ qualitative reasoning rather than quantitative methods due to the nature of the provided information.

### Key Aspects of Adam's Personality:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

### Fields of Specialization:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **Typical Traits Needed**: Leadership, strategic thinking, communication skills, interpersonal relation skills, networking.
   - **Alignment with Adam's Traits**: Adam's strong empathy and understanding of hard work could be beneficial in managing teams and understanding employees. However, his quiet nature and love for nature and animals suggest a lower alignment with a field typically focused on human interactions and high-stress decision-making environments.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **Typical Traits Needed**: Problem-solving skills, attention to detail, mathematical ability, abstract and logical thinking, often (but not always) less emphasis on interpersonal skills.
   - **Alignment with Adam's Traits**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and good understanding of abstract concepts. These traits are highly aligned with the skills needed for computer science. Additionally, his quiet nature might find solace in the more solitary and logical work environment that computer science can offer.

Given this qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect that, based on Adam's personality sketch, there is a higher probability that he is enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
