To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we need to indirectly use Bayes' Theorem. However, we can only approximate given the qualitative information provided.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals, certain fields seem more aligned with his personality traits. While this doesn't provide us with exact data, we can make educated guesses based on the typical characteristics and interests of individuals in different academic fields.

For Computer Science:
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles.
- He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.

For Business Administration:
- There is less direct evidence in his personality sketch that aligns strongly with typical business qualities (e.g., leadership, a focus on profitability, business strategy).

Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems more naturally inclined towards fields that require analytical thinking and problem-solving, which aligns more with computer science.

Here is an estimated probability distribution:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

This estimation is purely qualitative; it assumes that Adam's personality traits strongly align with fields like computer science but less with business administration.
