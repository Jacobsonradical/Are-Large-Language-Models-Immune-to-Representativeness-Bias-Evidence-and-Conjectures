To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we need to employ Bayesian reasoning. This involves applying Bayes' theorem and utilizing available evidence related to the traits and interests described.

The personality sketch emphasizes Adam’s curiosity about nature, his interest in plants and animals, and his intelligence and empathy. We can derive the likelihoods of these traits correlating with particular fields of graduate study.

1. **Business Administration** - Generally involves the study of management, economics, and entrepreneurship. While intelligence and empathy are relevant here for leadership and team dynamics, the strong appeal to nature, plants, and animals is less directly relevant.
2. **Computer Science** - Involves understanding abstract concepts, solving puzzles, and logical thinking. Given Adam’s traits of intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, this field appears to suit his profile better, although the aspect of nature is less emphasized.

Bearing in mind that we should not solely rely on these traits for precise numeric values without empirical data, we can make inferential estimates. Hence, reasonable estimates for the probabilities might be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

The probabilities reflect that Adam's personality and interests align more closely with computer science, due to his penchant for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, though without data, these values remain estimative. Further inference would ideally rely on empirical statistical distributions from graduate program demographics that align personality traits to academic fields.
