To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in its general form is:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the posterior probability of event A occurring given B.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the likelihood of observing B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event A.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of observing B.

Here's the interpretation in our context:
- \( A \) represents the event of Adam being in a specific field (e.g., business administration or computer science).
- \( B \) represents the personality traits and information provided about Adam.

We need to consider how well Adam's personality aligns with typical students in each field, based on our prior understanding.

1. **Business Administration**
   - Likelihood: Business administration typically involves strong interpersonal skills, interest in leadership, management, strategy, and making data-driven decisions. Adam's traits such as curiosity, empathy, and appreciation for hard work might be somewhat relevant, but his stronger inclination towards nature, puzzles, and animals may not directly align with common interests in this field.
   - Prior Probability: Business administration is a popular graduate field, so the prior probability is relatively high.
   
2. **Computer Science**
   - Likelihood: Computer science requires high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, problem-solving skills, and often a quiet, methodical nature. These are strongly aligned with Adamâ€™s personality traits such as enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts.
   - Prior Probability: Computer science is also a very popular and broad field in graduate studies, so the prior probability is also relatively high.

Considering these, we can roughly estimate the probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values suggest that it is more likely for Adam to be studying computer science than business administration based on the given personality sketch. The personality traits, particularly his enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, are more aligned with what is typically seen in computer science students, making it a higher probability field for him compared to business administration.
