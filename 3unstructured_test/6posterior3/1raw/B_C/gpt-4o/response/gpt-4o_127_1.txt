To provide the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to make some reasonable assumptions about the likelihood of someone with Adam's traits pursuing each field. 

However, please note that this is a subjective estimation exercise and the answers should be taken with a grain of caution. The calculation here is heuristic and does not follow from a detailed statistical analysis.

Let's break it down:
1. Computer Science: Adam has high intelligence, is good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles, and appreciates hard work and dedication. These traits align well with the demands of a computer science program. 
2. Business Administration: While Adam's empathy, warm heart, appreciation for hard work, and dedication are relevant, his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and tendency to be quiet are less directly correlated with the stereotypical skills and interests associated with business administration programs.

Given these considerations, I would estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for each field as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are heuristic approximations and are reflective of the direct connection between Adam's traits and the typical skill sets and interests that align with each field. Additional information and statistical data would be required for a precise calculation.
