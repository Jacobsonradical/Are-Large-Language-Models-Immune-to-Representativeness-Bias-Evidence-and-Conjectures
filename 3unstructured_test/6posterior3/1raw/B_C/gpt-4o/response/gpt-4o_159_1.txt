To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian inference qualitatively.

Here's how it might look:

1. **Business Administration:** Individuals in business administration are typically expected to have strong interpersonal skills, leadership qualities, and a keen interest in business, economics, and management. Adam's personality sketch indicates he has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, which are qualities often suited to human and social sciences but not specifically oriented towards business. The characteristics like a genuine curiosity about nature, quiet demeanor, and love for solving puzzles and abstract concepts are less indicative of a typical business administration student.

2. **Computer Science:** People in computer science often have strong logical reasoning, love for solving complex problems, and an interest in abstract and theoretical concepts. Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment in solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills valuable in computer science. His genuine curiosity about nature and plants can also align with a scientific mindset, though maybe not directly related to computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, Adam's personality sketch seems to align more closely with the traits desirable in a computer science graduate student than those typically associated with business administration. 

Here is a qualitative estimate of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the higher likelihood that Adam's personality fits a computer science program rather than a business administration program, based on the given sketch.
