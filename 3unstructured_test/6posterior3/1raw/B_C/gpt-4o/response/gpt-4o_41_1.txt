To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we utilize Bayes' Theorem in a conceptual manner. Since we are dealing with a qualitative description and not actual probabilistic data, the exact numerical probability requires subjective judgment and can be approximate.

Here's the information discussed:

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. He is a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Adam has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
4. He is of high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Analysis:
- **Computer Science**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and abstract concepts align closely with skills in computer science. Computer science often involves logical problem-solving, abstract thinking, and analytical skills, all of which are mentioned in Adamâ€™s personality sketch.

- **Business Administration**: The field generally requires strong interpersonal skills, leadership qualities, and an interest in management and organizational behavior. While Adam's empathy and warm heart can be beneficial in a management or HR role within business administration, his strong lean towards nature, animals, and abstract-concept solving does not explicitly align with typical business administration traits.

Given this qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's aptitudes and preferences indicated in the personality sketch are more closely aligned with the fields and activities typically associated with computer science than business administration.
