To determine the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration or Computer Science, based on his personality sketch, we need to employ Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities and a detailed likelihood function for each field, we can't provide exact numerical values. Instead, we'll make a reasoned assessment using qualitative analysis.

Adam's strong empathy, love for nature and animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work suggest certain inclinations that might make him more or less likely to enroll in specific fields. Hereâ€™s a reasoned assessment:

### Business Administration
- Strengths such as empathy and appreciation for hard work can be beneficial in management roles.
- However, the sketch does not particularly align with typical traits associated with Business Administration (e.g., leadership, negotiation skills, interest in commerce).
- Interest in nature and animals is less directly applicable to Business Administration.

### Computer Science
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators for success in Computer Science.
- Enjoys solving puzzles, which is a significant aspect of computer programming and algorithm development.
- Traits such as empathy and love for animals are valuable but less relevant in choosing Computer Science as a field of study.

Given these qualitative assessments, Adam seems more aligned with fields requiring abstract thinking and problem-solving (like Computer Science) rather than commerce and leadership-oriented fields (like Business Administration).

Therefore, our approximate posterior conditional probabilities might look like this:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are illustrative and should be interpreted more as qualitative assessments rather than exact probabilities. The lower probability for Business Administration reflects that his personality traits don't strongly align with this field. The higher probability for Computer Science reflects the correlation between his analytical skills, intelligence, and love of puzzles with the typical demands of the field.
