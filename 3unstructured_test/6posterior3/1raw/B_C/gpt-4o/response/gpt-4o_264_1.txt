To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how Adam's personality traits and interests align with the typical requirements and characteristics of each field. This approach is informal and qualitative, leveraging intuition about each field's demands and the provided personality sketch.

### Key Traits from Adam's Personality Sketch:

1. **Curiosity about Nature and Plants** 
2. **Quiet and Puzzle-Solving Oriented**
3. **Warm Heart, Strong Empathy, and Love for Animals**
4. **High Intelligence and Understanding of Abstract Concepts**
5. **Understanding and Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication**

### Analysis:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - This field typically values leadership qualities, strong interpersonal skills, and a focus on business strategies and operations.
   - Adam's traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work align well, but his stronger affinity for nature, puzzles, and animals seems less aligned with typical business-focused curricula.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - This field often involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and working on various puzzles and algorithms—traits that closely match Adam's personality.
   - High intelligence and curiosity, especially in scientific realms, align well with the demands of computer science.
   - While empathy and a love for nature aren't core aspects, many with such traits still thrive in the field due to the analytical nature of the work.

Given these considerations, we can estimate the conditional probabilities qualitatively:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.2):** While some traits match, many of Adam’s core interests and characteristics don't strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student.
- **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam’s love for solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and his high intelligence make this a more likely match for his field of study.
