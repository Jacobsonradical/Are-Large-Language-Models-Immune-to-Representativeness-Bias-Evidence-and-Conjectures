To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics match with the typical profiles of students in those fields.

Let's evaluate the fit between Adam's personality and the fields in question:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Strong intelligence and abstract thinking are highly relevant.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles, which aligns well with problem-solving in computer science.
   - Curiosity about nature and empathy are less directly relevant but do not preclude interest in computer science.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Strong empathy and understanding of hard work are relevant for leadership and managerial roles.
   - High intelligence is applicable, but solving puzzles and love for animals are less indicative of business administration compared to computer science.

Given these considerations, let's assign subjective probabilities based on the match of these traits with typical profiles in each field. This is inherently a judgment call, as we lack precise base rates.

Let's estimate these probabilities as follows:
- Adam's interest in puzzles and higher abstract thinking aligns more strongly with computer science.
- His empathy and understanding of hard work somewhat align with business administration but less strongly.

Given this, I would assign:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```
These values are subjective estimates reflecting the relative fit of Adam's personality traits with the typical characteristics of students in each field. The total does not add up to 1, as there may be other relevant fields not considered here.
