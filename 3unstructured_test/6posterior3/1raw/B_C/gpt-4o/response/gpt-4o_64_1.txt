To calculate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider certain elements related to his interests, skills, and general demeanor and then apply them to our fields of interest.

Adam's personality sketch indicates:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles 
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Observations:
1. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are relevant in many fields including computer science.
2. Enjoyment in solving puzzles is often a key trait in computational thinking required for computer science.
3. A strong understanding of hard work and dedication can fit into any serious academic pursuit, including both computer science and business administration.
4. His curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals and empathy, might correlate more closely with fields related to biology, environmental science, and other life sciences, rather than computer science or business administration.

Given the provided personality traits and connecting them logically to the fields:

- **For Computer Science**: The enjoyment in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts strongly match with this field. Even though his love for nature and animals does not directly correlate, his high intelligence can still indicate a fit.

- **For Business Administration**: While appreciation for hard work and empathy can be beneficial in this field, the strong logical and analytical skillset highlighted fits less directly compared to Computer Science.

Taking these into account, we estimate and provide a probability closer to the effective likelihood of his enrollment:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These probabilities suggest that given Adam's described personality, he is more likely to be enrolled in computer science compared to business administration, while acknowledging that there are many other possible fields he could be enrolled in as well.
