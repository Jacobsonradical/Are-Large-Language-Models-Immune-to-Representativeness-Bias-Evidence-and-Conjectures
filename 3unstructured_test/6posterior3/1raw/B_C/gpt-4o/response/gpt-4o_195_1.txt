To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we'll rely on a combination of base rates (the general likelihood of students enrolling in these fields) and how well Adam's characteristics match typical profiles for these fields.

### Assumptions:
1. Base rates (prior probabilities) for graduate students pursuing Computer Science (CS) and Business Administration (MBA) might be different.
2. Likelihood of Adam's characteristics given his enrollment in each field.

### Personality Sketch and Field Match:
- **Curiosity about nature and plants**: This could align more with fields like biology or environmental science, and less directly with CS or MBA.
- **Enjoys solving puzzles**: More characteristic of CS.
- **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals**: More broadly applicable but might be less directly relevant to CS or MBA.
- **High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts**: Could apply to both CS and MBA but is particularly relevant for CS.
- **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Valuable in both fields but may not be a strong distinguishing feature.

### Conditional Probability Estimates:
Given these factors, let’s estimate conditional probabilities more intuitively:

- **Computer Science**: Given he enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with abstract concepts, there’s a strong incentive to think he fits well into CS. However, his empathy and love for animals are less descriptive for a typical CS profile.
- **Business Administration**: High intelligence and strong understanding of hard work apply here, but his deep love for nature and animals isn't directly relevant.

Thus, my estimates are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These reflect a stronger fit for Computer Science based on Adam's personality traits, especially his enjoyment of solving puzzles and ability to handle abstract concepts, with some, but less, relevance to Business Administration.
