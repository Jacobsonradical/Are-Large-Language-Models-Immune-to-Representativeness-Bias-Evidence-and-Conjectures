Explanation:
Adam's personality sketch indicates he has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart with strong empathy, and loves animals. These attributes suggest a person who is thoughtful, analytical, and compassionate. His high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts further indicate a propensity for fields that require deep thinking and complex problem-solving.

- **Business Administration**: This field typically involves management, finance, marketing, and dealing with people and organizations. While Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work would be beneficial in this field, his love for nature and solving puzzles does not strongly align with the core focus of a business discipline. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.

- **Computer Science**: This field involves a significant amount of problem-solving, logical thinking, and working with abstract concepts, which align well with Adam's characteristics. Additionally, the quiet and analytical nature he displays fits well with the type of work often done in computer science, which can include programming, algorithms, data analysis, and more. Thus, the conditional probability is considerably higher for computer science.
