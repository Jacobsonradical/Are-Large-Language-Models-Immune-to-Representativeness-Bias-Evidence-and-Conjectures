To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we'll use Bayesian reasoning. We need to consider the likelihood that Adam's personality traits would be observed given each field of study and weigh it against the base rate of students in those fields.

Unfortunately, without specific numerical data on the likelihood of these traits within each field and the base rates of students in business administration and computer science, we can only provide a qualitative assessment.

Based on the personality sketch provided:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Given these attributes, it seems more likely that Adam fits into a field related to science or technology rather than business administration. Subjects like computer science might appeal to his puzzle-solving skills and could align with his intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts. On the other hand, business administration focuses more on management, finance, and organizational behavior, which are not highlighted in his personality sketch.

Here are the qualitative posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are subjective estimates and would require actual data to refine precisely.
