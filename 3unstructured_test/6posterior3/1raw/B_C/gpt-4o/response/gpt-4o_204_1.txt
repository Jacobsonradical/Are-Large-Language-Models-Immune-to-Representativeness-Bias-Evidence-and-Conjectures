These probabilities are subjective assessments based on the given personality sketch. Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work suggest he might be more inclined towards fields involving analytical and abstract thinking or those aligned with his interests in nature and animals, like biology or environmental science. However, given the fields provided, computer science seems a better fit than business administration due to the problem-solving and abstract thinking components. 

Business administration typically involves leadership, social interaction, and a focus on markets and organizations, which does not seem to align closely with Adamâ€™s described personality traits. Therefore, the probability for business administration is given as relatively low.
