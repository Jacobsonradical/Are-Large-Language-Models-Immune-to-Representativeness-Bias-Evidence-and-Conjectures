To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider certain factors that align or do not align with these fields. 

Given Adam's characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
- Quiet demeanor and enjoyment of solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

We will use this information to informally assess how well these traits align with a student enrolled in either business administration or computer science.

### Business Administration
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: not typically aligned.
- Quiet demeanor and enjoyment of solving puzzles: not typically aligned.
- Warm heart, empathy, and love for animals: somewhat aligned (teamwork and leadership might benefit).
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: somewhat aligned (needed for business strategy).
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: highly aligned (important for business studies).

Considering these alignments, the probability is low but not zero.

### Computer Science
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: not directly aligned.
- Quiet demeanor and enjoyment of solving puzzles: highly aligned (common trait in computer science students).
- Warm heart, empathy, and love for animals: not typically associated but not detrimental.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: highly aligned (vital for computer science).
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: highly aligned (important in demanding computer science programs).

Given these considerations, let's provide the probabilities.

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

These values assume that Adam's traits as described are somewhat less aligned with business administration and more aligned with computer science.
