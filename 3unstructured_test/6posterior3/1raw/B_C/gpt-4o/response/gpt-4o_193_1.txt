To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we must consider the likelihood of his personality traits aligning with typical characteristics of students in these fields. 

We will use Bayes' theorem for this purpose. The formula for Bayes' theorem in this context is:

\[ P(Field | Traits) = \frac{P(Traits | Field) \cdot P(Field)}{P(Traits)} \]

Here’s a simplified qualitative analysis for the likelihood of Adam being in each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - **High Intelligence**: Likely, as computer science often requires strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
    - **Understanding Abstract Concepts**: Very likely, as computer science involves a lot of abstract thinking, particularly in areas like algorithms, data structures, and theoretical computer science.
    - **Enjoys Solving Puzzles**: Aligns well with computer science, as programming and algorithm design are akin to solving puzzles.
    - **Curiosity about Nature/Plants** and **Empathy/Love for Animals**: These traits don’t necessarily align strongly with computer science but do not preclude it either.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - **High Intelligence**: Likely, as business administration requires strategic thinking and understanding of complex systems.
    - **Understanding Abstract Concepts**: Could be applicable, especially in high-level strategic planning and economics.
    - **Warm Heart, Strong Empathy**: These traits are beneficial for fields like business administration, particularly in management, human resources, and organizational behavior.
    - **Curiosity about Nature/Plants** and **Empathy/Love for Animals**: These traits might not typically align with business administration, though they could be relevant in fields like corporate sustainability or social entrepreneurship.

Given this qualitative analysis, we postulate the following conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.65",
  "business administration": "0.35"
}
```

These values reflect the likelihood that Adam's attributes align with typical characteristics in each field. While high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and abstract thinking strongly favor computer science, his empathy and appreciation for hard work also make a compelling case for business administration, particularly in roles that require strong interpersonal skills.
