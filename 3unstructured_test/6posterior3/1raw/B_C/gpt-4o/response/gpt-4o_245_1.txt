To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider Adam's characteristics and how they align with typical students in each field. This process is subjective but can be approached by evaluating how well the personality traits map to the field's common attributes.

- **Computer Science**: This field generally attracts individuals who have a high level of intelligence, enjoy solving puzzles, and have a strong understanding of abstract concepts. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, his intelligence, and his enjoyment of puzzles, these traits are strong indicators for computer science.

- **Business Administration**: This field might attract individuals with strong communication skills, leadership abilities, and a focus on organizational dynamics and economics. While Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work are relevant, his other traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, enjoyment of solving puzzles) are less directly aligned with the typical attributes of business administration students.

Given this reasoning, we can make an educated guess about the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are subjective estimates based on the personality traits described and how they align with the common characteristics of students in those fields.
