To compute the posterior probabilities, we need to consider the likelihood that Adam's personality traits fit each field of study. Bayesian inference can be used to update these probabilities, but since we do not have prior probabilities for his enrollment in each field, the quantitative approach may be more subjective.

Given Adam's personality traits:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoyment of solving puzzles (indicative of strong logical abilities).
3. Warm heart and strong empathy.
4. Deep love for animals.
5. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
6. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits suggest that Adam might be more inclined towards fields that involve a deep understanding of the natural world, logical problem-solving, and practical applications that impact living beings.

### Computer Science:
- Curiosity about nature and solving puzzles suggest a strong analytical mindset, which is highly compatible with computer science.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts also align well with the field of computer science.
- However, computer science may not align as directly with his love for animals and empathy unless he is working on applications such as computational biology or AI-driven conservation efforts.

### Business Administration:
- Strong empathy and warm heart could be considered beneficial for roles in management and human resources.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is fundamental to success in business.
- However, traits such as deep curiosity about nature, love for animals, and inclination for problem-solving puzzles are less indicative of a traditional business administration path unless his business focus involves environmental management or social enterprises.

Combining these qualitative insights, we can estimate the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.35
}
```

These values reflect that while both fields could align with some of Adam's traits, computer science seems slightly more internally consistent with his analytical and problem-solving disposition. Business administration is less aligned with his interest in nature and animals but aligns with his empathy and appreciation for hard work.
