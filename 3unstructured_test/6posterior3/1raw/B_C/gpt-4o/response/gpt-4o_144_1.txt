To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. However, we need to make certain assumptions as we do not have exact prior probabilities or likelihoods. Hence, we can rely on reasonable assumptions based on the given personality traits and how they typically match with students in these fields.

Given Adam's personality sketch, the traits such as high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals align more closely with fields that involve analytical thinking and a passion for understanding natural or abstract phenomena.

Now let's assess these probabilities qualitatively:

- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence, penchant for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts could align with this field. However, there's no specific mention of an interest in technology or computers.
  
- **Business Administration**: The traits listed (empathy, understanding and appreciation for hard work, etc.) may benefit someone in business administration for leadership positions, but they donâ€™t strongly suggest an interest in business management or corporate environments.

Given this rough qualitative analysis and the likelihood of these traits appearing in the general profiles of students in these fields, we might express the probabilities as such:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Note: These values are estimated based on qualitative assessment and the given description. In a real-world scenario, more detailed demographic data and statistical analysis would be needed for accurate calculation.
