To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider the likelihood of each personality trait aligning with typical students in each field. 

Given the data:
- Adam has genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is highly intelligent and understands abstract concepts well.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Let's analyze how these characteristics line up with each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: High relevance (common in computer science).
   - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts: High relevance.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant to any rigorous field.
   - Curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, love for animals: Less directly relevant but doesn't rule it out.

Given these considerations, we perceive a decent match but with some non-overlapping traits (like curiosity about nature).

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant.
   - Strong understanding and appreciation: Common but not specific to business administration.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy: Possibly relevant, especially for leadership roles, but not definitive.

Overall, his traits don't align as strongly with the stereotype of a business administration student compared to a computer science student.

Given these analyses, we could approximate the likelihoods as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values suggest that while there is a notable chance Adam is studying computer science given his traits, there is a lower, albeit non-negligible, chance he is studying business administration. The sum does not total to 1, reflecting that there might be other fields more aligned with his full personality profile.
