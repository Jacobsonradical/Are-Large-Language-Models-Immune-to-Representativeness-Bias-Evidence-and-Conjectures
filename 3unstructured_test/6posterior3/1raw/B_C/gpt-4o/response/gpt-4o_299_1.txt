To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, in this simplified scenario, we won't compute precise numeric values due to the lack of specific prior probabilities and likelihoods.

Instead, we'll qualitatively assess how well Adam's personality aligns with typical profiles in these fields and estimate the probabilities.

Let's summarize how Adam's traits align with both fields:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants**: Not directly related, but curiosity is a good trait for a scientist.
   - **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Highly relevant, as computer science involves problem-solving and computational thinking.
   - **High intelligence and abstract thinking**: Crucial for understanding complex algorithms and theories.
   - **Warm heart, empathy, love for animals**: While not directly related, these traits do not detract from suitability.
   
2. **Business Administration:**
   - **Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants**: Not directly relevant.
   - **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Somewhat relevant, as strategic thinking and problem-solving are important.
   - **High intelligence and abstract thinking**: Important for business strategy and administration.
   - **Warm heart, empathy**: Relevant for leadership and management roles.
   - **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Highly relevant for business, which often requires perseverance.

Taking these qualitative assessments into account, it's likely that Adam's traits make him more suited for computer science over business administration, particularly due to his enjoyment of puzzles and abstract thinking.

Here is an estimated probability:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

These values are qualitative and indicative, reflecting that Adam's traits align more closely with those typically seen in computer science students than in business administration students. For precise calculations, specific prior probabilities and other detailed information would be needed.
