To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being in a specific field (business administration or computer science) given his personality traits (B).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in a specific field.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being in a specific field.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits overall.

For simplicity's sake, we don't have exact numerical values for \( P(B|A) \), \( P(A) \), and \( P(B) \), but we can make qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality sketch:

Given:
- Adam is genuinely curious about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Now let's assess the likelihoods qualitatively:

1. Business Administration:
   - Generally, business administration students might be more focused on organizational management, finance, and strategic planning.
   - Empathy and appreciation for hard work can be relevant, but a love for nature, plants, animals, curiosity about nature, and solving puzzles are less directly related.
   - This suggests a relatively low likelihood. However, aspects like abstract thinking and intelligence could still contribute.

2. Computer Science:
   - Computer science often involves problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and working on logical puzzles, which aligns well with Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and intelligence.
   - A quiet demeanor is often associated with a preference for solitary work, which can be common in computer science.
   - Although love for nature and animals might not be directly relevant, it doesn't negate the fit for the field.
   - This suggests a relatively higher likelihood compared to business administration.

Based on this qualitative assessment, the posterior conditional probabilities might look like this:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Please note these values are estimated based on qualitative judgments and not precise calculations. The exact posterior probabilities would require precise numerical data for prior probabilities and likelihoods.
