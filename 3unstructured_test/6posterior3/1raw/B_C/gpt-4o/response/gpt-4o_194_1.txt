To compute the posterior probabilities, we need to use Bayes' theorem. However, without specific base rates, exact likelihoods, and prior distributions, we're unable to provide precise numerical probabilities. Instead, we can qualitatively assess his fit for each field based on his personality traits.

Given Adam's traits:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.**
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.**
3. **Warm-hearted, empathetic, and loves animals.**
4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.**
5. **Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.**

Considering these points:

1. **Computer Science**: This field values high intelligence, strong problem-solving skills, and the ability to understand abstract concepts. While curiosity about nature isn't directly relevant, the skills of solving puzzles and abstract thinking align well with computer science. Empathy and love for animals, though not directly linked, don't conflict with the requirements of this field.

2. **Business Administration**: This field often values networking, leadership, and strong verbal and interpersonal skills. While Adam is warm-hearted and empathetic, his quiet nature and deep intellectual curiosity lean more towards fields requiring solitary or highly focused work, rather than the social and communicative aspects prominent in business administration.

Based on these qualitative assessments, it seems that computer science aligns better with Adam's personality and skills. Therefore, we might say there's a higher posterior conditional probability for computer science over business administration for Adamâ€™s graduate field.

Using the requested format:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

These values are illustrative and based on a qualitative analysis rather than actual computational probability.
