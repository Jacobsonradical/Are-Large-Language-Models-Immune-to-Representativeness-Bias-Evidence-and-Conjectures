To compute the posterior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in computer science or business administration based on his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics fit each field.

Generally, students in computer science (CS) often possess strong problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and an ability to understand abstract concepts, which aligns well with Adam's traits, such as enjoying solving puzzles and having high intelligence. However, specific interests in nature and animals are less indicative of a CS student.

On the other hand, business administration students often demonstrate strong interpersonal skills, a good understanding of human behavior, and practical business-oriented thinking. Adam's warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work, while valuable, do not directly suggest a strong fit for business administration, especially given his specific interest in nature and solving abstract problems.

Given this analysis, we can assign higher probability to computer science, though not overwhelmingly so, as his qualities don't exclusively rule out another field.

Prior probabilistic values might be speculative, but typically, computer science fits better. Note that other factors and fields might affect these probabilities in a real-world setting. Here's a reasonable estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
