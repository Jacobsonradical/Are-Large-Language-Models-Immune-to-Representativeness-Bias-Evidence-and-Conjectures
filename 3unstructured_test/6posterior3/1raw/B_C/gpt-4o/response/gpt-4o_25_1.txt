Explanation: 

Given Adam’s personality sketch, he exhibits qualities such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, empathy, and an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts. These characteristics are more closely associated with fields that involve critical thinking, problem-solving, and a scientific or research orientation rather than business-related tasks.

Business Administration: This field typically involves management, leadership, human resources, finance, and operational skills. Adam's warm heart and strong empathy might be beneficial in business settings focused on teamwork and management, but his deep interest in nature, plants, and animals indicates that his interests might lie elsewhere. Thus, the probability of him being in Business Administration is lower.

Computer Science: This field involves abstract concepts, problem-solving, and often research on topics that could intersect with Adam’s interests in nature and puzzles. The probability of Adam being in Computer Science is higher because his intelligence, curiosity, and problem-solving abilities fit well with the rigors and interests typical in computer science fields.

By considering these aspects, I assigned the aforementioned probabilities.
