To compute the posterior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in Business Administration or Computer Science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayesian reasoning. However, strictly speaking, without specific prior probabilities or a detailed statistical model, we can only make an educated guess based on the matches between his personality traits and the typical traits aligned with these fields.

Given Adam's personality sketch:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let’s consider how well these traits align with the typical characteristics and requirements of the given fields:

### Business Administration

- Typical Traits: Leadership, management skills, strategic thinking, communication skills, networking, financial insight.
- Overlap with Adam: While Adam’s appreciation for hard work and high intelligence could be beneficial, his quiet nature, empathy, and curiosity about nature do not strongly align with typical business administration traits.

### Computer Science

- Typical Traits: Problem-solving skills, logical and abstract thinking, persistence, detail-oriented, often enjoy working independently or in small groups.
- Overlap with Adam: Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence and strong abstract thinking abilities. His quiet nature also aligns well with a field that sometimes involves less direct human interaction.

Based on these alignments, the posterior probability for each field might look something like this:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,  // Given the weak alignment with typical traits
  "computer science": 0.7  // Given the strong alignment with problem-solving and abstract thinking skills
}
```

Please note that this estimation is a qualitative analysis based on the match of personality traits to typical field characteristics. For precise probabilities, more detailed data and statistical analysis would be required.
