To compute the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either Business Administration or Computer Science given the personality sketch, we must consider the congruence of his traits with the typical requirements and nature of each field. However, in the absence of specific base rate data and probabilistic models, our calculation will be more qualitative. 

Let's analyze the given information in the context of each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Traits: While empathy, appreciation for hard work, and high intelligence can be beneficial in business, Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of puzzles do not strongly align with business administration. Business studies often emphasize interpersonal skills, market analysis, leadership, and strategic planning which may not be as aligned with his interests.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Traits: Strong intelligence, enjoyment in solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work align well with the typical profile of a computer science student. Additionally, his quiet nature and intrinsic motivation would complement the often solitary and logical work in this field. 
   
So based on these considerations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

While these probabilities are qualitative and somewhat subjective, they reflect a better fit of Adam's personality traits with a graduate program in Computer Science compared to Business Administration. The remaining probability acknowledges that Adam could be well-suited for other fields not considered in this analysis.
