To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to use Bayes' theorem. However, this requires prior probabilities and likelihoods of Adam's personality sketch given each field, which are not provided. Instead, we will make educated guesses based on the given personality traits.

Given Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits suggest that fields related to nature, abstract thinking, and possibly altruism might be more aligned with Adam's characteristics. Computer science involves a lot of abstract thinking and puzzle-solving, which aligns with Adam's skills and interests. Business administration, while requiring intelligence and appreciation for hard work, might not align as closely with his other traits like a deep love for animals and nature.

Based on this qualitative analysis, we'll estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values are educated guesses based on the alignment of Adam's personality with the traits typically favored in each field.
