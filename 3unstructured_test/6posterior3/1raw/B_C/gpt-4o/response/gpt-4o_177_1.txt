Determining posterior probabilities based on the given personality sketch requires combining prior knowledge about the likelihood of students with particular traits enrolling in each field and the traits described in Adam's sketch.

Given Adam's interests and traits, we can think about how they match with common stereotypes and profiles in business administration and computer science:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Characteristics: Business administration students often have strong skills in management, economics, finance, and may be more extraverted and people-oriented.
   - Matching with Adam's Traits: Adam's profile does not prominently display interests or traits typically aligned with business administration, such as an interest in finances, management, or a more extroverted personality.
  
2. **Computer Science:**
   - Characteristics: Computer science students often have strong logical and problem-solving skills, a fascination with technology, and an interest in abstract concepts.
   - Matching with Adam's Traits: Adam exhibits high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and has a good understanding of abstract concepts. These are traits highly desirable in computer science.

Using these crude evaluations, we can then estimate the posterior conditional probabilities.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.75
}
```

These probabilities reflect the qualitative alignment: Adam is less likely to be in a program like business administration and far more likely to be in computer science, given his described personality traits. The values are informed estimates based on the fit between his characteristics and the typical profiles in these fields.
