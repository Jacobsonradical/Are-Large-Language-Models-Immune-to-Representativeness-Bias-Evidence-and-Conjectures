To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we’ll need to rely partly on assumptions and heuristic reasoning since we don't have precise prior probabilities or detailed statistical data. 

Here’s how we might informally proceed:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Typical traits for business administration students might include interest in leadership, economics, finance, and networking.
   - Adam's traits such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and strong appreciation for hard work don't naturally align closely with business administration, which typically focuses more on human systems, management, and markets.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Computer Science students often exhibit traits of high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts.
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and demonstrates high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, all of which align well with traits common in computer science.

Using these heuristic considerations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values assume:
- **For Business Administration**: A lower probability because Adam’s personal interests and personality do not strongly align with typical business administration traits.
- **For Computer Science**: A higher probability because of Adam’s problem-solving abilities, intelligence, and love for abstract concepts, which are well-aligned with characteristics key to computer science.
