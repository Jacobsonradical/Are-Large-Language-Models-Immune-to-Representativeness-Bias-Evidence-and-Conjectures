To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either "computer science" or "business administration" given his personality traits, we must use Bayesian reasoning. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can only make qualitative assessments based on his personality sketch and traits associated with those fields.

Given his interests and qualities:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
2. Enjoys solving puzzles
3. Warm-hearted and empathetic
4. Deep love for animals
5. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
6. Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

We need to assess which field aligns more closely with his traits:

- **Computer Science:** This field highly values problem-solving skills, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. Adam's quiet and introspective nature and his enjoyment of puzzles also fit well with computer science.

- **Business Administration:** This field often values social interaction, leadership, and strategic thinking. While empathy and appreciation for hard work are positive traits here, Adam's quiet nature, strong empathy, and love for animals are less directly applicable.

Using this qualitive analysis, Adam's traits align more closely with those valued in computer science than in business administration.

Thus, the qualitative posterior probabilities could be estimated as:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
