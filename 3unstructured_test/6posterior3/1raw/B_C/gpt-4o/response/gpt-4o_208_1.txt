To compute the posterior conditional probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics align with typical traits for each field of interest. 

Given:

1. **Business Administration**: This field often requires a blend of leadership, strategic thinking, ability to work in teams, and strong communication skills. Analytical abilities and an understanding of economics and management principles are also crucial.

2. **Computer Science**: This field typically requires a strong aptitude for problem-solving, abstract thinking, and technical skills. Cognitive and mathematical abilities are often paramount. Additionally, attributes like curiosity, particularly if it leans towards programming, AI, algorithms, and software development, are important.

Now, let's align Adam's traits with the requirements of each field:

- **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**: This is relatively neutral for both fields.
- **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Highly relevant for computer science.
- **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals**: Not especially relevant for either field but less relevant for a field like computer science which often doesn't focus on empathy in the professional sense.
- **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: Relevant for both fields, but especially crucial for computer science.
- **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This trait is valuable in any field.

Considering these alignments:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Reasoning:
- Adam's propensity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts weights heavily towards computer science.
- His intelligence is a key asset in both fields but is slightly more critical for the technical demands of computer science.
- The traits that might align with business administration, such as communication and leadership, are not specifically identified in the sketch, leading to a lower conditional probability for business administration compared to computer science.

Therefore, the probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science is significantly higher than in business administration based on his described personality traits.
