{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning behind these values:

1. **Business Administration (0.1)**: Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with typical attributes associated with business administration students. While he has a high intelligence and understanding of hard work, which are valuable in any field, his deep love for nature, animals, and empathy does not strongly suggest a business-oriented focus.

2. **Computer Science (0.3)**: Adam's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are all characteristics that are often associated with computer science students. Although his love for nature and animals doesn't specifically point toward computer science, the other attributes are strong indicators for this field. However, his other interests might suggest a likelihood for another scientific field related to nature or life sciences. 

Note: These are subjective estimations based on the personality sketch provided. Bayesian reasoning in a real scenario would involve more specific prior knowledge about the distribution of students in various fields given their personality traits.
