To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either Business Administration or Computer Science given his personality sketch, we would typically apply Bayes' theorem. However, in the absence of specific numerical prior probabilities or likelihoods for Adam's enrollment in these fields based on his personality sketch, I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the described characteristics.

Given Adam’s characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

Adam’s personality sketch aligns more closely with fields that involve problem-solving, abstract thinking, empathy, and an interest in nature. Therefore, Computer Science seems somewhat plausible due to his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts, whereas Business Administration might appear less likely given his strong empathy and love for animals.

That said, without concrete numerical data, these are qualitative estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These estimates suggest that, based on his personality sketch alone, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science than in Business Administration. However, these probabilities are not definitive and would ideally be refined by more specific data on priors and likelihoods.
