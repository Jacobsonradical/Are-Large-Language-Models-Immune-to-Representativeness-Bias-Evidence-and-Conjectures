To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we'd ideally use Bayes' Theorem. However, due to the lack of specific base-rate information about enrollment proportions and personality traits' correlation with fields of study, we will rely on a qualitative assessment based on the given characteristics.

Adam's profile suggests a natural inclination towards fields that involve abstract thinking, analytical problem-solving, and possibly a connection to nature or an appreciation for dedication and hard work. Using this qualitative analysis, I'll provide the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Computer Science:** Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators for a fit in computer science. The analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science aligns well with his described personality.

- **Business Administration:** While his appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit into business administration, the personality traits such as empathy and a deep love for animals are less directly relevant to this field compared to computer science. 

Thus, based on the given personality sketch, there is a higher likelihood for Adam to be in computer science than in business administration.
