To determine the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration, we need to consider how well his personality sketch aligns with the typical attributes and interests associated with each field. 

Here’s a brief analysis of the alignment:

- **Computer Science**: Interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with this field. Empathy and a love for animals are less directly relevant but do not exclude him from this field.
- **Business Administration**: Strong empathy, a warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication can be useful in business, particularly in areas like human resources or leadership roles. However, the curiosity about nature and solving puzzles are less commonly associated with business administration.

Based on these considerations, we can make an educated estimate of the probabilities. The numbers are subjective estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect that Adam’s interests and personality traits are more strongly aligned with computer science than with business administration based on the provided sketch.
