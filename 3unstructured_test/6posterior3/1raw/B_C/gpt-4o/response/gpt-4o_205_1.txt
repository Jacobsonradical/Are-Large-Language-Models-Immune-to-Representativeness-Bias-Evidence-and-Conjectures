To solve this problem, we use Bayesian reasoning to estimate the posterior conditional probabilities. We start by defining the traits given in Adam's personality sketch and assess their relevance to each field.

Key traits to consider:
1. Curiosity about nature and plants
2. Enjoyment in solving puzzles
3. Warm-hearted and strong empathy
4. Love for animals
5. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
6. Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

Relevance to Computer Science:
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles and high intelligence with understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators.
- Curiosity and appreciation for hard work are generally relevant but not specifically to nature/plants.
- Empathy and love for animals are less directly relevant.

Relevance to Business Administration:
- Empathy and warm-heartedness could be quite relevant for managing teams and understanding consumer behavior.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work are important traits.
- Curiosity about nature and love for animals are less directly relevant.

Based on these assessments, we could assign rough subjective probabilities. While this is speculative, it provides a reasonable basis for estimation.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These probabilities reflect the higher relevance of the technical and problem-solving aspects of Adam's personality to Computer Science, compared to a moderate relevance to Business Administration.
