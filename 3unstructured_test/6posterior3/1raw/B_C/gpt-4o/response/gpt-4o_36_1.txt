To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities of Adam being enrolled in computer science or business administration, we can consider the alignment between his personality traits and the typical characteristics and motivations of students in these fields.

**Computer Science:**
- High intelligence: Relevant for the technical and analytical nature of computer science.
- Good at understanding abstract concepts: Very relevant for algorithmic thinking in computer science.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Frequently associated with coding and problem-solving in computer science.

**Business Administration:**
- Warm heart and strong empathy: Useful for management, leadership, and team coordination.
- Deep love for animals and nature: Not directly relevant, but an appreciation for hard work and dedication can be seen in the context of business studies.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Useful but perhaps less central than in computer science.

Considering the information:

1. **Computer Science** seems highly compatible with Adam's intellectual traits and his liking for puzzles and abstract concepts.
2. **Business Administration**, while aligning with his empathy and appreciation for dedication and hard work, appears slightly less fitting overall in comparison to computer science.

Given these points, here are the posterior conditional probabilities in the required format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

These values are subjective estimations based on the given traits and typical requirements or affinities of the fields. They reflect the idea that Adam's profile aligns more closely with computer science than business administration, but both are plausible fields of study for him.
