To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we need to consider how his traits align with the typical characteristics and interests associated with those fields. This can be approached using Bayesian inference, balancing prior probabilities (base rates) of enrollment in each field with the likelihood of the observed traits given those fields.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence: High relevance.
   - Good at understanding abstract concepts: High relevance.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: High relevance.

   Adam’s traits align quite well with characteristics often found in computer science students, who typically need strong abstract thinking and problem-solving skills.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - High intelligence: Relevant.
   - Strong empathy: Relevant.
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work: Relevant.

   While some of Adam's traits fit business administration (e.g., high intelligence, empathy, appreciation for hard work), they are generally less specific indicators compared to computer science.

Using a heuristic instead of an exact mathematical formulation (since priors and detailed likelihoods are not specified), we might assign the following probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

Given Adam’s personality and interests, it seems significantly more probable that he was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration based on his affinity for puzzles and abstract thinking, along with his intelligence and curiosity about nature.
