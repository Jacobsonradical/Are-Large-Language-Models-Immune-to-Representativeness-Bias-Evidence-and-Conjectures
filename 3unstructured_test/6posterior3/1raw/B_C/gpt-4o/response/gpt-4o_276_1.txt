To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science, we need to consider how well his personality traits align with the typical characteristics and interests of students in each field. Though we don't have precise probabilistic models at hand, we can use heuristic reasoning to give a reasonable estimate.

Given his characteristics:
- **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**
- **Enjoys solving puzzles**
- **Warm heart, strong empathy**
- **Deep love for animals**
- **High intelligence**
- **Understanding of abstract concepts**
- **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**

We can analyze the fit to each field:

### Business Administration
- A curiosity about nature and plants and a love for animals are not particularly associated with business administration.
- Empathy and a warm heart can be advantageous in management and human resources.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work are good fits for the rigorous demands of a business curriculum.
- However, enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are less directly aligned with business fields, which often focus more on practical and interpersonal skills.

### Computer Science
- Enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are highly aligned with computer science.
- High intelligence suits the analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science.
- While empathy and a warm heart are beneficial in any field, they are less critical in computer science compared to business administration.
- Curiosity about nature and animals might not be directly relevant but doesn't contraindicate computer science.

Based on this reasoning, it's more likely for Adam to be in computer science than business administration. Therefore, we can roughly estimate the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect a stronger alignment of Adam's personality traits with computer science over business administration, acknowledging that there are many other possible fields he could be enrolled in.
