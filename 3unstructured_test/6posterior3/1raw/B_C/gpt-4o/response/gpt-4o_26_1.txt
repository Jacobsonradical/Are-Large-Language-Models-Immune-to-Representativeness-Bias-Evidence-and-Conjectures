To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we ought to consider the alignment of his attributes with the typical characteristics expected in each field. Below, I will provide an intuitive estimate:

1. **Business Administration**: Usually, business administration students may have a strong interest in organizational processes, leadership, and strategic decision-making. While these skills can align with high intelligence and an appreciation for hard work, Adam's strong empathy, quiet nature, curiosity about nature, and love for animals seem less directly connected to the typical interests associated with business administration. Therefore, the probability that he was enrolled in business administration is comparatively lower.

2. **Computer Science**: Students in computer science often exhibit high intelligence, enjoy solving puzzles, and have an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts. Adam’s attributes of liking puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence align well with this field. His empathy and love for animals might suggest an interest in areas like bioinformatics or environmental applications of computer science, although they are less directly indicative of the field overall.

Given these considerations, here are the conditional probabilities, albeit rough estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These estimates reflect a higher alignment of Adam’s traits with the field of computer science compared to business administration.
