To estimate the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science, I'll use some reasonable assumptions based on his personality traits, rather than precise prior probabilities and likelihoods, which are unavailable. 

1. **Business Administration**: This field typically attracts people who are more strongly motivated by leadership, management, and often financial success. It may not align perfectly with Adam’s deep love for nature, animals, and puzzles.
2. **Computer Science**: This field requires high intelligence, abstract thinking, and a penchant for puzzles, which fits Adam’s characteristics very well. Adam's curiosity about nature could also involve computational biology or environmental modeling, making this a more likely field for him based on his personality.

Given these assumptions, let's assign probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These probabilities reflect the likelihood of Adam’s enrollment in each field based on the given personality sketch, showing a higher probability for computer science due to his interests and traits aligning more closely with this specialization.
