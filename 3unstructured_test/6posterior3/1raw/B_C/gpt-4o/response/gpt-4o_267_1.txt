To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, Bayesian reasoning can be useful. However, we need to make some assumptions about the base rates (priors) of students in these fields and how well Adam's traits fit into each field. 

Assuming these priors and likelihoods based on typical personality traits associated with these fields:

1. **Business Administration**:
    - Prior assumption: Business administration programs might generally attract people who are outgoing, strategic, and often less focused on nature and animals. High base rate because business programs are common.
    - Likelihood of personality traits given field:
        - Genuine curiosity about nature: Low
        - Quiet and enjoys puzzles: Medium
        - Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: Low to Medium
        - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Medium 
        - Appreciation for hard work: Medium 
      
2. **Computer Science**:
    - Prior assumption: Computer science programs often attract individuals who are analytical, enjoy puzzles, and have strong logical reasoning skills. Moderate base rate.
    - Likelihood of personality traits given field:
        - Genuine curiosity about nature: Medium 
        - Quiet and enjoys puzzles: High
        - Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: Medium
        - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: High
        - Appreciation for hard work: Medium to High

Based on these assumptions, we have:

- Base rate of business administration students among grad students: 0.3 (for example)
- Base rate of computer science students among grad students: 0.2 (for example)
- Likelihood of Adam's traits for business administration: let's say 0.1
- Likelihood of Adam's traits for computer science: let's say 0.4 

Using Bayesâ€™ Theorem: 

\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the likelihood of Adam's traits given that field.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability of being in that field.
- \( P(A) \) is the normalization factor, which can be ignored here since we don't require the values to add up to 1.

Thus, using simplifying assumptions without calculating \( P(A) \),

We get:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|A) \propto P(A|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|A) \propto P(A|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Converting these into comparable probabilities:

\[ \text{normalize: } 0.08 + 0.03 = 0.11 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|A) = \frac{0.03}{0.11} \approx 0.273 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|A) = \frac{0.08}{0.11} \approx 0.727 \]

So,

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.273,
  "computer science": 0.727
}
```
