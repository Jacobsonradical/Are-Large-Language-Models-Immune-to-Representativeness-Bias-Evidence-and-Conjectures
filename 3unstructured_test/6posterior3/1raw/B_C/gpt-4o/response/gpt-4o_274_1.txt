To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either Business Administration or Computer Science given his personality sketch, we need to consider the likelihood that his traits are associated with each field. 

**Posterior probability estimation approach (informal):**
1. **Curiosity about nature and plants:** More relevant to science and less to business.
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles:** Traits more aligned with fields that require problem-solving and analytical thinking, such as computer science.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals:** Could lean towards compassionate fields, possibly less directly related to business.
4. **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts:** Can fit both fields but has a strong fit with technical fields like computer science.
5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** Valued in both fields but crucial in rigorous technical fields like computer science.

Given these considerations, it is more likely that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science than in Business Administration based on the provided sketch. While both disciplines appreciate intelligence and dedication, the specific interest in nature, problem-solving, and empathy slightly tilts the scales in favor of Computer Science.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

This informal estimation suggests that Adam's personality traits and interests are more likely to align with a field like Computer Science than Business Administration, but there's a small probability he could still be enrolled in Business Administration.
