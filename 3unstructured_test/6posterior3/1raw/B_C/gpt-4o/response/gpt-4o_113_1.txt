Given Adam's personality sketch, we can consider how his traits align with common characteristics and requirements of graduate students in the fields of computer science and business administration. Here are some relevant observations:

1. Curiosity about nature and various plants, strong empathy, and love for animals suggest an inclination towards environmental sciences or biology, which might slightly detract from both computer science and business administration.
2. Enjoying solving puzzles and high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science.
3. Warm heart and strong empathy are less typical for computer science, which is often seen as a more analytical and less socially-focused field.
4. Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in both fields, though these traits are generally applicable to any graduate program.

Combining this analysis, let's compute the posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These probabilities are educated estimations based on the personality traits highlighted in Adam's sketch.
