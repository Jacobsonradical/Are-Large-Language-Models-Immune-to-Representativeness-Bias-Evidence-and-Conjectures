To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we can use Bayesian reasoning. However, precise numerical values would typically require prior probabilities and detailed statistical data that we do not have at our disposal. Instead, we can make qualitative assessments based on Adam’s personality sketch.

Let's analyze each field:

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and his enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with qualities often seen in computer science students. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit this profile. 
   
   However, there is no specific mention of a keen interest in technology or computers, which might slightly lower the probability.
   
2. **Business Administration**: 
   - While Adam’s empathy and appreciation for hard work are valuable traits in business administration, the personality sketch emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which are not central to business administration. His interest seems more aligned with scientific inquiry rather than business leadership or management.

Based on the above analysis, we can make a relative estimation of the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are based on a qualitative analysis of Adam's personality sketch and the typical attributes of students in these fields. The numbers reflect that Adam’s characteristics are more aligned with computer science than with business administration but still consider the absence of explicit interests in technology for the former.
