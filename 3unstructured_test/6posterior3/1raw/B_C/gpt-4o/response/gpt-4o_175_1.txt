To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which in its general form is given as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \(A\) is the event that Adam is enrolled in a specific field of study (e.g., Computer Science or Business Administration).
- \(B\) is the set of observations about Adam's personality.

Since we don't have specific numerical values for the probabilities (like the base rates \(P(A)\)), we'll have to make some reasonable assumptions based on his personality traits.

**Assumptions and Reasoning**:
1. Adam shows a genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and a love for animals, which might be less typical for someone enrolled in Business Administration and more typical for someone in fields related to science or environmental studies.
2. Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which is essential for Computer Science but might also be relevant for Business Administration.
3. Business Administration might require strong interpersonal skills and a keen interest in organizational behavior and strategy, which doesn't seem strongly highlighted in the sketch.
4. The observation about an appreciation for hard work and dedication is neutral but pertinent to both fields.

**Posterior Probabilities (Normalized Estimates)**:

Given the sketch, Adam's traits seem to align more closely with what might be expected from a Computer Science graduate, though his empathy and love for animals could mean he is potentially less likely in Business Administration. Without exact base rates and detailed conditional probabilities, we'll provide a qualitative estimate based on the given traits.

**Estimation:**

- **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators. Even though his empathy and love for animals aren't direct indicators, they don't contradict a focus in computer science.

- **Business Administration**: Adam's traits don't strongly align with typical Business Administration characteristics, except for a broad appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Thus, we make an educated guess:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect a higher probability for Computer Science given the sketch but acknowledge a non-negligible chance he could still be in Business Administration due to his appreciation of hard work and intelligence.
