To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities, we must apply Bayes' theorem. However, for an accurate calculation, we need prior probabilities (the actual general distribution of graduate students across different fields) and likelihoods (the probability that a person with Adam's personality traits would be enrolled in those fields). Without specific prior and likelihood values, we will resort to a qualitative assessment based on Adam's personality sketch.

Here is the reasoning before the computation:

1. **Business Administration**: Typically, students in business administration are perceived to have strong interpersonal skills, a penchant for leadership, strategic thinking, and often a more extroverted nature. Adam's traits—curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work—don't strongly align with the stereotypical traits for business administration, although it's possible. The quiet nature and puzzle-solving inclination are less relevant to the typical perception of this field.

2. **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals who are adept at solving puzzles, have high intelligence, and are comfortable with abstract thinking. Adam's quiet nature, intelligence, puzzle-solving enjoyment, and empathy align well with traits common in computer science students. The appreciation of hard work and dedication is also important in this rigorous field.

Given the qualitative analysis above, let's provide the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values are qualitative approximations based on the personality sketch, reflecting a higher likelihood of Adam being in computer science compared to business administration.
