To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science, we need to use Bayes' theorem. However, without knowing the exact prior probabilities of students in each field, we will make reasonable qualitative inferences based on Adam's personality sketch and general characteristics of the fields in question.

Let's evaluate Adam's fit for each field based on his personality sketch:

1. **Business Administration**: 
    - Business administration often involves managing teams, making strategic decisions, and economic planning. It tends to attract individuals who are more extroverted, business-savvy, and interested in organizational leadership.
    - Adam's personality traits, such as his quiet nature, genuine curiosity about nature, and strong empathy, are not a strong match for the typical characteristics of those in business administration.

2. **Computer Science**:
    - Computer science often involves a lot of problem-solving, abstraction, dealing with abstract concepts, and can align well with interests in puzzles and high intelligence.
    - Adamâ€™s quiet nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts make him a better fit for computer science.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can infer that Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in computer science than in business administration.

Given these considerations, here are the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are qualitative estimates, representing the relative likelihood based on the provided personality sketch. Actual probabilities would depend on more detailed empirical data and priors.
