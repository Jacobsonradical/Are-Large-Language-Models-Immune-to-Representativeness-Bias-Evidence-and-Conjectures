To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we will use Bayesian reasoning. However, without concrete base rates (prior probabilities) of students enrolled in these fields and data on how common Adam's personality traits are in these fields (likelihoods), we must make educated guesses based on the description.

Let's break down how these traits could be relevant to each field:

### Personality Sketch Traits:
1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**: This could be more relevant to biological sciences or environmental science, not directly helpful for business or computer science.
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**: Solving puzzles could indicate a propensity for logical thinking, which is valuable in computer science. Being quiet can be associated with deep focus needed for engineering and programming tasks rather than the social interactions often required in business.
3. **Warm heart and strong empathy**: These traits are more aligned with people-oriented professions, potentially less common in computer science and business administration.
4. **Deep love for animals**: Indicates interest in biology, zoology, or environmental sciences, not typical for business or computer science.
5. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: This is crucial for both fields, perhaps slightly more for computer science given its theoretical and mathematical aspects.
6. **Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Commonly useful in any field but doesn't favor one over the other specifically.

Given these interpretations, here's an approximate value for the conditional probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

- **Business Administration**: 0.2 because some aspects like empathy and understanding hard work might fit, but the personality sketch doesn't heavily lean towards this field.
- **Computer Science**: 0.7 because the puzzle-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with the typical traits found in computer science students.

Keep in mind, these probabilities are heuristic and approximate as actual Bayesian computation would require detailed prior probabilities and likelihood data.
