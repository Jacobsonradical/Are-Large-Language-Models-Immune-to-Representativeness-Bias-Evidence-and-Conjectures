To compute the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we would typically use Bayes' theorem. However, due to the lack of precise quantitative data, we'll make qualitative assessments based on Adam's interests and attributes.

Given Adam's described qualities:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

### Likely Fields:
Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and intelligence might align him more with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Fields requiring strong abstract thinking and puzzle solving, such as mathematics or computer science, also seem fitting. His empathy and appreciation for dedication might not as strongly point toward business administration, which often emphasizes profit, management, and organizational behavior over the kind of compassion suggested in his profile.

### Qualitative Probability Assessments:
- **Computer Science**: Considering his enjoyment in solving puzzles and his high intelligence, Adam has qualities that align well with computer science, a field often characterized by problem-solving and abstract thinking.
- **Business Administration**: While he has high intelligence and an appreciation for dedication, the sketch does not strongly align with typical interests and motivations driving one toward business administration, such as leadership and strategic decision-making.

So, the probabilities based on qualitative assessments are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

This distribution reflects a stronger likelihood of Adam's personality fitting into the computer science field over business administration, given his interests and described qualities.
