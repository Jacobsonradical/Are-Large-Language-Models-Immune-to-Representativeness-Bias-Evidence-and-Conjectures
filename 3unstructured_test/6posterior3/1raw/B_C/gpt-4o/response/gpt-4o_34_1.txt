To compute the posterior conditional probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian inference. We need to consider the prior probabilities of students in each field exhibiting characteristics described in the personality sketch compared to the overall population of graduate students. 

Given:
- Adam's personality sketch suggests traits like curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence.
- In 2021, Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. 

We know that certain fields are more closely aligned to these traits. For instance, computer science students often need to have a high aptitude for abstract concepts and problem-solving. On the other hand, business administration students might be less likely to exhibit the specific traits mentioned like love for nature and animals, or a high interest in puzzles.

So, let's intuitively assign posterior probabilities that best reflect the match between Adam's traits and the general traits of students in those fields.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This means that based on the given personality sketch, there is a higher probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science compared to business administration, but these values don't necessarily mean these are the most probable fields of study overall since there could be other fields that better match his traits.
