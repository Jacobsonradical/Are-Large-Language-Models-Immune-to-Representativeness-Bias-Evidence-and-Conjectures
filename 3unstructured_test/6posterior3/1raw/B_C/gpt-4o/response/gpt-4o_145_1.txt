To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we should consider how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with typical characteristics and interests associated with various fields of study. Given that we're dealing with subjective human descriptions rather than precise data, this analysis is inherently qualitative.

### Business Administration
A typical business administration student might have interests aligned with leadership, management, finance, marketing, and organizational behavior. Business students often exhibit traits like strong interpersonal skills, interest in market trends, and project management.

Matching Adam's Traits to Business Administration:
- **High intelligence**: Relevant to all fields.
- **Understanding and appreciation for hard work**: Relevant but not specific to business.
- **Strong empathy and warm heart**: Not specifically a match with business administration.
- **Interest in nature, plants, and animals**: No significant alignment.
- **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**: Unrelated to typical business interests.

Given the less direct match with the traits and interests typically associated with business administration, the posterior conditional probability is relatively low.

### Computer Science
A computer science graduate student might have interests in areas like programming, algorithms, system design, artificial intelligence, and problem-solving. Students in computer science often have strong analytical skills and enjoy working independently or in a focused, detail-oriented manner.

Matching Adam's Traits to Computer Science:
- **High intelligence**: Highly relevant, especially abstract thinking.
- **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Strong match with problem-solving aspects of computer science.
- **Quiet**: Often common in fields requiring focused, individual work.
- **Strong empathy and warm heart**: Less directly associated but could be relevant in fields like human-computer interaction or ethical AI.
- **Love for nature, plants, and animals**: Not directly related but doesn't conflict either.

Given the strong alignment with traits like enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and being quiet, the posterior conditional probability for computer science is higher.

Based on this qualitative assessment, here's a reasonable estimate of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values reflect the higher alignment between Adam's personality traits and interests and the field of computer science compared to business administration.
