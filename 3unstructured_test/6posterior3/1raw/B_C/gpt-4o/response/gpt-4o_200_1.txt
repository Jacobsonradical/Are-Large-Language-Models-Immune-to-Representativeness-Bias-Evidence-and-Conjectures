To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration or Computer Science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. However, given that we lack specific numerical data for prior probabilities (base rates of graduate students in each field) and likelihoods (probability of this personality sketch fitting students in each field), we'll rely on intuitive reasoning based on his described traits.

### Personality Sketch Analysis:
- **Curiosity about nature and plants** – This trait suggests interests more aligned with natural sciences, biology, environmental sciences, etc., rather than business administration or computer science directly.
- **Enjoys solving puzzles** – This trait could fit well with computer science due to problem-solving nature but isn't strongly indicative of business administration.
- **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals** – These traits are not strongly indicative of either field but might point away from computer science if stereotypically considered less touchy-feely.
- **High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts** – Could fit both fields but particularly computer science due to the abstractions involved in programming and theoretical computing.
- **Appreciation for hard work and dedication** – This can be applicable to pretty much any field.

### Analysis for Each Field:
- **Business Administration**: Business administration students typically possess traits such as leadership, people management skills, and an interest in organizational dynamics. Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work fit this, but his curiosity about nature and love for animals don't strongly correlate with business administration.

- **Computer Science**: Computer science students often enjoy solving puzzles, have high intelligence, and understand abstract concepts well. Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence fit well here. His love for nature and animals is less relevant but does not discount the possibility.

Based on this qualitative analysis:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

The probabilities provided reflect a stronger fit for computer science based on the enjoyment of problem-solving and abstract thinking. Business administration is less aligned with Adam's distinct interests in nature and animals, hence the lower probability.
