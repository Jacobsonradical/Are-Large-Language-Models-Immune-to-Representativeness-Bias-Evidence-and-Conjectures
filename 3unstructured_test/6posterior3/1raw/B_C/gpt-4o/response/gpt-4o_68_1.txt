Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, I will estimate the posterior probabilities that he was enrolled in each specified graduate field. Given that Adam has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and is good at understanding abstract concepts, this aligns well with the field of computer science. On the other hand, his empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work could be attributes found in more people-oriented or possibly animal-related professions, which might detract somewhat from the likelihood of business administration.

However, please note that this assessment is subjective and based on limited information. In practice, more data would be required to compute exact probabilities. That said, based on the given description, the approximate values could be:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These estimates reflect a higher likelihood for computer science based on his intellectual interests and abilities, compared to business administration, which seems less aligned with his stated personality traits.
