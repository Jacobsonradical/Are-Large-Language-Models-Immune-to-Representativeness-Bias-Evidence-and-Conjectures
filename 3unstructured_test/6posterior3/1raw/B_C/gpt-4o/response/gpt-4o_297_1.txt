To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, since we don't have specific prior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in each field, we can make a judgment based on the characteristics outlined in his personality sketch and the typical traits associated with students in each field.

### Business Administration:
- Business Administration students often require strong social and leadership skills, with a focus on management, communication, and relatively less emphasis on nature and abstract puzzles. 
- Adam's quiet nature, love for animals, and puzzle-solving interest suggest he might be less inclined towards fields that emphasize social interactions and business acumen.

### Computer Science:
- Computer Science students often exhibit strong intelligence, enjoy solving puzzles, understand abstract concepts, and might have a quieter demeanor. Interest in nature and animals, though not directly relevant, does not contradict the personality traits of typical computer science students.
- Adamâ€™s high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and interest in solving puzzles align well with the characteristics often found in computer science students.

Considering these points:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These probabilities are not exact but reflect a general assessment based on the given personality sketch and typical traits of students in these fields. There would generally be a much lower likelihood for Adam to be in Business Administration compared to Computer Science.
