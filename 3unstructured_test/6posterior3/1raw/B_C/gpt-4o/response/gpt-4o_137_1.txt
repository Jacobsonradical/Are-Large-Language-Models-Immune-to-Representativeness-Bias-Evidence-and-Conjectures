To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we'd typically need more detailed information about the baseline probabilities of students in each field exhibiting Adam's traits. Without specific data, precise calculations are impossible. However, based on the descriptive traits in the personality sketch, we can make qualitative assessments.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Traits such as curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, and empathy are not particularly indicative of someone in business administration. While empathy and understanding hard work can be beneficial in this field, the strong inclination towards nature and abstract concepts makes it less likely.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Traits such as enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and good understanding of abstract concepts align more closely with typical characteristics associated with computer science students. While not all computer science students have a deep love for animals or strong empathy, the inclination towards abstract thinking and puzzles significantly aligns with the field of computer science.

Based on this qualitative analysis, here is a rough estimation of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are subjective and intended to reflect the alignment of Adam's traits with common characteristics associated with each field, rather than statistically derived probabilities.
