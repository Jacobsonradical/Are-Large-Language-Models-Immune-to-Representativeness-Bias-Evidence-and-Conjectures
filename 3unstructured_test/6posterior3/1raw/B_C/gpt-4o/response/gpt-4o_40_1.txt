To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to evaluate how well Adam's personality sketch matches the typical characteristics of students in each field. We should consider the relevance of his curiosity, empathy, intelligence, and other traits to each area.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Traits such as curiosity about nature, empathy, and a love for animals are not typically associated with business administration.
   - While his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be valuable, they are less specific to this field.
   - Overall, the personality sketch is not a strong match for business administration.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are very relevant to computer science.
   - Puzzle-solving indicates an aptitude for logical thinking and problem-solving, which are crucial in this field.
   - While computer science students may not typically have a strong appreciation for nature or empathy, these traits do not negatively impact the likelihood of him being in this field.

Based on this analysis, we can assign conditional probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

These values reflect the higher probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science compared to business administration, given his personality traits.
