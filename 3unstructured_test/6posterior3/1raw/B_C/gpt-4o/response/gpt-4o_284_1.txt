To calculate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well the traits mentioned align with typical characteristics of students in those fields. Since we don't have exact statistical probabilities and distributions, this will be an estimation based on qualitative analysis.

Based on the personality sketch provided:

1. Strong curiosity about nature and plants, which suggests a leaning towards biological sciences or environmental studies rather than typical interests for computer science or business administration.
2. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles, which might align somewhat with computer science due to the problem-solving nature of the field.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals, which again leans more towards biological or environmental sciences rather than business administration, which is generally less emotionally driven.
4. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which fits both computer science and potentially business administration, although more so for computer science.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication, which is a trait that can be found in any field but might be more emphasized in fields requiring rigorous study and long hours.

Given these qualitative factors, we can make the following estimations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

This suggests that given Adam's traits and interests, he is somewhat more likely to be in computer science (0.65) than in business administration (0.15), although his personality might actually be a better fit for fields related to biological sciences or environmental studies which are not included in this analysis.
