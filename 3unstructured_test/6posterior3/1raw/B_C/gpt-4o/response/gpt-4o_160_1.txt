To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics match the typical student in each field. Since this type of probability cannot be exactly computed without more specific data, I'll provide a subjective assessment based on the given description.

Adam has a love for nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has empathy and a deep love for animals, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits suggest he might be more inclined towards fields that involve critical thinking, empathy, and perhaps environmental or biological focus.

Given these traits, let's analyze the likelihood for each field:

**Business Administration:**
Typically, business administration students are characterized by traits such as leadership, strategic planning, analytical thinking related to business operations, and often a more extroverted and people-oriented nature. While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could fit, other elements of his personality don't align well with this field.

**Computer Science:**
Students in computer science often have strong problem-solving abilities, enjoy abstract and logical reasoning, and typically have a curiosity about how things work. Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, his high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with this field. Additionally, a quiet demeanor can also be common among computer science students as the field can involve substantial solitary work.

Given these considerations, here's the subjective posterior conditional probability:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

Note: These values are subjective assessments based on the personality traits provided and the general characteristics of students in each field. They do not add up to 1 because we are only considering two out of many possible fields of study.
