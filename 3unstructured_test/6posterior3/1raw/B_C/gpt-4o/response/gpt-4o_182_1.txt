To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem qualitatively, considering the alignment between Adam's personality and typical characteristics required or advantageous in each field.

1. **Business Administration**:
    - Requires strong leadership and managerial skills.
    - Often involves strategic thinking, decision-making, and human interaction.
    - Generally involves dealing with financial, marketing, and operational aspects of businesses.
    - Adam's characteristics:
        - High intelligence (relevant to any field)
        - Curiosity about nature and plants (less relevant)
        - Quiet (less typical for an MBA student)
        - Enjoys solving puzzles (relevant for strategic thinking)
        - Strong empathy and warm heart (can be relevant but not the primary attribute)
        - Deep love for animals (irrelevant)
        - Appreciation for hard work and dedication (relevant for any field)

    Since Adam's personality shows a quieter demeanor, curiosity about nature, and a deep love for animals, these traits are less directly aligned with the extroverted, leadership-driven environments typical in business administration programs. 

2. **Computer Science**:
    - Requires strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
    - Involves abstract thinking, programming, and a focus on technology.
    - Often attracts individuals who enjoy puzzles and have a deep appreciation for systematic, logical approaches to problem-solving.
    - Adam's characteristics:
        - High intelligence (relevant)
        - Curiosity about nature and plants (relevant in terms of curiosity)
        - Quiet (compatible with often introverted nature of the field)
        - Enjoys solving puzzles (highly relevant)
        - Strong empathy and warm heart (less directly relevant but useful for teamwork) 
        - Deep love for animals (irrelevant but not a negative attribute)
        - Appreciation for hard work and dedication (relevant for any field, particularly rigorous fields like computer science)

    Given Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, quiet nature, and ability to understand abstract concepts, his personality traits are more harmoniously aligned with the typical traits of computer science students.

Based on this qualitative analysis:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect a higher probability for computer science given Adam's personality traits compared to business administration.
