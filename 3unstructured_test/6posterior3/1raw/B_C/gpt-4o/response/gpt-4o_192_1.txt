To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science based on his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(A) \) and likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) for business administration and computer science students that match Adam's personality characteristics, we can only estimate these probabilities qualitatively.

Considering Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted, empathetic, a deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

**Business Administration:**
- Business administration students might generally be expected to have skills in leadership, management, and economics.
- Empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work could fit, but genuine curiosity about nature and solving puzzles may be less directly relevant.

**Computer Science:**
- Computer science students are often characterized by a strong interest in solving puzzles, logic, and abstract thinking.
- High intelligence, problem-solving skills, and interest in abstract concepts align well with typical characteristics of computer science students.

Given these qualitative assessments, our conditional probabilities might look like this:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values reflect the stronger alignment of Adamâ€™s personality traits with a typical computer science student as opposed to a business administration student.
