To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field, given his personality traits, let's consider how well his described characteristics align with typical traits associated with those fields. 

For business administration:
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Neutral or weakly negative alignment.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: This could align somewhat, as problem-solving is important in business strategy.
- Warm heart, strong empathy: Can be beneficial, particularly in areas like human resources and management.
- Love for animals: Typically neutral in this context.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Positively aligns, as critical thinking and analysis are necessary.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Positively aligns, as business studies often require a strong work ethic.

For computer science:
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Neutral or weakly negative alignment.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Strong alignment, as problem-solving is a core part of programming and algorithm design.
- Warm heart, strong empathy: Neutral to weak alignment, as it is not a key trait for technical roles.
- Love for animals: Neutral in this context.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Strong alignment, as computer science involves a lot of abstract thinking.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Positively aligns, as computer science programs are rigorous and demanding.

Given these alignments, we can derive an approximate probability that reflects how well these descriptions fit the fields.

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These values are estimates based on the qualitative assessment of Adam's traits relative to these fields. The specific field could belong to other academic disciplines aligning more closely with his interests in nature and animals, such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies, but we are focused on business administration and computer science in this analysis.
