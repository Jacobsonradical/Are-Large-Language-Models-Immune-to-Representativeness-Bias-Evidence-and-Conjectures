To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we'd generally need detailed prior probabilities and likelihoods, which we don't have explicitly. Thus, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch and common attributes associated with students in these fields.

1. **Computer Science**: Adam demonstrates traits like high intelligence, a love for solving puzzles, and an affinity for abstract concepts, which are often associated with students in computer science. On the other hand, his deep love for nature and animals is less typical but not unheard of in this field.

2. **Business Administration**: Adam's personality traits such as strong empathy and a warm heart could be beneficial in business administration, especially in roles that involve heavy interaction with people and HR. However, his otherwise introverted nature and his deep focus on nature and animals make it less likely than computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can present the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```
