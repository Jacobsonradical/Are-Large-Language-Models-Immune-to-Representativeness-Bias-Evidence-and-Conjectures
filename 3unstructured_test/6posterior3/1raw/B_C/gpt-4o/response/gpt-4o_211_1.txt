To determine the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to evaluate how well Adam's personality sketch fits typical personalities in the fields of Business Administration and Computer Science. This involves applying principles from Bayesian reasoning. However, without prior probabilities and specific likelihood functions, we'll make educated guesses based on common characteristics associated with each field.

Let's break down characteristics associated with each field and compare them to Adam's profile:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Typically associated with leadership, management skills, and often involves significant interaction with people, making presentations, and handling finances.
   - While intelligence is important, the focus is generally on interpersonal and organizational skills.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Involves a strong emphasis on abstract theoretical concepts, problem-solving, and often requires less interaction with people compared to Business Administration.
   - Valued traits include intelligence, logical thinking, attention to detail, and often a love for puzzles and abstract challenges.

Given Adam's characteristics:
- High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts.
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals hint at a caring nature, which can fit various roles but does not strongly align with a high-pressure business environment.
- Curiosity about nature and plants suggests a broader interest in scientific inquiry.

Based on the personality traits provided, Adam seems to fit more naturally in Computer Science than in Business Administration. Here is a rough estimation of the probabilities based on these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are not definitive as they are derived from qualitative reasoning and not statistical computation, but they reflect Adam's alignment more closely with the typical traits valued in Computer Science over Business Administration.
