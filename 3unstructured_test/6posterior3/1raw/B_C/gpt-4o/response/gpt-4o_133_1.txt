To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science based on the given personality sketch, we'll need to consider how well each field aligns with the characteristics presented.

Given traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Quiet disposition.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles.
- Warm heart and strong empathy.
- Deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Let's analyze how these traits align with business administration and computer science.

1. **Business Administration**:
    - Business administration typically requires strong leadership skills, interpersonal skills, and often involves working with people, managing teams, and understanding business dynamics. Empathy and appreciation for hard work could be relevant, but the other traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and solving abstract puzzles don't strongly indicate a fit for business administration.

2. **Computer Science**:
    - Computer science is well-aligned with problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts. A quiet disposition can fit well with long hours of focused work, such as coding. High intelligence is also a significant trait for understanding complex algorithms and computational theories. While empathy and love for animals are not directly relevant, they don't detract from this match either.

Given the above alignment, it's more likely Adam's personality and interests match better with computer science than with business administration. However, since probabilities need to be assigned, here's an estimation:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This consideration takes into account that other fields may also match Adam's personality more closely. Thus, while business administration is less probable given the traits, computer science is notably more probable but still leaves room for other fields that align even better with his interests in nature and animals.
