To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, one approach is using Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of event A occurring given that B is true.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of event B occurring given that A is true.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event A.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of event B.

The application of Bayes' theorem here involves subjective estimation because we lack specific numerical data about the distributions of personality traits across different graduate fields.

Let's consider the traits described:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are strong indications.
   - Enjoying solving puzzles is also relevant.
   - A quiet disposition can often be found among people who prefer work requiring concentration and analysis, common in computer science.
   
2. **Business Administration**:
   - Empathy and a warm heart could be traits useful for leadership and management.
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are applicable, though they are less specific to this field alone.

Without concrete numerical priors, we'll make a qualitative assessment based on these observations. It's reasonable to think that Adam's personality aligns more closely with the characteristics typically associated with computer science than with business administration.

Based on the qualitative analysis:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect a higher posterior probability for computer science given Adam's interest in solving puzzles, abstract thinking capabilities, and quiet demeanor. However, his empathy and appreciation for hard work could still make business administration a plausible field, though less likely based on the sketch provided.
