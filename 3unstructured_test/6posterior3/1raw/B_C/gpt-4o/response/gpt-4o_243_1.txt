To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in its simplest form can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field (A) given his personality sketch (B).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Adam having his personality traits given that he's in a specific field.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that specific field.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Adam having his particular personality traits.

While we may not have specific numerical values for \( P(A) \), \( P(B|A) \), or \( P(B) \), we can estimate them qualitatively based on typical characteristics associated with each field.

Given:

- Adam has a high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
- He has a quiet nature, likes solving puzzles, has a warm heart, empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Let's consider:

1. **Business Administration**: Typically, this field might attract individuals with strong leadership qualities, a strong focus on management, people, and organizational structures. Empathy and understanding dedication can apply here. However, a strong interest in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts might be less common among business administration students.

2. **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals who enjoy solving puzzles, have high intelligence, and appreciate abstract concepts. Computer scientists might also value dedication (due to the rigorous nature of the field), and a quiet disposition can be common. Empathy and a deep love for animals are not directly related but do not conflict with being a computer science student.

Let's approximate the probabilities qualitatively:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

These values are based on qualitative assessments, where Adam's interest in puzzles, abstract concepts, and his quiet nature weigh more towards a field like computer science. Empathy and a love for animals might lower the fit for business administration slightly, but not drastically as those traits can still be valuable in any field. The values are meant to reflect the relatively higher alignment of Adam's personality with computer science compared to business administration.
