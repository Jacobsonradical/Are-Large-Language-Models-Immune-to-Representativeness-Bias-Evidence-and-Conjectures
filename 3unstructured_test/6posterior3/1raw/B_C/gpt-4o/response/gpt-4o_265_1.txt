Given the information in Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses on his likely field of study based on attributes that align with certain graduate fields. 

For example, Adamâ€™s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, high empathy, and strong intelligence suggest that he might be more inclined toward fields that involve understanding and interacting with nature, as well as scientific inquiry, which can be associated with certain areas within computer science (like bioinformatics) but not strongly with business administration. His appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to various fields but doesn't strongly point towards business administration over other fields.

Let's take "business administration" and "computer science" specifically into consideration:

- **Business Administration**: While business administration does require intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts, it is less aligned with traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and a preference for quiet puzzle-solving. Business administration tends to attract individuals who are more focused on leadership, management, and organizational dynamics.

- **Computer Science**: Computer science, particularly the aspects involving puzzles, abstract concepts, and potentially nature-related fields like bioinformatics or ecological modeling, aligns more closely with Adam's traits. Computer science often involves quiet work that requires strong problem-solving skills and deep thinking, which fits well with Adam's stated characteristics.

While exact probabilities are inherently subjective without more robust statistical data, we can qualitatively infer the likelihoods. Assuming other factors and graduate fields also exist, the computed probabilities for the given fields might be represented as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

This assumes that there are other fields not accounted for that align even more closely with Adam's personality sketch, such as environmental sciences or biology. The given probabilities thus reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being in computer science relative to business administration, but leave room for other even more related fields.
