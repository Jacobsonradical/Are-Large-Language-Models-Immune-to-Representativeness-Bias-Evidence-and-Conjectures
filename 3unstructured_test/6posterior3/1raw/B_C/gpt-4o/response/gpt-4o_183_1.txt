To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider the alignment of his traits with the typical characteristics associated with each field. This involves subjective judgment, as exact probabilities would require detailed statistical data. Nevertheless, I can provide a reasoned estimation based on the information given:

1. **Business Administration:**
    - Traits like "genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants," "strong empathy," and "deep love for animals" do not strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student.
    - While high intelligence and an appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant, his traits point more towards a field associated with nature, problem-solving, and empathy.

2. **Computer Science:**
    - A curiosity about nature, being good at solving puzzles, high intelligence, and a strong understanding of abstract concepts align well with the interests and skills typical of computer science students.
    - However, his empathy and love for animals are not specifically relevant to computer science, but do not necessarily detract from it either.

Based on these considerations, my estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This estimate reflects that while it is possible Adam could be in business administration due to his intelligence and work ethic, his stronger fit with problem-solving and abstract thinking suggests a greater likelihood he is in computer science.
