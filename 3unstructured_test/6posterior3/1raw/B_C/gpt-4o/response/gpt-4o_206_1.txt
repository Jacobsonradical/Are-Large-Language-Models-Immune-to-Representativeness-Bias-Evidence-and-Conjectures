To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either Business Administration or Computer Science given his personality sketch, we can apply Bayes' Theorem qualitatively.

Given Adam's strong empathy, appreciation for hard work, and deep love for animals and nature, it seems unlikely that he would be inclined towards Business Administration, which often emphasizes management, finance, operations, and marketing skills. On the other hand, his interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could align with Computer Science, which involves problem-solving, logic, and abstract thinking. 

Let's break down the two fields qualitatively:
1. **Business Administration**:
   - Not closely aligned with Adam's stated curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals.
   - Less emphasis on solving puzzles and abstract concepts.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Aligns well with Adamâ€™s interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.
   - May also accommodate his quiet nature and intelligence.

Considering the qualitative analysis, the posterior probabilities might look as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood that Adam would be enrolled in Computer Science compared to Business Administration based on his personality sketch.
