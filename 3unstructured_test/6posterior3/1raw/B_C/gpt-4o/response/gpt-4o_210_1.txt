To compute the posterior probabilities, we will make use of Bayesian reasoning. Specifically, we're interested in:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where:

- \( P(A | B) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is in a particular field given his personality sketch (B).
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a particular field.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch overall.

Let's assume that without any other information, the prior probabilities for Adam being in computer science or business administration are moderate and roughly equal compared to other graduate fields, just to simplify the calculations.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Traits such as problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and abstract thinking align well with what is often observed in computer science students.
   - Empathy and love for animals might not be as strongly correlated but don't necessarily disqualify someone from being in this field.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Empathy, understanding, and appreciation for hard work align well with what might be expected in business administration.
   - However, dedication to nature and love for animals may not be as strongly correlated with business administration.

Given these qualitative alignments:

\[ \text{P(B | Computer Science)} \]
- High problem-solving: high likelihood
- High intelligence: high likelihood
- Abstract thinking: high likelihood
- Emphasis on empathy and animals: moderate likelihood

\[ \text{P(B | Business Administration)} \]
- Empathy and hard work: high likelihood
- Love for nature and animals: moderate to low likelihood in this context
- Problem-solving and abstract thinking: moderate to significant likelihood, depending on the focus area

Though without making exact mathematical calculations due to the need for extensive domain-specific statistical data, qualitatively judged, we can estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

These values are heuristic and derived based on typical correlations between personality traits and field characteristics. They don't sum up to 1 intentionally, given that Adam might be enrolled in other possible graduate fields.
