To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science or Business Administration, we will use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of A given B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of B.

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science.
- \( BA \) as the event that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration.
- \( PS \) as the event described by Adam's personality sketch.

We need:
1. \( P(PS|CS) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits a typical Computer Science student.
2. \( P(PS|BA) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits a typical Business Administration student.
3. \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that any random graduate student is in Computer Science.
4. \( P(BA) \): The prior probability that any random graduate student is in Business Administration.
5. \( P(PS) \): The total probability of Adam's personality sketch (which can be complex to compute and is not necessary for comparative purposes since we only need the relative probabilities).

We don't have specific statistics for these probabilities, but we can make educated estimates based on general knowledge about typical attributes of Computer Science and Business Administration students:

1. \( P(PS|CS) \): Adam's qualities like curiosity about nature, intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles suggest he might fit well with many Computer Science students who often have similar traits.
2. \( P(PS|BA) \): Empathy, appreciation for hard work, and a warm heart are valuable traits for Business Administration students, but Adam's interest in nature and solving puzzles is less typical for this field.

Given these considerations, we can qualitatively assess:

- \( P(PS|CS) \) (Likelihood for Computer Science) might be relatively high.
- \( P(PS|BA) \) (Likelihood for Business Administration) might be lower.

Regarding U.S. graduate student distributions:
- \( P(CS) \) (Prior for Computer Science) is generally quite significant as it's a popular field.
- \( P(BA) \) (Prior for Business Administration) is also significant but should be slightly adjusted based on the general interest distribution.

Assumptions (for illustrative purposes):
- \( P(CS) \approx 0.25 \)
- \( P(BA) \approx 0.20 \) (Graduate programs often have diverse distributions)

Estimates for likelihoods:
- \( P(PS|CS) \approx 0.60 \) (Quite fitting)
- \( P(PS|BA) \approx 0.30 \) (Less fitting)

Using Bayes' theorem comparatively, we don't need the exact total probability:

\[ 
P(CS|PS) \propto P(PS|CS) \cdot P(CS) \approx 0.60 \times 0.25 = 0.15 
\]
\[ 
P(BA|PS) \propto P(PS|BA) \cdot P(BA) \approx 0.30 \times 0.20 = 0.06 
\]

Normalized:

\[
\text{normalizing constant} = 0.15 + 0.06 = 0.21
\]

Therefore:
\[
P(CS|PS) = \frac{0.15}{0.21} \approx 0.71
\]
\[
P(BA|PS) = \frac{0.06}{0.21} \approx 0.29
\]

However, our problem allows comparison without normalization. Thus, the values can be directly used for ranking likelihood.

The results are:
```
{
  "computer science": 0.71,
  "business administration": 0.29
}
```
