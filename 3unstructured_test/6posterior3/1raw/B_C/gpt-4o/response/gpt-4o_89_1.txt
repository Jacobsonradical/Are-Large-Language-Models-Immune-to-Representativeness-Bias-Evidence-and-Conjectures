To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the fields given his personality sketch, we need to take into account the alignment of his traits and interests with the typical characteristics and requirements of each field. This involves analyzing the fit of Adam's personality traits with both business administration and computer science.

### Business Administration:
1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants:** This trait does not strongly align with business administration.
2. **Quiet:** This could fit or not fit, depending on specific roles within business.
3. **Enjoys solving puzzles:** Could fit into strategic problem-solving but is less directly relevant.
4. **Warm heart and strong empathy:** While useful for leadership and HR, not a core characteristic for business administration.
5. **Deep love for animals:** Generally unrelated to business administration.
6. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts:** Useful across many fields, including business, but not exclusively.
7. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** This is useful in any field, including business.

### Computer Science:
1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants:** Generally unrelated but demonstrates a scientific curiosity that could translate into an interest in computational problems.
2. **Quiet:** Often seen in the field where independent work is common.
3. **Enjoys solving puzzles:** Directly relevant, as computer science often involves problem-solving and logical thinking.
4. **Warm heart and strong empathy:** Less directly relevant but can be useful in team projects and user-focused design.
5. **Deep love for animals:** Generally unrelated unless focusing on specific applications (e.g., bioinformatics).
6. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts:** Highly relevant as theoretical and abstract thinking are crucial in computer science.
7. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** Essential for success in computer science-related projects and research.

Based on this analysis, Adam's traits align more heavily with the requirements and nature of the field of computer science than with business administration. Therefore, the conditional probability that he was enrolled in computer science would be higher.

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

These scores reflect that while some of Adam's traits could be applicable to business administration, they are overall a much better fit for computer science. These are estimates and could vary depending on additional context or more detailed personality traits.
