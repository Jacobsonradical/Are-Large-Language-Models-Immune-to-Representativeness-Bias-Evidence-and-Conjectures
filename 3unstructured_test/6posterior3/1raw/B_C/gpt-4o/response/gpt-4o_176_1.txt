The personality sketch of Adam describes qualities and interests that align him more closely with certain fields compared to others. Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and strong appreciation for hard work, we can infer probabilities for the fields of business administration and computer science as follows:

- Business administration typically attracts individuals interested in market strategies, organizational behavior, and economic principles, which may not directly align with Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals.

- Computer science appeals to individuals with a high level of intelligence and those who enjoy solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which align well with Adam's described characteristics. However, it does not directly align with his love for animals and nature.

Given these considerations, here is the posterior conditional probability for each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These probabilities reflect Adam's stronger alignment with the intellectual profile common to computer science students compared to the interests typical of business administration students. Nonetheless, his love for nature and animals might suggest a yet different field like biology, environmental science, or another nature-related discipline.
