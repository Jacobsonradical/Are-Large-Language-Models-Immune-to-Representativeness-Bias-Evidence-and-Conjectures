To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration, we need to use Bayesian inference. Here, the likelihood of Adam's personality matching each field's typical student profiles is subject to interpretation and external data (which we do not have). However, based on general reasoning, we can assign subjective probabilities.

### Step-by-Step Approach:
1. **Identify Traits Relevant to Each Field:**
   - **Computer Science (CS):**
     - Enjoys solving puzzles
     - High intelligence and abstract reasoning
     - Curiosity about nature and problem-solving

   - **Business Administration (BA):**
     - Strong empathy
     - Warm heart
     - Appreciation for hard work and dedication
     - (Less directly linked to solving puzzles or abstract reasoning)

2. **Determine Likelihoods (subjectively):**
   - Students in CS are often analytical, enjoy problem-solving, and good at abstract concepts.
   - MBA students may value empathy, leadership, and understanding dedication, though abstract reasoning is less central.

3. **Normalizing These Likelihoods:**
   With these considerations, a subjective probability can be estimated as:
   - CS: High likelihood due to traits favoring analytical and abstract reasoning.
   - BA: Moderate likelihood due to empathy and dedication being valued but less match with puzzle-solving.

### Bayesian Updates (prior subjective estimates without detailed data):
Prior probabilities (before seeing the personality sketch):
- Let's initially assume any field has an equal probability: P(CS) = P(BA) = 1 / N.

Posterior probabilities (subjective update based on sketch):
- CS fits many more traits provided in the sketch, so P(CS | personality) > P(BA | personality).

### Assigning Subjective Values:
Let's assign higher subjective values based on the match.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```
**Note:** These values are subjective and illustrate how one might prioritize the fit based on personality traits without precise data on graduate field distributions. These posterior probabilities could differ significantly with additional external data points, quantifying exact matches of traits to fields.
