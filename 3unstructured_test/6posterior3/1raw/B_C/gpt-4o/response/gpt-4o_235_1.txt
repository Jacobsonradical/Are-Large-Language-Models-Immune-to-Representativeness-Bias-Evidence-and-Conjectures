To compute the posterior conditional probability for Adam based on his personality sketch, we need to consider how the given traits align with the characteristics typically associated with students in the fields of computer science and business administration. Please note this will be more of an estimation than a precise calculation as we are using qualitative analysis.

### Traits Analysis:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants**: This trait isn't directly related to computer science but shows a tendency towards systematic study, which can be linked to scientific inquiry.
   - **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Highly relevant, as problem-solving is a core aspect of computer science.
   - **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: Very relevant, as computer science requires strong abstract thinking and intellectual ability.
   - **Empathy and love for animals**: Not directly related, but doesn't contradict the personality fit for computer science.
   - **Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Relevant, as computer science often requires rigorous and persistent effort.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants**: Not directly related, though curiosity is a good trait for any field.
   - **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Relevant, as business problems can often be complex and require innovative solutions.
   - **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: Relevant, as business strategy often involves abstract thinking.
   - **Empathy and love for animals**: More relevant for business administration, as empathy is crucial for management and human resource aspects.
   - **Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Highly relevant, as business administration demands commitment and hard work.

Given these considerations, we can now estimate the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.7)**: Adam's love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are highly indicative of a field that involves rigorous analytical and abstract problem-solving, which is central to computer science.
- **Business Administration (0.3)**: Although he has traits like empathy, strong work ethic, and dedication which fit well with business administration, the direct links to the technical and problem-solving nature of computer science appear stronger.

These values are rough estimates and should be considered in light of the qualitative alignment of Adam's traits with common characteristics of students in each field.
