To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem. However, we are dealing with qualitative data, and exact prior probabilities are not provided, so we'll have to rely on typical characteristics associated with each field and Adam's described traits.

Based on Adam's personality sketch, let's assess the fit for each field qualitatively:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and strong understanding of abstract concepts are important in computer science.
   - Enjoyment in solving puzzles aligns well with the problem-solving nature of computer science.
   - While a strong appreciation for dedication can suit any demanding field, computer science often involves long hours of focused, detailed work.
   
2. **Business Administration**:
   - Business administration often requires strong leadership, social skills, and a good understanding of various business functions.
   - High intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant, but the personality sketch emphasizes empathy and a love for animals more than people-oriented or leadership traits.

Considering these qualitative assessments, here's an approximate posterior probability for each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the likelihood that Adamâ€™s personality traits and interests align more closely with computer science than business administration. The values do not add up to 1, acknowledging that there could be better-fitting fields not considered here.
