To determine the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration, we need to consider how his personality traits align with typical traits and interests of students in these respective fields. We will use Bayesian reasoning, which, in the absence of specific priors, will be simplified to a qualitative assessment.

Here’s a brief analysis based on Adam’s personality sketch:
- **Computer Science**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests common in computer science. Also, his quiet nature and curiosity about understanding systems could fit well within this field.
- **Business Administration**: While Adam has a strong appreciation for dedication and hard work, which are relevant to business administration, the other traits (empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature) are not as strong indicators of this field.

Based on this analysis, we can infer qualitative probabilities:
- **Computer Science**: Higher likelihood due to aligned traits (high intelligence, problem-solving, abstract thinking).
- **Business Administration**: Lower likelihood due to less alignment with his empathy and nature curiosity traits.

In numerical terms, and without specific data, I can suggest the following approximate values:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values suggest that, based on Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration.
