To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either "computer science" or "business administration" given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well the profile matches common characteristics of students in each field, along with any prior probability of enrollment in these fields. However, since we lack concrete priors, we'll base our analysis primarily on the characteristics described.

### Posterior Computation Based on Profile Matching:
1. **Computer Science**:
    - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science.
    - Enjoying solving puzzles also aligns with the problem-solving nature of computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - Strong empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work are qualities beneficial in business administration, which requires good interpersonal and leadership skills.

Given Adam's profile, we'll assign subjective probabilities.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

The reasoning behind these values is:
- **Computer Science** (0.7): The traits of high intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding of abstract concepts strongly suggest a fit with this field.
- **Business Administration** (0.3): While empathy and appreciation for hard work fit, the core traits (intelligence, abstract thinking) are slightly more aligned with computer science. 

These values are estimative and should be refined with additional data or more rigorous probabilistic methods if more context were available.
