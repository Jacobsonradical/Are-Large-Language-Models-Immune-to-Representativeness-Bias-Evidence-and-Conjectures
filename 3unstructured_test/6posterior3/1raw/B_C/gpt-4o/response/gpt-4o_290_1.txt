To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality traits match the typical attributes of graduate students in computer science and business administration.

Here is the reasoning:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles (common trait for computer science students).
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts (aligns well with the demanding and theoretical nature of computer science).
   - Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication (necessary for the rigorous work in computer science).

   Based on the alignment of traits, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is high.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Strong empathy and warm heart (important for leadership, human resources, and management roles in business administration).
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work (essential for the demanding and competitive environment of business administration).

   Adam does have qualities that match business administration, though these traits alone are somewhat more generic compared to the specialized traits required for computer science.

Given that his personality strongly aligns with the traits typically associated with computer science students and that business administration aligns slightly less:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

This assessment reflects a higher probability for computer science due to the more specific alignment of his traits with that field, while still acknowledging some overlap with business administration.
