To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we can use Bayes' Theorem. However, we do not have explicit base rates or likelihood values for each field. Instead, we can make educated estimates based on the provided personality sketch.

Adam's qualities such as his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals suggest a higher affinity for fields related to biology, environmental science, or similar areas than business administration or computer science. However, let's focus on the fields given:

### Business Administration
Adam is described as a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles, has empathy, and a warm heart. While these traits are valuable in business, they are not typically the primary or strongest indicators for someone pursuing a degree in business administration. Business fields often attract individuals who are more extroverted, with interests in management, economics, and leadership rather than a quiet interest in nature and animals.

### Computer Science
Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts. These qualities are relevant and beneficial in computer science, which often involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and logical reasoning. However, the personality sketch puts a stronger emphasis on his love for nature and animals, which is less typical for someone in the computer science field.

Considering Adams characteristics and the provided fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These are approximate probabilities highlighting that Adamâ€™s personality seems less indicative of someone pursuing a degree in business administration, and slightly more aligned with computer science, though his greater affinity for nature and animals suggests he might more likely be in a different field altogether.
