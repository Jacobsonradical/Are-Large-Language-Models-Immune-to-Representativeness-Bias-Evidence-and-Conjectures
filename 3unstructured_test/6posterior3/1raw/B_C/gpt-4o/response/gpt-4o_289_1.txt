Reasoning:
- Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature, and his love for animals, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a business administration program since these programs typically focus on management, finance, and organizational behavior.
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has a high intelligence, and understands abstract concepts, which are traits more commonly associated with fields like computer science. Although he has an appreciation for hard work and dedication, this could apply to multiple fields, including computer science, which demands these traits.
- The probabilities reflect the higher likelihood of Adam being in a field that aligns more closely with his personality traits and interests.
