Given Adam's personality sketch, we can compute the posterior probabilities for each field by considering which traits are typically associated with each field. This is a simplified representation and doesn't take into account all factors or real-world data, but it can provide a rough estimate.

For computer science:
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators.
- Enjoying solving puzzles aligns well with the problem-solving nature of computer science.
- A curiosity about nature and plants, while not directly related, does not preclude computer science and can sometimes correlate with algorithmic thinking or bioinformatics.

For business administration:
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts can also apply here.
- A warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals may be less directly related to business administration but could suggest roles in corporate social responsibility or ethical business practices.
- A strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant to both fields but perhaps more so to the demanding and dynamic environment of business administration.

Considering these factors:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Here, we assume that Adam's affinity for intelligence, abstract thinking, and solving puzzles creates a stronger case for computer science compared to business administration, though his empathy and understanding of hard work are indeed valuable in the latter as well.
