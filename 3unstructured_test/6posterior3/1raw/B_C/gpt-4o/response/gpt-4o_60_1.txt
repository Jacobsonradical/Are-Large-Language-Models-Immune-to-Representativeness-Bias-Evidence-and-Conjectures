To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we need to incorporate both base rates (priors) of students in these fields and how well the personality traits align with the expected profiles of students in these fields. However, due to the absence of specific base rates and dependence on subjective assessment of personality fit, a purely Bayesian calculation is not straightforward. Here, we will make a reasoned assessment based on the given personality sketch and typical profiles of students in these fields:

1. Business Administration: 
   - Typically attracts individuals who are interested in management, entrepreneurship, finance, and related areas.
   - Personality traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy do not strongly align with common traits for business administration students.
   - Abstract reasoning does have relevance but may not be specifically indicative.

2. Computer Science:
   - Attracts individuals with interests in problem-solving, puzzles, abstract concepts, and often a quieter demeanor.
   - Adamâ€™s high intelligence and an affinity for solving puzzles align better with the profile of a computer science student.
   - Curiosity about nature and empathy might not be as relevant but do not conflict significantly.

Based on these considerations, we assign likelihood values based on the rough qualitative fit:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

These values suggest a stronger fit for computer science over business administration given the described personality traits, understanding that these values are heuristic and not precise probability calculations.
