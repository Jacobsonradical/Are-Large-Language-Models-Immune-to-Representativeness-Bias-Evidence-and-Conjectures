To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Given Adam's personality sketch, we need to consider how likely these traits are in someone studying business administration versus computer science. Since we lack specific numerical data, I'll assign qualitative assessments based on typical associations of personality traits with these fields.

### Likelihood Assessment:

**Business Administration**:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants: Uncommon
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Neutral
- Warm heart, strong empathy: Relatively common
- Deep love for animals: Uncommon
- High intelligence: Relatively common
- Good at understanding abstract concepts: Neutral
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Common

**Computer Science**:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants: Uncommon
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Common
- Warm heart, strong empathy: Less common
- Deep love for animals: Uncommon
- High intelligence: Very common
- Good at understanding abstract concepts: Very common
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Very common

Given the qualitative assessments above, here's an informal posterior probability estimation:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These values reflect the better alignment of Adam's traits (particularly puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence) with computer science over business administration. However, note that values do not sum to 1 because there are other potential fields Adam could have been enrolled in, such as biology or environmental science, given his interest in nature and plants.
