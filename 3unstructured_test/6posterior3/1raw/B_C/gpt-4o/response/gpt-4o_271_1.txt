To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam being enrolled in either Computer Science or Business Administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics align with typical students in those fields. We'll apply our subjective judgment based on the information given.

1. **Computer Science**: A high level of intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators for a field like Computer Science. Enjoyment in solving puzzles is also a trait commonly associated with individuals in computer science, as the discipline often involves problem-solving and logical thinking.

2. **Business Administration**: While Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could be seen in business administration students, his deep love for animals, empathy, and warm heart do not strongly correlate with typical characteristics associated with this field. Also, the focus on puzzles and abstract concepts leans more towards disciplines like Computer Science rather than Business Administration.

Thus, based on the provided personality sketch and the typical characteristics of students in both fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are subjective estimates reflecting how well his personality traits align with the typical characteristics of students in each field.
