To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we would typically use Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods for Adam being in each field, we can only make qualitative assessments based on the provided information.

Adam's warm-hearted nature, empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature seem to align more with fields related to natural sciences or social sciences. However, his interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts could fit well in computer science. Business administration typically favors individuals with strong leadership and communication skills, which aren't directly highlighted in Adam's personality sketch.

Given this, we can make a qualitative estimation:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These values suggest that based on Adam's personality traits, he is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration, but other fields might be even more likely matches for his interests and traits.
