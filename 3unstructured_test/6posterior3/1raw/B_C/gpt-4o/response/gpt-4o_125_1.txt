To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics match typical profiles of students in each of these fields.

Given:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence with good understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Now, let's analyze these traits in relation to the fields of computer science and business administration:

### Analysis:
1. **Computer Science:**
   - A genuine interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.
   - High intelligence is often required in computer science due to the technical and abstract nature of the field.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication is also a good match.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Empathy and a warm heart are beneficial in business administration, as successful business leaders often need to manage people and understand their needs.
   - High intelligence and an appreciation for hard work and dedication are also relevant here.
   - However, the curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in plants do not particularly align with the typical traits associated with business administration.

Given Adam's characteristics, the profile seems to align more closely with computer science, particularly due to his problem-solving skills and interest in abstract concepts. While empathy and dedication are useful traits in business administration, his specific interests in nature and animals do not strongly suggest this field.

### Conditional Probability Estimates:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are based on the qualitative assessment of how well Adam's personality fits with each of these fields. Note that the sum does not equal 1, acknowledging the possibility that Adam could be in another field not considered here.
