To compute the conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields based on his personality sketch, one would typically use Bayesian inference. Here's a simplified conceptual estimation based on the details provided:

Characteristics relevant to Computer Science:
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- High intelligence
- Good at understanding abstract concepts
- Genuine curiosity

Characteristics relevant to Business Administration:
- Warm heart, strong empathy
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

Given these characteristics, Adam's profile aligns more closely with fields requiring analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are typically associated with Computer Science. However, empathy and appreciation for hard work are valuable in Business Administration as well.

Based on these considerations, here's the posterior estimated probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.35
}

These values represent a subjective estimation given the described characteristics of Adam.
