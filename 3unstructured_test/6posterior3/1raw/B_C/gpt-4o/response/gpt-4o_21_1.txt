To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we must consider which aspects of his personality align with the typical requirements and traits beneficial for each field. However, these computations are inherently qualitative and subjective. Probability values in this context will be based on educated estimations rather than strict numerical derivations.

Given the personality sketch, letâ€™s consider:

**Computer Science**:
- High intelligence and abstract thinking are beneficial for understanding complex algorithms and theories.
- Enjoying solving puzzles aligns well with debugging and problem-solving tasks common in programming and algorithm design.

**Business Administration**:
- Strong empathy and a warm heart can contribute to good leadership and management skills, which are valuable in business.
- Appreciation for hard work aligns with the dedication required in business roles.
- However, his quiet nature may not always align with the often outwardly social and communicative demands of business administration roles.

Estimated posterior probabilities based on the above qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values suggest that Adam is somewhat more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration based on his personality traits.
