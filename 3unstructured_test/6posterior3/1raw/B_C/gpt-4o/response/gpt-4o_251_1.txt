To compute the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits align with those fields. Let's break it down based on the provided personality sketch and typical characteristics required in each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Very intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles.
   - High intelligence aligns well with computer science.
   
2. **Business Administration:**
   - Empathy and understanding of hard work/dedication.
   - Strong appreciation for the hard work could be beneficial in business.
   - Business administration typically requires less alignment with solving puzzles and abstract concepts compared to computer science.

Given Adam's proclivity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts—traits that are highly valued in computer science but not typically necessary in business administration—his personality seems to align more closely with computer science. Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is higher than the probability that he was enrolled in business administration.

Let's assign approximate probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values reflect that Adam's interests and traits are more likely to lead him toward computer science rather than business administration. The remaining probability (0.1) would be distributed among other possible fields of study that might match Adam's profile.
