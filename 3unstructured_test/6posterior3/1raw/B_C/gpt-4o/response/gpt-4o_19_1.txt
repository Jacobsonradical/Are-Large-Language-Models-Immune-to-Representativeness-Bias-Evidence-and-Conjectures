To compute the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the fields of computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we can utilize Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Prior Probability (P(Field))**: The general likelihood of a graduate student being in either computer science or business administration. Let's denote these as \(P(CS)\) and \(P(BA)\). Without specific data, we'll assume these fields have reasonable popularity among graduate students but specific values can be arbitrary for this example.

2. **Likelihood (P(Personality|Field))**: The probability of the personality traits given the field. This quantifies how likely it is someone with Adam's personality would choose each field.

3. **Evidence (P(Personality))**: The overall probability of the personality description across all fields. Since we don't have this specific information, we'll assume itâ€™s normalized equally across all fields for this example.

Given the traits provided, the following can be inferred:
- Curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals point less towards computer science and business administration.
- High intelligence and good at abstract concepts could be beneficial for computer science.
- Understanding hard work and dedication is a neutral trait that applies broadly.

Let's provide estimated likelihoods based on these inferences:

- For computer science (\(P(Personality|CS)\)):
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: low (0.2)
  - Solving puzzles and abstract concepts: high (0.8)
  - Empathy and love for animals: moderate (0.4)
  - Overall combined likelihood: \(0.4\) (assuming equal weighting for simplicity)

- For business administration (\(P(Personality|BA)\)):
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: low (0.2)
  - Solving puzzles and abstract concepts: moderate (0.5)
  - Empathy and love for animals: moderate/high (0.6)
  - Overall combined likelihood: \(0.43\) (assuming equal weighting for simplicity)

Now, given equal prior probabilities for computer science and business administration, we can simplify Bayes' theorem to compare posteriors directly:

\[
P(CS | Personality) \propto P(Personality | CS) \cdot P(CS)
\]
\[
P(BA | Personality) \propto P(Personality | BA) \cdot P(BA)
\]

With normalized priors \(P(CS) = P(BA) = 0.5\) (for simplification):

\[
P(CS | Personality) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.5 = 0.2
\]
\[
P(BA | Personality) \propto 0.43 \cdot 0.5 = 0.215
\]

Normalizing (not necessary here since we only need individual values):
\[
P(CS | Personality) = 0.2
\]
\[
P(BA | Personality) = 0.215
\]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.215
}
``` 

Note: These are estimations based on given descriptions and typical field characteristics. Actual probabilities would depend on more specific data about field distributions and detailed personality-to-field mappings.
