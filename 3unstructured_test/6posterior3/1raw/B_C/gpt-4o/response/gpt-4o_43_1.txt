To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we need to consider the transferability of his personality traits to these fields and the typical characteristics of students in each field. Although we won't use precise Bayesian formulas without more data, we can use qualitative reasoning to estimate these probabilities.

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest that he might be inclined towards fields that involve critical thinking, problem-solving, and a connection to natural or abstract phenomena. His quiet nature and empathy suggest that he may prefer work that is less socially intensive.

Considering these points, let's evaluate:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant for computer science.
   - Enjoyment in solving puzzles translates well to coding and algorithm design.
   - His quiet nature is common in fields like computer science, where individual or small team work is prevalent.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Requires strong interaction and people management skills, which may not align well with Adam's quiet nature and preference for tasks with less social interaction.
   - While appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant, other personality traits like strong empathy and love for animals are not direct indicators of interest in this field.

Given these considerations, the qualitative assessment of likelihoods would be:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
