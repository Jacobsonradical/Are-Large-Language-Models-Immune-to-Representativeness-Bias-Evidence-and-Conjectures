To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well Adam’s personality traits align with the typical characteristics and interests associated with each field. 

Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart and empathy, a deep love for animals, and a strong understanding of hard work, we can assess each field as follows:

- **Business Administration**: This field typically requires strong leadership and communication skills, a keen interest in markets, finance, and management, and often a focus on interpersonal relationships and strategic thinking. While Adam’s intelligence and understanding of dedication could be useful here, his deep love for nature, animals, and puzzles may suggest a lesser alignment.

- **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving, abstract thinking, and working on puzzles. Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and capability to understand abstract concepts closely align with characteristics beneficial in computer science.

Based on a qualitative assessment of Adam's personality traits and their alignment with each field, we can make an informed estimation:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values represent a higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in computer science due to his love for problem-solving, abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving, whereas his inclination towards business administration is less, given the traits described. Note that these values do not add up to 1 since other fields are not considered in this limited analysis.
