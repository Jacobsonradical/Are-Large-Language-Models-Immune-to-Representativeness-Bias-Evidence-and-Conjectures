To compute the posterior conditional probability for Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration, given his personality sketch, we can apply Bayes' theorem informally by evaluating how well his characteristics match a typical profile for each field. However, without specific statistical data for prior probabilities and likelihoods, this answer will be a reasonable estimate based on the given information about Adam's traits.

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts might be more aligned with fields that involve critical thinking, problem-solving, and intellectual engagement. These traits need to be considered alongside the natural inclinations and practicality associated with each field.

Computer Science:
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators for success in computer science.
- Enjoying solving puzzles is closely related to problem-solving skills required in computer science.
- Curiosity about nature might translate into an interest in fields like bioinformatics or computational biology.
- Empathy and a warm heart, while not necessarily typical markers of computer science, don't rule it out.

Business Administration:
- Strong empathy and understanding of hard work are beneficial traits in business administration.
- A deep love for animals and a curiosity about nature don't strongly align with business administration where the focus is more on management, finance, and organizational behavior.
- High intelligence is, of course, beneficial in any field including business administration.

Based on the provided characteristics and typical profiles for each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

This estimation reflects that while Adam's traits align somewhat with both fields, they appear to be a better fit for computer science given his intellectual curiosity, love for puzzles, and abstract thinking skills. Business administration is less likely but not entirely ruled out, given his empathy and understanding of hard work.
