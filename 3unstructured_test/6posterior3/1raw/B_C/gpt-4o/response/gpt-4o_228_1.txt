To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we can qualitatively estimate these probabilities based on the alignment between his described traits and the typical traits useful or necessary in these fields.

Let's scrutinize the key traits mentioned in the personality sketch and align them with the fields:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Important Traits: Networking skills, leadership, strategic thinking, interest in economics/finance, communication skills.
   - Adam's Traits: Curious about nature and plants, quiet, loves solving puzzles, warm-hearted, strong empathy, deep love for animals, high intelligence, appreciates hard work.
   - Analysis: Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with the core traits needed in business administration. While his intelligence and appreciation for hard work could be assets, his quiet nature, empathy, and specific interest in nature and animals point more towards fields requiring analytical and observational skills rather than strategic business skills.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Important Traits: Problem-solving skills, analytical thinking, interest in technology, ability to work independently, attention to detail.
   - Adam's Traits: Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - Analysis: Adam's traits align well with the core traits for computer science. His enjoyment of solving puzzles, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are highly pertinent to a field that often requires deep analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities. While his curiosity about nature and love for animals are not directly related, they do not detract from the likelihood that he could excel in computer science.

Given the qualitative alignment of Adam's traits to the requirements of these fields, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These estimated values reflect the stronger alignment between Adam's personality traits and the field of computer science relative to business administration. Note that the probabilities do not sum to 1, as there are many other possible graduate fields he could have been enrolled in.
