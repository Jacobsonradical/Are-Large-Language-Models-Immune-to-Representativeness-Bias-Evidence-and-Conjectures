To compute the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science, we need to consider how his personality traits align with typical characteristics associated with these fields. 

Given Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Business Administration**
   - Generally, business administration students might need strong interpersonal skills, leadership qualities, and an interest in organizational behavior and economics.
   - Adam's empathy and warm heart could be advantageous in HR or management roles, but the sketch does not highlight any interest in business, management, or economics.
  
2. **Computer Science**
   - Studying computer science often requires problem-solving abilities, strong logical thinking, abstract reasoning, and sometimes a passion for technology.
   - Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, understanding of abstract concepts, and high intelligence align well with the demands of a computer science program. 

Given these considerations, it seems more likely that Adam would be enrolled in computer science than business administration. Still, he could conceivably be in either field to some extent. 

I would estimate the following probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
