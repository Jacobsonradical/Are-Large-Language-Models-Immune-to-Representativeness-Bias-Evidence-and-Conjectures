To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayesian reasoning. We infer how likely his traits are to align with typical students in those fields.

Let \( P(A_i|B) \) be the probability that Adam is in field \( A_i \) given his personality traits \( B \). Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A_i|B) = \frac{P(B|A_i) \cdot P(A_i)}{P(B)} \]

However, without specific numerical data for prior probabilities (\( P(A_i) \) for the fields and \( P(B) \) for the personality traits) and likelihoods (\( P(B|A_i) \)) for the personality profile given each field, we'll make qualitative assessments based on the typical qualities aligned with each field of study.

### Business Administration:
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Neutral relevance.
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: Slightly atypical for a typical business administration student, more analytical but generally not a defining characteristic.
- Warm heart, strong empathy: Slightly relevant for HR and managerial roles but not a core trait.
- Deep love for animals: Irrelevant.
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts: Relevant but not a primary trait for business administration.
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Important in business.

### Computer Science:
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Neutral relevance.
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: Highly relevant, common trait among computer science individuals.
- Warm heart, strong empathy: Neutral or slightly positive.
- Deep love for animals: Irrelevant.
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts: Highly relevant.
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Important in computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, it makes sense that Adamâ€™s traits align more with typical students in computer science than in business administration. 

Here are the qualitative estimations in Bayesian terms provided as approximate values:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are indicative and based on common traits and assumptions about the fields of study. Actual probabilities require detailed statistical data.
