To compute the posterior conditional probability of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning. However, given that we may not have comprehensive base rates for each field of study and other necessary probabilities, we'll provide an estimation based on the alignment of his personality traits with common attributes of professionals in these fields.

Here's an analysis based on the personality traits and typical characteristics of the fields:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles: Some relevance.
   - Warm heart and strong empathy: Moderate relevance (good for leadership roles).
   - Deep love for animals: Low relevance.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Moderate relevance.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: High relevance.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles: High relevance.
   - Warm heart and strong empathy: Some relevance (especially in team environments).
   - Deep love for animals: Low relevance.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: High relevance.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: High relevance.

Based on this alignment, Adamâ€™s personality traits seem to align somewhat with the characteristics often found in computer science students, particularly due to his enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. While some of his traits like empathy and a love for animals are not directly related to computer science, they don't detract from it significantly either. His traits like empathy and hard work also have moderately good alignment with business administration, but the strong alignment to abstract thinking and puzzles makes computer science a slightly better fit.

Given this assessment, the estimated posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either field is as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These probabilities are rough estimates and should not add up to 1 since other fields are not considered here, and they are based on the fit of personality traits typically associated with each field.
