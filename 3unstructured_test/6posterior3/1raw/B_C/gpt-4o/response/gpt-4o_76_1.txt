Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can use Bayesian inference to estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for the fields of computer science and business administration. These probabilities are influenced by how well Adam's personality traits match the typical characteristics and interests of students in each field.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam's intelligence and ability to solve puzzles align with the analytical skills often required in computer science.
   - His curiosity about nature and understanding of abstract concepts also support a suitability for this field.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - While Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business administration, the personality sketch does not highlight traits particularly aligned with business activities, such as a strong interest in commerce, management, or leadership.

Given these observations, here are the posterior conditional probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
