To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, let's analyze the traits outlined.

Adam's personality traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work suggest he may prefer fields that align with these interests. Fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology may come to mind first. However, we need to determine his likelihood of enrolling in business administration and computer science specifically.

For **business administration**:
- The field generally values leadership, strategic thinking, and interpersonal skills.
- Empathy and warm-heartedness can be advantageous for roles in management or human resources.
- However, curiosity about nature and love for animals are less directly applicable here.
  
For **computer science**:
- The field values problem-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence.
- Enjoying solving puzzles aligns well with computer science, which often involves complex problem-solving.
- Curiosity and a methodical approach to understanding systems are beneficial traits in this field.

Given these considerations, let's estimate:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These probabilities are subjective and based on aligning Adam's personality traits with the general demands and nature of the fields in question. The lower probability for business administration is due to the lack of direct alignment with Adam's traits, and the higher probability for computer science comes from his evident strengths in problem-solving and abstract thinking.
