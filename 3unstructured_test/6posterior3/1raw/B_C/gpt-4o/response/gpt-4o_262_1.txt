To compute the posterior conditional probabilities given Adam's personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' theorem. However, since we do not have explicit numerical data, we can base our estimations on qualitative reasoning about how his personality traits align with the typical characteristics required for or common in each field.

Considering Adam's personality traits:

1. Curiosity about nature and plants
2. Enjoyment in solving puzzles
3. Warm heart and strong empathy
4. Deep love for animals
5. High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts
6. Appreciation for hard work and dedication

We can analyze how these traits align with typical profiles in business administration and computer science:

**Business Administration:**
- Relies more on skills like leadership, managing people, decision-making, strategic planning, and an understanding of market and financial principles.
- While empathy and appreciation for hard work are relevant, the rest of his traits don't particularly align with the primary skills needed.

**Computer Science:**
- Requires strong problem-solving skills, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and often an enjoyment in puzzles.
- Adamâ€™s curiosity in nature and love for animals may not directly support computer science but do show a general scientific curiosity.

Based on this qualitative analysis:

{
  "business administration": 0.1, 
  "computer science": 0.6
}

These values are based on the idea that Adam's traits align more closely with those typically seen in computer science compared to business administration. The love for problem-solving, puzzles, and abstract thinking points towards computer science more robustly than towards business administration.
