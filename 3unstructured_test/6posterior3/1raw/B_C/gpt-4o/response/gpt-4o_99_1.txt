To compute the posterior conditional probability, we need to consider both Adam's personality traits and how those traits might align with the typical traits or required skills in the given fields. While I cannot provide you with exact probabilities without a detailed statistical model and empirical data, I will make educated guesses based on general knowledge and the provided personality sketch.

Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, empathy, and quiet demeanor, it seems he would be more inclined towards fields that align with these interests. While Computer Science involves problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, it doesn't directly align with his love for nature and animals. Business Administration, on the other hand, generally requires strong interpersonal and communication skills, which may not directly align with his quiet nature and deep empathy unless he is focusing on a niche like sustainable business or environmental management.

Here are my educated guesses:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are subjective estimations. They suggest that while there is a possibility that Adam could be enrolled in either of these fields, his personality traits are somewhat more aligned with Computer Science than Business Administration. However, his deep interest in nature and animals suggests he might be equally or more likely to be involved in fields such as Environmental Science, Biology, or Ecology, which are omitted here.
