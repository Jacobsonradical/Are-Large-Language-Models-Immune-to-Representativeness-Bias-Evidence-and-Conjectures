Sure, let's assess the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science, considering his personality sketch.

In Bayesian terms, we need to consider:

1. The prior probability of being enrolled in each field.
2. The likelihood of the personality traits given enrollment in each field.

### Assumptions & Reasoning:

#### Prior Probabilities:
- The prior probability (P(E)) of a graduate student enrolled in any specific field such as business administration or computer science in the U.S. can be different. For simplification, let's assume equal prior probabilities for these two fields. So, P(Business) = P(ComputerScience) is a uniform prior distribution.
  
#### Likelihoods (P(Traits | Field)):

- **Business Administration**:
  - **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Low
  - **Quiet and enjoys puzzles**: Low to Moderate
  - **Warm-hearted and empathetic**: Low to Moderate
  - **Love for animals**: Low
  - Considering all these sub-traits, the overall combined likelihood seems low.

- **Computer Science**:
  - **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Low
  - **Quiet and enjoys puzzles**: High
  - **Warm-hearted and empathetic**: Low to Moderate
  - **Love for animals**: Low
  - The likelihood increases predominantly due to "quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, and high intelligence".

### Computing Posteriors without explicit formula derivation:

Instead of creating a precise Bayesian calculation involving exact probabilities, we estimate based on comparative likelihoods:

- **Business Administration**: The traits don't highly align with a business administration profile. Let's assign this a lower likelihood score.
- **Computer Science**: Traits like enjoying puzzles and abstract thinking highly align with the computer science profile. Given this strong match, assign a higher likelihood score.

Based on this qualitative analysis:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.8
}
```

These values indicate it is more likely that Adam, given his personality traits, was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration in 2021.
