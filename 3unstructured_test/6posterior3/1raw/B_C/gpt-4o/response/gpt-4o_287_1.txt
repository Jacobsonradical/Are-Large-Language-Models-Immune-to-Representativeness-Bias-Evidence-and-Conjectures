To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in specific fields given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. However, given the nature of this problem, we will have to make subjective estimates based on the information provided because we lack the precise data to apply Bayes' Theorem mathematically.

Given Adam's personality traits:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's make some subjective estimates:

- **Business Administration**: Typically, this field requires strong skills in leadership, management, and a good understanding of business principles. Adam's traits show strong empathy and appreciation for hard work but don't emphasize skills directly correlated with business and management. Thus, the probability might be lower.

- **Computer Science**: This field often requires a high level of intelligence, problem-solving skills, and the ability to understand abstract concepts. Adam excels in these areas with his love for puzzles and strong grasp of abstract concepts. Therefore, the probability might be higher.

Based on these considerations, let's provide our subjective estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values indicate that, given the personality traits provided, it is subjectively more likely that Adam was enrolled in a computer science program rather than a business administration program in 2021.
