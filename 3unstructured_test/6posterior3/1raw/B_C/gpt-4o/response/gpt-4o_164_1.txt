To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we apply Bayes' theorem, which is \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \). Here, \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of being in a given field given Adam's personality sketch.

- \( P(B|A) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality given the field.
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability of being in the field.
- \( P(B) \): Total probability of observing Adam's personality.

Since we lack explicit base rates for these fields and exact numerical likelihoods, we'll make some reasoned estimates based on the information given.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Typically involves interpersonal skills, leadership qualities, and a focus on business and economics rather than nature or animals.
   - Given Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work, there's some fit, but his interests don't align heavily with typical business students.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Strong fit with intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving skills.
   - However, thereâ€™s less emphasis in the sketch on technology or coding specifically.

Taking these factors into account and normalizing:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
