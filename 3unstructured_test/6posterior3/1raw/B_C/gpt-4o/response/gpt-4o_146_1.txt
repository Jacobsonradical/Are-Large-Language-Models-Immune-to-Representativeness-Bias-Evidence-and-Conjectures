To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to utilize Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Adam is in a specific field (e.g., business administration or computer science).
- \( B \) is the event that Adam has the given personality sketch.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam is in the field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in the field.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of the field.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

The likelihood \( P(B|A) \) should be influenced by how characteristic the personality sketch is for students in each of the given fields.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions based on the typical characteristics often found among students in business administration and computer science, considering Adam's personality traits:

For business administration:
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Moderate relevance
- Warm heart and empathy: Some relevance
- Deep love for animals: Low relevance
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Some relevance
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: High relevance

For computer science:
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance
- Enjoys solving puzzles: High relevance
- Warm heart and empathy: Low to moderate relevance
- Deep love for animals: Low relevance
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: High relevance
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: High relevance

Given these qualitative assessments, we can quantify our likelihoods:

For business administration (BA):
\[ P(B|BA) = 0.1 \times 0.5 \times 0.2 \times 0.1 \times 0.3 \times 0.7 \approx 0.0021 \]

For computer science (CS):
\[ P(B|CS) = 0.1 \times 0.9 \times 0.2 \times 0.1 \times 0.8 \times 0.7 \approx 0.0101 \]

Next, we need to determine the prior probabilities \( P(A) \). Let's assume:
\[ P(BA) = 0.2 \] (20%, reflecting a general, moderate interest in this field among graduates)
\[ P(CS) = 0.3 \] (30%, due to the high demand and interest)

Now, \( P(B) \) is essentially a normalizing constant, summing across fields. But since we are dealing with only two fields here and normalizing is unnecessary in presenting conditional probabilities, we use the above priors directly.

Now we need the posterior probabilities:

For business administration:
\[ P(BA|B) = \frac{P(B|BA) \cdot P(BA)}{P(B)} \]
Ignoring the denominator for comparison, we get:
\[ P(BA|B) \propto P(B|BA) \cdot P(BA) = 0.0021 \times 0.2 = 0.00042 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
Ignoring the denominator for comparison, we get:
\[ P(CS|B) \propto P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) = 0.0101 \times 0.3 = 0.00303 \]

Since we're ignoring the common denominator and just focusing on comparative results:

\[ P(BA) \approx 0.00042 / (0.00042 + 0.00303) \approx 0.12 \]
\[ P(CS) \approx 0.00303 / (0.00042 + 0.00303) \approx 0.88 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are approximately:

\[ \{
  "business administration": 0.12,
  "computer science": 0.88
\} \]

These values indicate a much higher likelihood that Adam is in computer science compared to business administration given his personality sketch.
