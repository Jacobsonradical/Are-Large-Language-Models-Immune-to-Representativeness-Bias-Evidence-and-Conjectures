To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we must consider the characteristics described and how they align with the typical profiles for these fields. We typically utilize Bayesâ€™ Theorem for such calculations, but given the absence of specific base rate data and likelihoods, we rely on qualitative assessment.

Here is the analysis based on the given personality traits:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - High intelligence can apply to any field.
   - Warm heart and strong empathy are not typically highlighted as central traits for business administration.
   - Deep love for animals and nature, as well as strong appreciation for dedication, are less aligned with business activities.
   - Curiosity about nature and interest in solving puzzles are not primary characteristics of typical business students.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are strong fits for computer science.
   - Enjoyment in solving puzzles aligns well with problem-solving aspects in computer science.
   - While empathy and love for animals are less field-specific, they do not preclude a fit for computer science.
   - Given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of fields, appreciation for hard work fits well with computer science.

Given these insights, we assign the following probability estimates qualitatively:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These estimates reflect that Adam's interests and characteristics are more closely aligned with computer science than business administration. The values do not sum to 1 because we must account for the possibility that Adam could be enrolled in other fields not analyzed here.
