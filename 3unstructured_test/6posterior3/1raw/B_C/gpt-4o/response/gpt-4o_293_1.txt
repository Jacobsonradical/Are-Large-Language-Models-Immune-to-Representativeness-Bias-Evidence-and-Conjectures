To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we'll use Bayes' Theorem in a qualitative rather than quantitative manner, as we don't have the exact prior probabilities or likelihood functions. Here's a qualitative analysis based on Adam's personality traits:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these traits, let's analyze the fit for each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
    - While empathy and an appreciation for hard work can be relevant here, many of the other traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, interest in puzzles) don't strongly align with what is typically required or valued in business administration.
   
2. **Computer Science:**
    - Enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and a good understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. Curiosity, though more nature-oriented for Adam, is also a beneficial trait in this field. The hard work and dedication also fit well here.

Based on this qualitative analysis, we can suppose that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.

The posterior conditional probabilities might look something like this:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This suggests Adam is quite likely to be in computer science, given his personality traits, but much less likely to be in business administration.
