To determine the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the specified fields given his personality sketch, I am assuming that the likelihood of enrolling in different fields can be inferred from the match between Adam's traits and typical traits of students in those fields. However, it's important to note that without specific prior probabilities or a more detailed statistical model, any calculated probabilities are subjective estimates rather than formally derived results.

Given his personality sketch, let's consider how his traits match the typical characteristics of students in each field:

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns well with problem-solving skills needed in computer science.
   - Quiet nature might suggest a preference for individual or analytical work.
   - However, the field doesn't specifically align with his love for nature and animals, though it doesn't contradict it either.

2. **Business Administration**: 
   - High intelligence and appreciation for hard work might align with the strategic and operational aspects of business administration.
   - Strong empathy and warm heart could be beneficial for leadership and team management.
   - However, this field does not particularly match his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals.

Based on this subjective analysis:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These values are indicative and based on the relative alignment of Adam's personality traits with each field. Adjustments could be made with more specific prior information about graduate student distributions and typical characteristics in each field.
