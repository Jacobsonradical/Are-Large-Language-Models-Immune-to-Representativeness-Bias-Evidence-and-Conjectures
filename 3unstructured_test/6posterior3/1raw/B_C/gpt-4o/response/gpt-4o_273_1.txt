To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, given the sketch's nature, we will have to rely on intuitive matching between Adam's personality traits and the typical characteristics associated with different fields. 

Here are a few considerations that could affect your judgment:

1. **Computer Science**: This field often appeals to individuals who are intelligent and enjoy solving puzzles. Moreover, those who have an appreciation for abstract concepts may find computer science (which includes such areas as algorithms and theoretical computing) intriguing.

2. **Business Administration**: This field often appeals to individuals with strong interpersonal skills, a knack for understanding human behavior in organizational contexts, and an appreciation for management and leadership. The emphasis here is more often on practical and socio-economic concepts rather than abstract problem-solving.

Given the traits described in Adam's sketch, he doesnâ€™t display a strong orientation towards business functions like leadership or organizational behavior but has a clear affinity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, making computer science a more likely field for him.

Taking these considerations into account, here is the subjective estimation:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

These probabilities are subjective and based on qualitative assessments of how well Adam's personality aligns with the typical characteristics of these fields.
