To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we need to consider how likely someone with his traits would be in each of those fields. This involves using Bayes' Theorem, which in practice is often approached through qualitative reasoning when detailed prior probabilities and likelihoods are unavailable. Based on Adam's personality traits, we can make qualitative assessments for each field.

Given:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He is a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Let's consider each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Generally, this field would be better suited for someone who enjoys management, leadership, networking, and possibly a more social or client-facing role.
   - It may not align as well with qualities such as a deep love for nature and animals, a preference for quiet, introspective activities like solving puzzles, and a focus on empathy.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - This field aligns well with someone who enjoys solving puzzles and dealing with abstract concepts.
   - High intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts are crucial in computer science.
   - This field may also align well with someone who enjoys introspective work over highly social tasks.

Given these qualitative alignments, Adam seems more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration. Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Note: These values are qualitative estimates based on the provided personality sketch and common characteristics required in each field.
