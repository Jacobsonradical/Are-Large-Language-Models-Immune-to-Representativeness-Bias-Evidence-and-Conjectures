To compute the posterior conditional probability, we need to consider how well Adam's personality and interests align with the typical profiles of students in the mentioned fields. Here, we will provide a qualitative assessment based on the description given.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Business administration programs tend to attract individuals who are outgoing, strong in leadership, interested in management, organizational dynamics, and often have a more people-focused approach.
   - Adam is described as a quiet boy with a passion for nature, plants, animals, and puzzles. These traits are not strongly indicative of a typical business administration student.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Computer science programs often attract individuals who have strong analytical skills, enjoy solving complex problems, and have high intelligence, particularly in abstract concepts.
   - Adamâ€™s described strengths (high intelligence, puzzle-solving, appreciation for hard work, and understanding abstract concepts) align well with the characteristics of a computer science student.

Given these considerations, we can estimate the likelihood as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's personality and interests are more aligned with those typical of a computer science graduate student than those of a business administration student.
