To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science, we can use Bayesian reasoning. Given Adam's personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits align with each field of study.

**Field of Business Administration:**
- Often emphasizes leadership, strategy, marketing, economics, and financial acumen.
- Typical traits might include strategic thinking, strong interpersonal skills, and an interest in business operations and efficiency.

Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles (analytic skillset)
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

**Field of Computer Science:**
- Involves programming, problem-solving, algorithms, software development, and theoretical concepts.
- Typical traits include strong analytical and problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and abstract thinking.

Adam's traits:
- Enjoys solving puzzles (strong indicator for CS due to problem-solving nature)
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts (fits well with CS requirements)
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants (less relevant, neutral)
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals (neutral or weakly relevant, but doesn't detract significantly)
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication (beneficial for any demanding field)

Given these analyses, Adam's traits are somewhat neutral for business administration but strongly indicative of a fit for computer science, particularly due to his problem-solving abilities and understanding of abstract concepts.

Here's the posterior conditional probability estimation:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are based on the alignment of Adam's traits with typical characteristics of students in each field. The remaining probability would account for other possible fields of study that might also align with his personality and interests.
