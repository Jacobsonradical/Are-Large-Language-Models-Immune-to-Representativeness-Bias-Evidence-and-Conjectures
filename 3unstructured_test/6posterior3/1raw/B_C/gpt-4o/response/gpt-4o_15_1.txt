To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we'll need to apply Bayes' theorem. This takes into account the prior probability of enrollment in each field and the likelihood of the personality traits given enrollment in each field.

However, in the absence of specific prior probabilities and likelihood data, we can qualitatively assess how well his personality traits match each field.

Given his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, Adam's traits are favorable for computer science. His empathy and warm heart might be less directly related, but his problem-solving skills are a strong fit here.

For business administration, while a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication align, Adam's traits of empathy and love for animals might be less directly applicable. Also, the personality description doesn't emphasize traits like leadership or strong interpersonal communication, which are often important in business administration.

Based on these qualitative assessments, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are subjective estimates based on the described traits and typical requirements of the two fields. For a more precise answer, we'd need specific data on enrollment probabilities and personality trait distributions within each field.
