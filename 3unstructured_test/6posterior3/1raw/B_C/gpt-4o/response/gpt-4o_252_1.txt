To compute the posterior conditional probability for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning. However, since we don't have the prior probabilities or specific statistical data, we'll make a qualitative estimation based on Adam's profile.

Adam's profile is characterized by curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, empathy, and appreciation of hard work. These traits align more closely with certain fields than others.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Pros: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and he is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant in computer science.
   - Cons: His strong curiosity about nature and deep love for animals are less aligned with typical computer science interests, which are more technology-centric.
   
   Therefore, the probability here might be moderate.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Pros: Appreciation for hard work and dedication are important in business administration. 
   - Cons: This field doesn't strongly align with his love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles.
   
   Therefore, the probability for business administration might be lower.

Given these qualitative assessments, the estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
Note: These values are subjective and based on qualitative reasoning rather than exact statistical data.
