To compute the posterior conditional probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of Adam being in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing his personality traits given he is in a particular field.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing his personality traits across all fields.

Given that specific numerical values for \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) are not provided, we will make qualitative assessments based on typical personality traits of students in these fields and make some reasonable assumptions. 

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts align well with the typical skill set of computer science students.
   - Enjoying solving puzzles is a common trait among those in computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - A warm heart and strong empathy can be useful but are less critical traits for business administration.
   - A deep love for animals and curiosity about nature are not strongly aligned with business administration but could align with corporate social responsibility aspects.

Given these considerations, we qualitatively estimate the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are based on the assumption that Adam's traits are more common and critical for success in computer science than in business administration.
