To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider both the likelihood of his personality traits being a fit for these fields and the prior probabilities of enrollment in these fields.

Let's denote:
- \(P(E|C)\): Probability of Adam being in computer science given his personality traits.
- \(P(E|B)\): Probability of Adam being in business administration given his personality traits.
- \(P(C)\): Prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science.
- \(P(B)\): Prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration.
- \(P(E)\): Overall probability of Adam having these personality traits.

Given Adam's traits:
- High intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and puzzle-solving are well matched to computer science.
- Warm heart, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work can be a fit for multiple fields, including business administration but are not uniquely identifying.

These traits (love for nature, animals, empathy) are less stereotypically associated with business administration.

Without concrete prior probabilities, we'll use a simplified Bayesian approach assuming equal priors for general populations in graduate fields unless otherwise specified.

Assume:
- \(P(C) \approx 0.25 \): Roughly balanced distribution among various graduate fields, computer science being a common choice.
- \(P(B) \approx 0.25 \): Same assumption for business administration.
- These priors might vary in real scenarios but this assumption helps in analyzing based solely on personality.

Next, consider the likelihoods:
- \(P(E|C)\): High given his intelligence, abstract thinking, and love for puzzles (~0.7).
- \(P(E|B)\): Lower given business administration is less stereotypically associated with these specific traits (~0.2).

To compute posterior probabilities:
- \(P(C|E) \propto P(E|C) * P(C)\)
- \(P(B|E) \propto P(E|B) * P(B)\)

Normalization is not required here as we're only comparing the two.

\(P(C|E) \propto 0.7 * 0.25 = 0.175\)

\(P(B|E) \propto 0.2 * 0.25 = 0.05\)

Taking the ratios:

\(
P(C|E) = \frac{0.175}{0.175 + 0.05}  \approx 0.777
\)
\(
P(B|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.175 + 0.05} \approx 0.223
\)

Thus:
