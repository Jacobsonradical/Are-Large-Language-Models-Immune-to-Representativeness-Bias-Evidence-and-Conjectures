To compute the posterior probabilities, we would typically use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem combines prior probabilities with the likelihood of the observed data given each hypothesis. However, we don't have the actual prior probabilities or detailed likelihoods, so we will make a reasoned estimation based on the provided personality sketch.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, he seems less aligned with traditionally competitive and profit-driven fields such as business administration. His high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align more closely with fields that are intellectually stimulating and require problem-solving skills, which fits well with computer science.

### Estimate of Posterior Probabilities

**Computer Science**:
1. Curiosity about nature and abstract concepts can align with interests in artificial intelligence, simulation, and computational biology.
2. Solving puzzles is a common trait among those who enjoy coding and algorithm challenges.
3. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are important in computer science.

**Business Administration**:
1. Empathy and warm heart are useful for leadership but not exclusive.
2. Love for animals and curiosity for nature are less directly relevant to business principles.

Here is the estimated posterior conditional probabilities for Adam being enrolled in the respective fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

These probabilities are not absolute and are based on a qualitative assessment of the fit between Adam's personality and the typical attributes required in each field. In the absence of detailed prior probabilities and likelihoods, these serve as reasoned estimates.
