To provide a posterior conditional probability for Adam being enrolled in computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider which traits align closely with typical characteristics of students in these fields. Given Adam's interests and characteristics, we can leverage some general insights about the kinds of students who usually enroll in these fields. This approach, however, will be based on intuition and known correlations rather than precise statistical analysis, as that kind of data isn't provided.

**Personality Traits of Adam:**
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence
- Good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

### Computer Science:
- Typically appeals to individuals who enjoy problem-solving, abstract thinking, and analytical work.
- High intelligence and an affinity for puzzles fit well with the rigorous logical and theoretical foundations of computer science.
- However, Adam's deep love for nature and animals might not be as directly aligned with the typical focus areas in computer science (though not entirely mutually exclusive, especially considering areas like computational biology).

### Business Administration:
- Often attracts individuals who are interested in leadership, management, and organizational behavior.
- Requires strong people skills and empathy, which Adam has.
- Business courses can indeed value high intelligence and a capacity for strategic thinking, although Adam's quiet demeanor might not align perfectly with the often interpersonal, extroverted aspects of business administration.

Given these considerations, we can infer the following probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Here, the higher probability for computer science is due to Adam's problem-solving skills, affinity for abstract thinking, and intelligence, although his love for nature and animals might lean him towards biological sciences or environmental studies, which aren't covered in this specific question. Business Administration, being less aligned with his quiet and puzzle-solving nature, gets a lower probability.
