To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider the alignment between Adam's personality traits and the typical requirements or common traits associated with students in those fields. This process involves subjective judgment, and without specific prior probabilities or a detailed study, we can only give an educated estimation.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Personality traits such as genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and a love for animals do not strongly align with business administration.
   - The appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant, but overall, business administration might not be the best fit given his traits.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are highly relevant.
   - Enjoyment in solving puzzles aligns well with the problem-solving nature of computer science.
   - Although a love for nature and animals isnâ€™t specifically relevant, it doesn't detract significantly.
  
Given these considerations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.8
}
```
These values are subjective and based on the typical correlation between Adam's traits and the commonly observed traits in these fields.
