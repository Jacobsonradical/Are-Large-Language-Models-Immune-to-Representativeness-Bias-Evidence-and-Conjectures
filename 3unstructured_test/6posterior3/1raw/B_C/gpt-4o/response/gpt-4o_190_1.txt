To compute the posterior conditional probability, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch. Let's consider that Adam's personality traits (such as a genuine curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, a warm heart, strong empathy, a deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work) are generally more aligned with certain fields.

Given his curiosity about nature and love for animals, Adam's traits seem more aligned with fields that are more focused on natural sciences or biology rather than business administration. Additionally, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence with abstract concepts might be more indicative of computer science than business administration.

Given these considerations, we can a priori assume that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration. We will assign higher posterior probabilities to computer science and lower to business administration reflecting this reasoning.

Here's an estimated posterior conditional probability for each field based on the given personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are not derived from precise empirical data but are rather estimations based on the alignment of his personality traits with the typical skillsets and interests associated with each field.
