To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. However, without precise priors or likelihoods, we will base our probabilities on qualitative reasoning.

1. **Computer Science**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts. These traits are often associated with success in computer science.
   - His curiosity about nature and plants and his love for animals, while more aligned with biological sciences, do not specifically contradict an interest in computer science.

2. **Business Administration**
   - Adam's strong empathy and warm heart may be beneficial in business administration, particularly in areas like human resources or organizational behavior.
   - However, his interests in nature, animals, and puzzles seem less aligned with typical business administration focuses unless he is pursuing a niche field like environmental management or a business focusing on ecological products.

Based on this qualitative reasoning, I would assign the following posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's personality traits and interests are somewhat more aligned with computer science than business administration, although either field is plausible.
