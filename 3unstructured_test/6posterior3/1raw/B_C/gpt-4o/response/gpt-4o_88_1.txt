To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how likely Adam's personality traits are given each field of study. This involves making some subjective judgments about how well his characteristics match typical students in each field.

Adam's traits include:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

Given these traits:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence are strong indicators for computer science, as this field often involves problem-solving and conceptual thinking.
   - While curiosity about nature is less directly aligned, it’s possible as computer science students may have wide-ranging interests.
   - Empathy and a deep love for animals are less characteristic of computer science students specifically but don't preclude it.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication is a good fit for business administration.
   - Empathy is valuable in business, especially in leadership and team management.
   - Enjoyment of puzzles is less directly relevant, although strategic thinking could align.
   - Curiosity about nature and deep love for animals are less directly connected to the business administration field.

Now, roughly assuming the alignment of characteristics with the fields, we might estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These are subjective estimates based on the personality traits given. Note that these estimates are not derived from empirical data but rather from a reasoned assessment of how well Adam’s traits match each field.
