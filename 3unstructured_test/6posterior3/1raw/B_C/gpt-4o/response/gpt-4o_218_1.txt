To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we'll need to use Bayesian reasoning. Since we do not have actual statistical data, we will use a qualitative approach based on the likelihood that someone with Adam's attributes would be in each field.

Firstly, let's consider the aspects of Adam's personality that might be relevant to each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators for this field.
   - Enjoying solving puzzles is also highly relevant; it aligns well with problem-solving and analytical thinking required in computer science.
   - Curiosity about nature might align with scientific thinking, although not directly indicative of computer science specifically.
   
2. **Business Administration:**
   - A deep love for animals and empathy might align more with a management approach that involves social interaction, but they are not primary indicators.
   - High intelligence is relevant, but business administration often requires skills and interests in areas like people management, finance, and communication, which were not highlighted in the personality sketch.

Given these points, we would qualitatively assess the probabilities as follows (note these are qualitative assessments and not derived from actual statistical calculations):

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

This reflects a higher likelihood for computer science based on his problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, and curiosity, compared to business administration where his personality traits align less directly with typical requirements of the field.
