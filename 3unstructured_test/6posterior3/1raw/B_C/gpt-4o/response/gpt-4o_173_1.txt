To compute the posterior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration, we'll need to consider the likelihood of his personality traits fitting those fields and any prior probabilities if they were available. Since prior probabilities are not provided, we'll base our estimates solely on the compatibility of his personality sketch with each field.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam exhibits high intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are traits commonly aligned with computer science.
   - His curiosity about nature and enjoyment of solving puzzles indicate strong analytical skills, further supporting the likelihood of him being in this field.
   Using this qualitative assessment, we'll assign a higher probability to computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam's empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work are positive traits in business administration, especially in roles that involve managing teams or interpersonal interactions.
   - However, his deep love for animals, strong curiosity about nature and plants, and quiet disposition might be less indicative of a typical business administration student.
   Therefore, while it is possible for someone with his traits to be in business administration, we estimate a lower probability relative to computer science.

Given these considerations, the estimated posterior conditional probabilities are as follows:

```
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.35
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's personality traits more closely align with a field like computer science, while acknowledging that business administration remains a plausible, though less likely, option.
