To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we would base our reasoning on how well Adam's personality traits match the typical traits expected in those fields. However, without specific data on trait distributions per field, we'll use a reasoned qualitative assessment for this task. 

Adam's traits include curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. Let’s break down how each field might align with these traits:

1. **Business Administration**
   - Business administration often involves people management, decision-making under uncertainty, and sometimes strategic planning. Empathy and a warm heart can be beneficial in leadership roles.
   - Strong intelligence and understanding might help in strategic planning and problem-solving.
   - However, a genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals is not typically aligned with business administration.

Given these points, the match is not particularly strong.
   
2. **Computer Science**
   - Computer science involves significant problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, which aligns very well with Adam’s traits of high intelligence and enjoyment in solving puzzles.
   - Curiosity about nature may not be directly related but could align with fields like bioinformatics or environmental modeling within computer science.
   - Strong empathy and a warm heart are less traditionally associated with computer science but can still be beneficial in collaborative environments.
   - A love for animals might indirectly contribute through specialized fields like AI for animal behavior studies or conservation efforts.

Given these points, the match is fairly strong.

Based on this reasoning, we can approximate the probabilities qualitatively:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

This suggests that it is more likely Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality traits, but there remains a non-zero possibility he was in business administration, especially considering the importance of empathy and intelligence in leadership.
