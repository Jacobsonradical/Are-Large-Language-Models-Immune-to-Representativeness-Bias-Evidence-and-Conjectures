Based on the personality sketch of Adam, we'll compute the posterior probabilities for the fields of business administration and computer science given the provided characteristics.

Adam's attributes:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Let's consider these attributes in relation to the fields of business administration and computer science:

**Business Administration:**
- While intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts can be beneficial in business administration, Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest a more scientific or humanitarian inclination.
- Moreover, the traits of enjoying solving puzzles and a deep empathy might not be strongly indicative of business administration, which often emphasizes strategic, financial, and managerial skills.

**Computer Science:**
- High intelligence, enjoying solving puzzles, and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science, which requires a logical mind and problem-solving abilities.
- Strong empathy and a love for animals are not typical features that would direct one towards or away from computer science specifically, but they do not conflict with the field either.
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants may not directly relate to computer science, but it suggests a scientific or analytical mindset, which is complementary.

Given these considerations, the posterior conditional probabilities might look something like this:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's personality sketch, with his skills and interests, is more indicative of computer science than business administration, although it's not impossible for him to be interested in business administration, albeit less likely.
