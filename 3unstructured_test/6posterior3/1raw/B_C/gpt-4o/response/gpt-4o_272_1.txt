To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality traits align with the typical traits and interests of students in business administration and computer science. We can use Bayesian reasoning to make an educated guess.

Firstly, let's break down Adam's characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

Now let's analyze how these characteristics align with each field.

### Business Administration
Traits that might align:
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts can be beneficial.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work are important in business.

Traits that might not align:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and deep love for animals might not be directly related.
- Strong empathy is valuable but not unique to business administration.
- Enjoying puzzles is less directly related.

### Computer Science
Traits that might align:
- Enjoys solving puzzles is highly indicative of a fit for computer science.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are crucial.
- Genuine curiosity about various fields can be beneficial.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is significant.

Traits that might not align:
- Warm heart and strong empathy are good traits but might not be directly related to computer science.
- Deep love for animals might not directly indicate computer science interests.

Given these considerations, it appears that Adam's personality sketch aligns more closely with a profile suitable for computer science than business administration. However, both fields value high intelligence, abstract thinking, and hard work, so there is some probability he could be in either.

Using Bayesian inference subjectively:

{
  "business administration": 0.2, 
  "computer science": 0.6
}

These values indicate a higher likelihood that Adam's characteristics fit the computer science field, but there is still some probability he could be in business administration. Additionally, note that these are subjective guesses based on the given information and could vary with more data.
