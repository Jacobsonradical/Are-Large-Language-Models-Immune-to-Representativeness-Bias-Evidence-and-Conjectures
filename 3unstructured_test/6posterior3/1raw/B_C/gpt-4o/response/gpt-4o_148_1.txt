To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities, it's important to consider the likelihood of Adam's personality traits and interests aligning with each academic field. Given the personality sketch and the relevant characteristics for each field, let's analyze and compute the probabilities accordingly:

1. **Business Administration**
   - Business administration typically involves leadership skills, strategic thinking, and a strong focus on interpersonal and communication skills.
   - Adam's warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work could be advantageous in business; however, there's no notable mention of skills or interests particularly aligned with business administration.

2. **Computer Science**
   - Computer science often requires abstract thinking, problem-solving, and a strong understanding of technical concepts.
   - Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align more closely with the nature of computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants doesn't directly imply an interest in technology, but his problem-solving skills are a significant indicator.

Based on this analysis, it seems more likely that Adam's skills and interests align with computer science over business administration. Given this, we can estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Given that these values do not need to total 1 and considering there are other fields Adam might have been involved in, this estimation suggests a stronger likelihood of Adam being enrolled in computer science compared to business administration.
