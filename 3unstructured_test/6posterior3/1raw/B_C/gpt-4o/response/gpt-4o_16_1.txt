To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, let's consider the traits and how they might align with each field:

1. **Curiosity about Nature and Plants**: This trait doesn't strongly align with either computer science or business administration but may indirectly suggest a preference for natural sciences.
2. **Quiet**: This could slightly favor computer science, where solitary work and concentration are often beneficial.
3. **Enjoys Solving Puzzles**: This trait is more aligned with fields like computer science, where problem-solving skills are crucial.
4. **Warm Heart and Strong Empathy**: These traits might be seen more frequently in fields such as social sciences or healthcare, but they aren't exclusive.
5. **Love for Animals**: This suggests a potential interest in fields related to biology or veterinary sciences.
6. **High Intelligence and Understanding of Abstract Concepts**: This is a strong indicator for computer science, where abstract thinking is essential.
7. **Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication**: This trait is generic and applicable to both fields.

Given these considerations, here's a plausible estimation:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

### Justification:
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Adam’s enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and capacity for abstract thought make a stronger case for computer science, although his love for nature and animals slightly detracts from the likelihood as this is not typically associated with computer science.
- **Business Administration (0.05)**: The traits described do not strongly align with business administration, which often values leadership, networking, and strategic thinking—all of which are not highlighted in Adam’s personality sketch.

Again, these probabilities do not sum to one, as there are many other fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology that may better match his attributes.
