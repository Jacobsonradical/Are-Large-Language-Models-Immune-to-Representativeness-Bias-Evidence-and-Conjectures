To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits match the typical profile of students in each field. Given that we don't have exact statistics, we'll need to rely on educated guesses based on the provided details and general knowledge.

Let's summarize the key traits relevant to Adam's enrollment:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants** – More aligned with fields like Biology, Environmental Science, or similar.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles** – Strong fit for Computer Science and possibly for fields that require analytical thinking.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals** – Could indicate fields like Veterinary Science, Psychology, or perhaps non-specific towards the given fields.
4. **High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts** – Fits well with advanced fields such as Computer Science.
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication** – Valuable in any field, though business might emphasize dedication in the context of leadership and management roles.

Considering these details, we can make some reasonable assumptions:

- **Computer Science:** Adam's high intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and abstract thinking are very well-suited for computer science. While his empathy and love for animals are not directly related, they don't strongly detract from this field either.

- **Business Administration:** Adam’s strong empathy and understanding of hard work could be beneficial in areas like human resources or organizational behavior within business administration. However, his love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles seems less directly related to traditional business disciplines focused on finance, marketing, etc.

Based on these considerations, we can estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's profile aligns more strongly with Computer Science due to his analytical and abstract thinking skills, while his empathy and appreciation for dedication also give him some suitability for Business Administration, albeit to a lesser extent.
