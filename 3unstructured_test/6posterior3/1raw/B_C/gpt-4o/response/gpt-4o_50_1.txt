In Bayesian probability, to compute posterior conditional probabilities, we would typically need prior probabilities for each field along with the likelihood of the given personality sketch for those fields. However, in the absence of concrete priors and likelihoods, we can make a reasoned estimate based on the provided personality characteristics and general knowledge.

Given Adam's strong appreciation for nature, empathy, intelligence in abstract concepts, and love for animals, it seems more likely that these traits align less with a business administration program and possibly more with fields related to natural sciences and computational fields where problem-solving and abstract reasoning are key.

Here's a reasoned estimated attempt:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,  // This value is lower because the personality traits mentioned do not strongly align with what is typically required or sought after in business administration.
  "computer science": 0.6  // This value is higher because computer science often involves problem-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts.
}

Note that the values provided are based on reasonable estimations rather than formal statistical calculations due to the lack of specific numerical data.
