To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration, given the personality sketch, we need to carry out a Bayesian analysis. This involves the prior probabilities of enrolling in each field and the likelihood of observing the given personality traits for each field. However, without specific numerical data for prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can provide a qualitative estimate based on the provided information.

First, let's summarize the key aspects of Adam's personality relevant to the fields:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles (high logical and analytical skill)
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication 

### Analysis:

**Computer Science:**
- Analytical and logical skills (enjoys solving puzzles): Highly relevant.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: Highly relevant.
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Less relevant, but his methodical approach can be beneficial.
- Empathy and love for animals: Not directly relevant to the field, but could influence human-computer interaction or AI ethics.

**Business Administration:**
- Empathy and interpersonal skills: Highly relevant for leadership and management roles.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Highly relevant.
- High intelligence: Relevant.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Relevant in strategic decision-making.
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Less relevant.

### Posterior Conditional Probability Estimate:

Based on the above analysis, Adam's personality traits align more closely with those required and typical in computer science due to his strong logical, analytical, and abstract thinking skills. While his empathy and interpersonal skills are highly relevant for business administration, his overall profile suggests a higher likelihood towards computer science.

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These values are subjective and are based on the qualitative assessment of how the provided traits align with the typical demands and attributes of the fields in question.
