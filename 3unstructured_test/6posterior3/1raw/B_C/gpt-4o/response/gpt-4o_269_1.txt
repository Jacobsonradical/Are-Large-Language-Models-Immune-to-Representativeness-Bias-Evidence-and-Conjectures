To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' theorem. In the absence of precise numerical data, we can use qualitative reasoning based on the match between Adam's traits and the typical characteristics of students in each field. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Traits associated with business administration**:
   - Business administration students often have strong interpersonal and communication skills.
   - They may be extroverted, with a strong interest in leadership and management.
   - A typical business administration student may not necessarily have a deep curiosity about nature or a strong love for animals, though this is not impossible.

2. **Traits associated with computer science**:
   - Computer science students often have strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
   - They may have a keen interest in abstract concepts and logical thinking.
   - A typical computer science student may enjoy puzzles and have a quiet disposition.

Considering Adam's personality sketch:
- Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals points more towards fields related to the natural sciences rather than strictly business or computer science.
- His enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science.
- However, his warm heart and empathy might not be a strong match for the stereotype of a business administration student.

With these qualitative assessments in mind, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These values indicate that given Adam's personality sketch, there is a low probability that he was enrolled in a business administration program and a higher but not certain probability that he was enrolled in a computer science program.
