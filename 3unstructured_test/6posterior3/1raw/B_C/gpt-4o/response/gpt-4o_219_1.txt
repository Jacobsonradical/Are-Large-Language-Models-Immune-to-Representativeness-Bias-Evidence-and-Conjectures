To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we need to evaluate how well Adam’s characteristics align with typical attributes and interests associated with each of these fields. Given the information:

1. Business Administration:
   - Qualities like genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy are not typically aligned with business administration.
   - A strong understanding and appreciation for hard work can be a good fit, as this is a key trait in business.
   - Generally, business administration may not strongly correlate with Adam’s interests and personality traits.

2. Computer Science:
   - High intelligence and being good at understanding abstract concepts align closely with computer science.
   - Enjoying solving puzzles is a significant indicator towards computer science, which often involves problem-solving.
   - Computer science can also align with quieter, introspective personalities who enjoy working with logical structures and algorithms.

Considering these interpretations of Adam’s characteristics, it seems more likely for Adam to have been enrolled in computer science than in business administration.

Here is the computed posterior conditional probability:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values represent informed but subjective estimates based on the given personality traits and common characteristics of graduate students in these fields. Other fields of study could also have high probabilities, but these have not been considered here.
