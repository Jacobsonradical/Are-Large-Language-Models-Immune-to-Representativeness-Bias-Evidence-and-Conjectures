To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to rely on Bayes' theorem, which involves both the prior probabilities of Adam being in specific fields and the likelihood of observing his personality characteristics given those fields. Since we donâ€™t have specific data or priors for all graduate students, let's make some educated guesses based on typical traits associated with each field.

Given:
1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. He is quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a love for animals.
3. He is highly intelligent and understands abstract concepts.
4. He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Let's consider the likelihood of these traits fitting into the given fields:

**Business Administration:**
- Strong empathy and appreciation for hard work can align with leadership and management roles.
- However, curiosity about nature and a focus on animals are less typical in this field.

**Computer Science:**
- Enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators for this field.
- High intelligence is also a good fit.
- Empathy and love for animals are less directly relevant but not contradictory.

Given the above considerations, we might infer:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This distribution reflects the more direct alignment of Adam's traits with fields that emphasize problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence such as computer science, versus business administration where empathy and hard work are relevant but nature-related curiosity is less typical. These values are educated guesses in the absence of specific data.
