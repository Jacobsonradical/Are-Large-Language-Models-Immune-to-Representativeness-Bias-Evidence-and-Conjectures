To compute the posterior conditional probability, we use Bayesian inference, which in this context generally requires prior probabilities (the likelihood of being in each field before considering personality traits), and the likelihood of the personality traits given each field. In the absence of specific numerical priors and likelihoods, this will be a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch and the typical characteristics valued in each field of study.

Business Administration:
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Not particularly relevant to business
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: Not typical but not exclusive
- Warm-hearted, empathetic: Valuable in leadership and management, but not a primary trait
- High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: Beneficial for strategy and high-level decision making
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Positive trait for business

Given these, Adam's traits mostly align more with academics or fields that involve analysis, empathy, and abstract thinking, more than the typical traits for business administration students.

Computer Science:
- Curiosity about nature: Neutral, not directly related
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: Strongly positive, common among computer science students
- Warm-hearted, empathetic: Less typical, but useful in team settings
- High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: Strongly positive, necessary for computer science
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Positive trait for computer science

Given these, Adam's characteristics, particularly his analytical skills, quiet nature, puzzle-solving abilities, and appreciation for hard work, fit well within the profile typically associated with computer science students.

Based on these qualitative evaluations, here are the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This assessment suggests that Adam's personality traits are much more aligned with the field of computer science than with business administration.
