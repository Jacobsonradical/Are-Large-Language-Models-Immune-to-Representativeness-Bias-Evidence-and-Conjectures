The task requires computing the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field given his personality sketch. Given that we don't have actual prior probabilities or a more complex Bayesian model, I'll make an informed guess based on the described personality traits.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Traits such as strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work can align well with the field of Business Administration. However, traits like Enjoyment of solving puzzles, love for nature and animals, and understanding of abstract concepts are less directly relevant to this field.
   - Overall, it's less likely given the stated traits.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Traits such as high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, understanding and appreciation for abstract concepts, and strong empathy (which could lead to interest in human-centered computing or educational technology) align more closely with this field.
   - Along with a good fit for problem-solving and abstract thinking, this makes Computer Science a more likely choice.

Considering this informal analysis:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values don't sum to 1 since, as specified, Adam could also be enrolled in other fields more closely aligned with his curiosity about nature and love for animals, like Environmental Science or Biology.
