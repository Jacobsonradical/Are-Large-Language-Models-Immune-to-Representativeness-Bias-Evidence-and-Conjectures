To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific graduate field given his personality sketch, we employ Bayes' Theorem. However, without exact statistical data on the likelihoods of such personality traits among students in different fields, we will make qualitative estimates based on common associations.

Assumptions:
1. Personality traits like a genuine curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication are less common in business administration and more common in fields with a focus on nature or problem-solving.
2. High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts can be associated with both fields, but particularly with computer science.
3. Empathy and love for animals might correlate less with business administration than with fields like biology or environmental sciences, which are not considered here but will influence the assessment.

Given these qualitative factors, we can reasonably posit that Adamâ€™s characteristics seem to align better with fields requiring analytical and abstract thinking and possibly with a focus on nature and problem-solving, like computer science.

Estimated Posterior Probabilities:
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.35
}

These values reflect a higher likelihood for computer science but acknowledge that business administration is still a possibility, albeit lower.
