To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given the personality sketch provided, we need to consider how well his traits and interests align with the typical characteristics and interests of students in these fields.

- **Business Administration**: This field often attracts individuals who are interested in management, leadership, entrepreneurship, and organizational behavior. The emphasis is on strategic thinking, communication, and understanding business operations and economics.
  - Based on Adam's personality sketch, his interests in nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles do not typically align with the core interests or focus areas of business administration.
  - Therefore, the conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is relatively low.

- **Computer Science**: This field attracts individuals who are interested in problem-solving, logic, abstract thinking, and often have a strong curiosity about technology and computational systems.
  - Adam's high intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with traits commonly found in computer science students.
  - Therefore, the conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is higher compared to business administration.

Based on this reasoning:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values are not absolute and are intended to represent relative probabilities based on the given information. There are many other fields Adam could likely be in, such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology, which could fit his personality even better.
