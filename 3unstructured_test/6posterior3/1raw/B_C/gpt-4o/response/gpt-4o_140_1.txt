To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we need to estimate how well his characteristics align with typical traits associated with students in different fields. This involves some degree of subjective judgment since we are not provided with analytical data on the base rates of traits in these fields.

Given Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong empathy and love for animals
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's estimate the likelihood of these traits fitting each field:

### Business Administration
Typically, students in Business Administration might be expected to have traits such as leadership, strategic thinking, financial acumen, and possibly an interest in corporate environments. While Adam's traits of intelligence and appreciation for hard work align somewhat, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not directly suggest a strong fit for this field.

### Computer Science
Computer Science students often exhibit high intelligence, good problem-solving skills, a strong affinity for abstract concepts, and enjoyment in solving puzzles. Since Adam displays many of these qualities (enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts), this field appears to be a better match. However, his empathy and love for nature and animals, while they do not exclude computer science, are not directly indicative.

### Estimation
Combining the subjective judgment of fit for each of these fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.2, 
  "computer science": 0.6
}

This indicates that while there is some possibility Adam might be in business administration, the traits he displays are more typically aligned with those of someone who might be enrolled in computer science. The probabilities do not sum to 1 since there are other fields which could be an even better match for Adam's personality traits.
