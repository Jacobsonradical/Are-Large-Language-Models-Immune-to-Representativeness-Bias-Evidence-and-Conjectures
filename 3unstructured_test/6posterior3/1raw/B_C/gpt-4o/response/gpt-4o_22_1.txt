To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how Adam's traits align with each field. This requires some degree of subjective judgment since we lack specific base rate details and likelihood ratios for each field. Here's a rough estimation based on his profile:

- Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals suggest an inclination towards fields related to natural sciences or fields requiring high emotional intelligence and relational understanding.
- His enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts make a strong case for fields that require analytical and logical skills, such as Computer Science.
- However, his warmth and empathy may not align as closely with the stereotypical personality traits of a business administration student, often associated more with leadership, management, and strategic thinking rather than a deep appreciation for nature and empathy.

Based on these considerations:

{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.25
}

These values are indicative and assume that the personality traits provided are more strongly aligned with fields such as Computer Science due to his analytical skills and curiosity, with a lower probability for Business Administration given the more empathetic and nature-oriented facets of his personality.
