To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we typically consider the likelihood of someone with his characteristics being in these fields and the base rate (prior probability) of each field. However, without specific base rates or empirical data, we can only make reasoned qualitative judgments based on the provided traits compared to stereotypical characteristics associated with these fields.

Given Adam's personality sketch (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, etc.), we can qualitatively assess which field aligns better:

- **Business Administration**: This field often involves leadership, management, and decision-making skills. While people in this field can have diverse traits, the focus on nature, animals, and a quiet, puzzle-solving demeanor is less directly aligned with typical business administration tasks.

- **Computer Science**: This field highly values intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts. Problem-solving and puzzle-solving skills are crucial in computer science. Adamâ€™s curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts seem to align well with the requirements of computer science.

Using these qualitative assessments, we might state:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values suggest that, based on the personality sketch, Adam is significantly more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration. The values do not necessarily sum to 1, acknowledging that he may also fit well in other fields not considered here (e.g., biology, environmental science, etc.).
