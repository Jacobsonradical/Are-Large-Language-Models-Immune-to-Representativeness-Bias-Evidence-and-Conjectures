To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either of these fields given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits align with typical characteristics of students in these fields. 

Let's outline the key aspects of Adam's personality that might influence the likelihood of him being in each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles also fits within the typical interests of computer science students.
   - Quiet and having strong empathy might be less characteristic but not unexpected in the field.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Strong empathy and a warm heart are beneficial in business administration due to teamwork and leadership roles.
   - A strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are important here.
   - However, curiosity about nature and love for animals are less directly related to business fields.

Given these observations, let's make a heuristic estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

Please note these probabilities are subjective estimates based on the alignment of Adam's characteristics with typical profiles of students in each field. The actual likelihood would require additional statistical data and analysis.
