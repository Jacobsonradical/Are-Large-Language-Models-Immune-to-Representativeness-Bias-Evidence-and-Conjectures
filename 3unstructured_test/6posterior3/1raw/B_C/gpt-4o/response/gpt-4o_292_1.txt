To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we should use Bayes' theorem. However, without specific numerical prior probabilities or likelihoods for each field of study, we'll assume a qualitative approach based on how well his personality traits match typical characteristics of students in these fields.

Let's qualitatively assess the fit of his personality traits with each field:

1. Business Administration:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Not typically relevant
   - Quiet and enjoys puzzles: Less typical, as business often requires social interaction and teamwork
   - Warm heart, strong empathy: Relevant, especially for HR or management roles
   - Deep love for animals: Not typically relevant
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Relevant, but not specifically indicative
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant

2. Computer Science:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Not typically relevant, but general curiosity can be beneficial
   - Quiet and enjoys puzzles: Highly relevant, common trait among computer science students
   - Warm heart, strong empathy: Less relevant, but can be beneficial for fields like user experience
   - Deep love for animals: Not typically relevant
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Highly relevant, common trait among computer science students
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Highly relevant

Given this qualitative fit:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values indicate that based on his personality sketch, Adam seems much more likely to be a computer science student than a business administration student, although there is a smaller probability for the latter field as well.
