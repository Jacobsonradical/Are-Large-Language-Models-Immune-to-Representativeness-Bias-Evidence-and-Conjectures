To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we must rely on Bayesian reasoning and prior knowledge about the distribution of different personality types in those fields.

Given Adam's characteristics - curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, appreciation for hard work and dedication, strong empathy, and interest in solving puzzles - here are the probabilistic assessments:

1. **Business Administration:**
   Typically, students in Business Administration may have a focus on leadership, management, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship. While understanding abstract concepts and appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant, other aspects such as a deep love for animals, strong empathy, and curiosity about nature are less characteristic of students specifically in this field.

2. **Computer Science:**
   Students in Computer Science often have strong analytical skills, enjoy solving puzzles, and have high intelligence, traits that align well with Adam's personality. Although not directly related to animals and nature, these personalities do fit well into a Computer Science background.

Here is the posterior probability in the given format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values reflect the likelihood that Adam's personality aligns more closely with a Computer Science field based on the described traits, whereas the alignment with Business Administration is less probable but not impossible.
