To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we'll make some general assumptions about the correlation between Adam's traits and the characteristics typically associated with those fields.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence
- Good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits are generally more strongly aligned with scientific and nature-focused fields. Let's assign approximate conditional probabilities as follows:

**Business Administration:**
- Curiosity about nature and plants: not directly relevant
- Solving puzzles: somewhat relevant (strategy, problem-solving)
- Warm heart, strong empathy: moderately relevant (team management, leadership)
- Deep love for animals: not directly relevant
- High intelligence: relevant
- Understanding abstract concepts: relevant in strategy, finance
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: relevant

Given these points, Adam’s personality aligns somewhat but not strongly with business administration. 

**Computer Science:**
- Curiosity about nature and plants: not directly relevant
- Solving puzzles: highly relevant (algorithm design, debugging)
- Warm heart, strong empathy: moderately relevant (collaboration, team projects)
- Deep love for animals: not directly relevant
- High intelligence: highly relevant
- Understanding abstract concepts: highly relevant (logic, theory)
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: relevant

Given these points, Adam’s personality aligns quite well with computer science, especially considering his puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts.

Based on these considerations, I'll compute the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Please note these values are subjective and based on general correlations. In a real assessment, more specific data about Adam's background and interests would refine these probabilities.
