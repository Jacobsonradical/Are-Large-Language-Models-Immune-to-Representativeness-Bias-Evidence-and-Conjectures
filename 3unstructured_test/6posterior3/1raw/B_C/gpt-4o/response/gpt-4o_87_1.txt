To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality traits align with typical characteristics of students in those fields. This involves a subjective estimation based on common knowledge and the overlap of his traits with those usually found in each field.

Here is the evaluation for each field based on the provided personality sketch:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Not directly related.
   - **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**: Common trait among computer science students, as problem-solving and working on complex, abstract issues are integral to the field.
   - **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: Highly relevant, as computer science often requires strong analytical and conceptual skills.
   - **Warm-hearted, empathetic, deep love for animals**: Less directly relevant but not counter-indicative.
   - **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Relevant as CS requires diligence and persistence.

Given these aspects, there is a moderate to high probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his traits:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Generally not relevant.
   - **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**: Problem-solving is relevant but the quieter demeanor is less typical.
   - **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: Relevant, especially for strategic and high-level business courses.
   - **Warm-hearted, empathetic, deep love for animals**: Empathy can be an asset in business, especially in fields like HR or ethical business practices.
   - **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Highly relevant as business programs are often rigorous.

Given these aspects, his personality seems less aligned with the typical business administration student but still within a plausible range. Thus, the conditional probability is lower compared to computer science:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Note: These values are subjective and based on a qualitative assessment of Adam's traits in relation to typical characteristics seen in each field. They do not sum to 1 as stated, implying the possibility of other fields being a better fit.
