To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we must consider how well Adam's traits align with the typical traits and interests of students in those fields. Since we cannot provide exact values without hard data, we can provide reasoned estimates.

Given the personality sketch, we can infer the following alignments:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **High Intelligence:** Strong alignment
   - **Solving Puzzles:** Strong alignment
   - **Understanding Abstract Concepts:** Strong alignment

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **Strong Empathy and Warm Heart:** Moderate alignment
   - **Understanding and Appreciation for Hard Work:** Strong alignment

Using this insight, we can estimate the posterior probabilities informally:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These numbers reflect a reasonable estimation based on the alignment of Adam's traits with the typical interests and characteristics of students in each field, without exact statistical data.
