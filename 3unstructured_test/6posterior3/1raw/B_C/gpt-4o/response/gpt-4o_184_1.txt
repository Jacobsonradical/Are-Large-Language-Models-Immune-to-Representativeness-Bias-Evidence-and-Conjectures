To compute posterior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science, given his personality sketch, we need to base our assessment on the traits and characteristics described. Bayesian reasoning will be used, considering these traits:

1. A genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoyment in solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Additionally, we will consider baseline assumptions about how common Adam's personality traits are among graduate students in each field. However, please note this calculation is more heuristic and subjective, rather than based on precise statistical data. Given that we don't have exact prior probabilities, these estimations will be inferred logically.

First, let's consider the fit of the provided personality traits with the typical profiles of students in these fields:

### Business Administration
- This field often prefers traits like leadership, strong interpersonal skills, strategic thinking, and a penchant for organization and management.
- Business administration students might find solving puzzles and abstract thinking useful but may not necessarily prioritize curiosity about nature and empathy toward animals.

### Computer Science
- Traits like problem-solving abilities, enjoyment in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are highly aligned with what's expected in computer science.
- While not strictly necessary, a genuine curiosity about nature and a love for animals could be indicative of a more holistic and mindful person, fitting some computer science students particularly those interested in interdisciplinary fields like computational biology or sustainability.

Given Adam's described traits, they seem to align better overall with computer science given his love for puzzles and abstract thinking, even though not all computer science students may express his level of empathy towards animals.

Making reasonable estimations:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the fit of Adam's personality traits to the typical profiles in each field. He seems more likely to be pursuing computer science based on his interests and cognitive abilities, even while recognizing that other fields could exist where he'd fit even better.
