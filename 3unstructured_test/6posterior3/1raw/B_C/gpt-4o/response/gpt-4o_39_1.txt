To compute the posterior conditional probability, we need to rely on Bayesian inference. For a detailed and accurate computation, we would need the prior probabilities of students enrolling in business administration and computer science, as well as the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits in students from these fields. Since we don't have specific quantitative data, we will rely on educated assumptions based on the given personality traits and common associations with these fields.

**Assumptions:**

1. **Business Administration**: This field typically attracts individuals with strong leadership skills, interest in management, and analytical thinking. While Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work fit this field, his deep love for nature and animals along with his interest in abstract concepts might be less common in business administration students.

2. **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals who enjoy solving puzzles, have high intelligence, and understand abstract concepts. Adam's traits of curiosity, empathy, and problem-solving align well with attributes valued in computer science students. However, his strong empathy and love for animals are less prominently associated with computer science.

Based on these observations, we would have:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values are reflective guesstimates. Adam's personality sketch aligns more with computer science due to his interest in puzzles, high intelligence, and abstract thinking. While his characteristics are not entirely exclusive to computer science, they are less typical of business administration students. The other values are left out, considering they could fit into other fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology.
