To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider Adam's personality traits and how they might align with the typical characteristics of students in the given fields. Since we don't have explicit prior probabilities or more detailed contextual data on graduate field enrollment, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the provided description and known trends.

### Assumptions:
1. Adam's high intelligence, affinity for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts are strongly related to computer science.
2. His empathy, warm heart, appreciation for hard work, and preference for nature might align less directly with business administration but could still be relevant given certain subfields within business.

### Estimation:
1. **Computer Science:**
   - High intelligence and abstract thinking are key in computer science.
   - Enjoying puzzles aligns well with problem-solving in computer science.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Empathy and a warm heart can be beneficial in fields like human resources, marketing, or organizational behavior.
   - Appreciation for hard work is relevant, but less specific to business administration compared to computer science.

Given those assumptions:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,   // Strong alignment with traits like solving puzzles, high intelligence, and abstract thinking.
  "business administration": 0.3   // Traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work are relevant but less directly aligned.
}
```

These values are not derived from a quantitative model but represent a qualitative assessment based on the match between Adam's personality traits and the characteristics beneficial for each field.
