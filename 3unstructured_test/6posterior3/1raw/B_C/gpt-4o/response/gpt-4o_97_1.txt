To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific graduate field given his personality sketch, we can make use of our understanding of what traits and interests align with these fields. This is a qualitative estimation based on the provided personality sketch.

Given that Adam is described as having a high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, strong empathy, warm heart, genuine curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, and a deep love for animals, we can infer the following:

**Computer Science:**

Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the demands of computer science, which often involves solving complex problems and working with abstract algorithms. Additionally, his enjoyment of solving puzzles fits well with programming and computational thinking.

**Business Administration:**

While Adam's appreciation for hard work is a trait that can be beneficial in business administration, the rest of his personality traits—such as a deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and warm heart—do not typically align as strongly with the typical profile of someone in business administration.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These numbers are subjective and are meant to reflect the fit between Adam's personality traits and the typical demands and nature of these fields of study. The higher probability for computer science reflects a stronger alignment with his intellectual and problem-solving capabilities, whereas the lower probability for business administration reflects lesser alignment with the other traits described.
