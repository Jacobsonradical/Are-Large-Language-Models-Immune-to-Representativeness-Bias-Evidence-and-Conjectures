To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics match the typical attributes of students in these fields. Given the lack of specific numerical prior probabilities and likelihoods, our computation will be qualitative and it will approximate the likelihood based on the described traits.

Adam's personality traits include:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted, with strong empathy and a love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's analyze how these characteristics align with each field:

### Computer Science
1. **Solving Puzzles:** Strongly related to computer science, which often involves algorithmic thinking and problem-solving.
2. **High Intelligence & Abstract Concepts:** Highly relevant, as computer science requires understanding complex and abstract theories.
3. **Quiet Boy:** Not directly relevant, but could align with stereotypical introverted traits often associated with some computer science enthusiasts.
4. **Curiosity about Nature and Plants, Warm-hearted, Strong Empathy, Love for Animals:** These traits are less directly relevant to the field of computer science but do not exclude the possibility of Adam pursuing this field.

### Business Administration
1. **Warm-hearted, Strong Empathy:** These traits are quite valuable in business, particularly in leadership and human resources roles.
2. **Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication:** Highly relevant for business, which often requires significant effort and perseverance.
3. **Curiosity about Nature and Plants:** Less directly relevant, which might suggest a lower likelihood compared to fields more aligned with environmental studies or biology.
4. **High Intelligence & Understanding Abstract Concepts:** Valuable in business, especially in strategic planning and analysis.
5. **Enjoys Solving Puzzles:** Useful for problem-solving in business contexts such as case studies, but perhaps less central compared to computer science.

Based on these considerations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

This qualitative analysis suggests that Adam's personality traits align somewhat more closely with computer science than with business administration, though he could potentially fit into either field.
