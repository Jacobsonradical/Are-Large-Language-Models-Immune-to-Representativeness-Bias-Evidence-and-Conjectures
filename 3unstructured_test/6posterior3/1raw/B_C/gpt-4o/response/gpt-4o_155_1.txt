To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayesian reasoning. The personality traits given are more likely to align with certain fields of study. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:

1. **Computer Science:**
    - Curiosity about nature and plants: This trait is not strongly related to computer science.
    - Enjoys solving puzzles: This trait aligns well with computer science.
    - Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals: While these traits don’t strongly correlate with computer science, they don't exclude it either.
    - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: This trait strongly aligns with computer science.
    - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: This trait is generally applicable and thus neutral.

2. **Business Administration:**
    - Curiosity about nature and plants: This trait is not strongly related to business administration.
    - Enjoys solving puzzles: This trait is less directly related to business administration.
    - Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals: These traits might align with some aspects of business administration, particularly in areas like human resources or corporate social responsibility, but they don’t strongly indicate a match.
    - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: This trait also suits business administration but is less critical compared to computer science where abstract thinking is more central.
    - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Again, generally applicable and thus neutral.

Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems that the traits more strongly align with computer science than business administration. His interest in solving puzzles and abstract thinking are highly indicative of computer science. His empathy and love for animals aren't necessarily exclusive to either field but are less indicative of business-related interests.

Thus, we would estimate the posterior conditional probabilities, informally, as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect a higher probability for Adam being in computer science based on his personality traits relative to business administration, but not to the exclusion of other fields not considered here.
