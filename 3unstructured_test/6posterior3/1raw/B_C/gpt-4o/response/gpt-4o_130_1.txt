To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam's enrolment in business administration and computer science given his personality sketch, we will consider how well his personality traits align with the typical traits one might expect for graduate students in each of these fields.

- Business Administration: This field often attracts individuals who enjoy leadership roles, strategic thinking, networking, and organizational tasks. Adam's warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work could partially align with business administration, particularly in areas like human resources or organizational behavior where empathy and understanding others can be very valuable. However, the lack of specific mention of leadership, networking, or strategic thinking lowers the conditional probability somewhat.

- Computer Science: This field typically attracts individuals who have strong analytical skills, enjoy solving problems (puzzles), and often possess intellectual curiosity about abstract concepts. Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with the traits typical of computer science students.

Given these considerations and aligning with Bayes' Theorem intuitively, we can estimate the posterior probabilities accordingly:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood that Adam's traits are consistent with those of a computer science graduate student compared to a business administration student.
