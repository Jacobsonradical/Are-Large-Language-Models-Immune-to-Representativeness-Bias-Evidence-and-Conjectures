To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics match typical profiles of students in those fields.

Let's break down the compatibility:

1. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Not particularly relevant.
   - **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Strongly relevant; problem-solving is a core aspect of CS.
   - **Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals**: Not particularly relevant.
   - **High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts**: Highly relevant; CS often involves abstract and complex problem-solving.
   - **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Relevant, as CS studies and work can be intensive.

2. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Not particularly relevant.
   - **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Somewhat relevant, as business can involve strategic thinking and problem-solving.
   - **Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals**: Slightly relevant; empathy can be beneficial in management and HR areas.
   - **High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts**: Relevant, especially in strategic planning and complex business scenarios.
   - **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Relevant, as business programs can be demanding and require commitment.

Based on this analysis:

- The characteristic "enjoys solving puzzles" is highly consistent with CS.
- The empathy and love for animals might suggest a field like biology or environmental science more than CS or BA.

Assuming we have equal prior probabilities for any graduate field and no additional data to adjust these priors, the posterior would primarily be influenced by the above characteristics. The relevance ratings tilt slightly more in favor of CS due to the intellectual and problem-solving demands of the field.

Here are the subjective posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Note: These probabilities are estimates based on the given personality sketch and could vary with additional context or information.
