To compute the posterior probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, we would typically require additional information such as the prior probabilities of enrolling in each field and the likelihood of having the described personality traits given enrollment in each field. Given the absence of numerical values for these priors and likelihoods, we can make an informed estimation based on the personality sketch provided and the general characteristics common to students in these fields.

Adam's personality sketch indicates he has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy, a deep love for animals, high intelligence, and talent for understanding abstract concepts. He also values hard work and dedication.

Given these traits, let's manually assess the fit for each field:

1. **Business Administration**: Generally, this field attracts individuals who are interested in management, leadership, strategic planning, financial analysis, and organization. While Adamâ€™s empathy and appreciation for hard work could be beneficial here, his love for nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts do not strongly align with the typical subject matter of business administration.

2. **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and abstract thinking, which aligns perfectly with Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence. Moreover, the problem-solving nature of computer science and the appreciation for dedication can be very relevant.

Given this qualitative assessment, I would estimate the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

While these values are subjective, they reflect a stronger alignment between Adam's personality traits and the field of Computer Science compared to Business Administration.
