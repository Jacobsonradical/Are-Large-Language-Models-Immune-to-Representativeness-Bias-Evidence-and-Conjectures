To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, you generally use Bayes' theorem. However, without concrete prior probabilities and detailed statistical data, we'll need to base our estimates on the qualitative description of Adam's personality and interests. Given Adam's interests in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts, we can infer he is less likely to be in business administration (traditionally more associated with social skills, management, and economics) compared to computer science (which requires abstract thinking and problem-solving skills).

Hereâ€™s a reasoned estimation based on the provided description:

- **Computer Science**: While Adam's interest in nature and animals may not directly align with typical computer science motifs, his problem-solving skills, intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and empathy (useful in team projects or human-centered design aspects like user experience) align well. Thus, he has a notable chance of being in this field.
  
- **Business Administration**: His deep empathy and warm heart could align with people-oriented business roles, but his interests in plants and nature, as well as his reserved personality, suggest he might not fit the traditional business administration profile centered on organizational leadership, finance, and social interaction.

These probabilities reflect an informal interpretation. For precise probabilities, detailed statistics on personality traits and field enrollments would be required.
