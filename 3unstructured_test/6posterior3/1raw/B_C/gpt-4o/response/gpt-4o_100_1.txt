To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we will use a qualitative Bayesian approach. We must consider how well Adam's personality traits match typical profiles in each field.

First, let’s recap key points about Adam's personality:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart and strong empathy.
4. Deep love for animals.
5. High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
6. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

**Analysis:**

- **Business Administration:**
  This field generally attracts individuals interested in leadership, management, and economic systems. Key traits for success may include strategic thinking, people management, networking, and business acumen. While intelligence and appreciation for hard work are universally beneficial, Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are less directly aligned with typical business administration characteristics.

- **Computer Science:**
  This field typically attracts individuals who enjoy solving abstract problems, have high logical and analytical skills, and often have a strong interest in technology and mathematics. Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts closely align with common traits found in computer science students. While his empathy and love for animals are less directly relevant, they do not detract from the alignment.

Given this analysis, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

These probabilities reflect a qualitative assessment that Adam's personality traits strongly suggest a higher likelihood of enrollment in computer science compared to business administration.
