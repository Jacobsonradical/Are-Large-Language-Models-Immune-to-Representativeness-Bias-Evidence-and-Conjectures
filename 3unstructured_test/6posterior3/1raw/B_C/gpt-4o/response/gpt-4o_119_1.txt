To compute the posterior probabilities, we need to take into account the prior probabilities of students being in each field and how well Adam's personality sketch matches the typical traits and interests of students in each field. This is a Bayesian inference problem. However, without exact prior probabilities and more specific data, we can't compute exact values. We can reason qualitatively to estimate the conditional probabilities.

Adam's personality sketch suggests a strong affinity towards nature, animals, abstract thinking, and puzzles, which aligns more with fields that involve a high degree of intellectual curiosity and less so with business-oriented fields. Let's qualitatively evaluate:

1. Business Administration:
   - Typical traits: Focus on leadership, management, finance, economics, marketing, decision-making skills.
   - Adam: Shows empathy, quiet nature, curiosity about nature, and high intelligence but does not display typical business-driven characteristics.
   - Probability: Lower

2. Computer Science:
   - Typical traits: Problem-solving abilities, interest in abstract concepts, puzzles, logical thinking, and often an appreciation for theoretical work.
   - Adam: Enjoys solving puzzles, has a high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - Probability: Higher

Given this analysis, let's assign qualitative probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These probabilities reflect the judgment that Adam's personality traits and interests align more closely with computer science than with business administration.
