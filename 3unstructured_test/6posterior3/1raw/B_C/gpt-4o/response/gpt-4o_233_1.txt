To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to apply Bayesian reasoning. However, since exact priors and likelihoods are not provided, we will make educated assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch and typical characteristics associated with the fields of business administration and computer science.

1. **Business Administration (BA):** Considering the typical traits for BA students, they often need strong leadership, communication skills, and an interest in economics or business strategies. Adam's profile highlights curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and an inclination towards puzzles and abstract concepts. These traits do not strongly align with the stereotypical traits of business administration.

2. **Computer Science (CS):** Traits like high intelligence, problem-solving skills, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for dedication are very relevant for computer science. While his empathy and love for nature are not typical indicators for computer science, his enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence significantly support the alignment with this field.

Given these qualitative assessments, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

This means it is relatively more likely that Adam would be enrolled in Computer Science compared to Business Administration given his personality traits. Note, these are subjective estimations and not computed from exact probabilistic models.
