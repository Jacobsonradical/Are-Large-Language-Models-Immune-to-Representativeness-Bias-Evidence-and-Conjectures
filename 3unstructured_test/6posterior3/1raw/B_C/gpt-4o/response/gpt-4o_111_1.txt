To estimate the posterior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in either Business Administration or Computer Science given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' Theorem in a simplified, intuitive manner since we do not have explicit numerical probabilities. 

Bayes' Theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of A given B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of B.

We do not have explicit data for these probabilities, but we can make qualitative assumptions based on Adam's personality traits and their relevance to each field to provide intuitive estimates.

### Business Administration
Adam’s traits such as having a warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be beneficial in Business Administration for roles involving leadership or HR. However, his quiet nature and love for solving puzzles might not align as well with typical business administration tasks that often require strong networking and interpersonal skills.

### Computer Science
Adam’s love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and curiosity about nature point toward a fit with Computer Science. These traits are crucial for problem-solving, which is a significant part of computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can estimate the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

This estimate suggests Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in Computer Science than Business Administration, given his personality traits.
