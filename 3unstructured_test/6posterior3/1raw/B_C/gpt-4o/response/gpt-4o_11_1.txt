To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, one can employ Bayesian inference. Let us primarily inspect qualitative aspects from the sketch and subject them to prior common knowledge regarding the typical interests and predispositions of students in these fields.

1. **Business Administration**: This field typically attracts individuals with interests in management, entrepreneurship, and business operations. Traits such as leadership, negotiation, strategic thinking, and an inclination towards economic and financial matters are usually dominant. Adam's personality sketch, which emphasizes curiosity about nature, empathy, warmth, and a focus on puzzles and abstract concepts, does not align strongly with the stereotypical interests and skills valuable in business administration.

2. **Computer Science**: This field often appeals to individuals who enjoy problem-solving, puzzles, abstract thinking, and logical reasoning. Computer science also intersects with many areas of research, including artificial intelligence, theoretical fundamentals, and their applications to various domains including biology (aligning with his love for nature and animals). Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles strongly correlate with traits beneficial for success in computer science.

Given these alignments (without explicit prior probabilities), we can qualitatively estimate the conditional probabilities. Assuming a simplified model without strong prior biases:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.8
}

These values indicate that based on Adam's personality attributes, it is much more likely he was enrolled in computer science than in business administration, though other fields might also align with his interests and traits.
