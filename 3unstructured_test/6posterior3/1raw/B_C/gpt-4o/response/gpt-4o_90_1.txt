To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well each field aligns with his described traits, as well as the commonality of these graduate programs.

Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

Matching these traits to the fields:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Typically focuses on management, finance, marketing, operations, etc.
   - Requires an understanding of abstract concepts and dedication.
   - However, pure curiosity about nature and empathy for animals might not be strong fits here.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Often involves solving puzzles and abstract thinking (algorithms, theories, etc.).
   - Nature and animal empathy are less directly related but do not conflict strongly.
   - High intelligence and a capability for hard work are strong fits.

Keeping these considerations in mind, we would assign lower posterior probabilities for business administration as compared to computer science because the latter aligns more closely with Adam's traits.

Here is the computed posterior conditional probability:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Note: These values are qualitative judgments based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the fields provided. The actual computation in a precise Bayesian framework would require prior probabilities and specific likelihood functions which we donâ€™t have here.
