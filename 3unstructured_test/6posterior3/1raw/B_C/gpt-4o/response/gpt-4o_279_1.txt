To compute the posterior conditional probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimation of an event based on new evidence. However, since we lack precise base rates (prior probabilities) and the likelihood percentages, we can instead make educated estimates based on the provided information.

It's necessary to consider how well Adam's personality traits match typical profiles in the fields of computer science and business administration.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **High Intelligence**: This fits well with computer science, which often requires strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
   - **Solving Puzzles**: This also aligns well with computer science, where algorithmic thinking is crucial.
   - **Curiosity about nature and plants**: This aligns less directly but could fit under scientific inquiry.
   - **Empathy and love for animals**: Less directly relevant but not entirely exclusive.
   - **Understanding abstract concepts**: Highly relevant as computer science often deals with abstract theoretical concepts.

Considering these factors, let's estimate the conditional probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science:

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **High Intelligence**: Relevant to business strategies and decision-making.
   - **Solving Puzzles**: This fits with problem-solving in management and business operations.
   - **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Less directly relevant to business.
   - **Empathy and love for animals**: Could be relevant, especially in fields like CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) or HR.
   - **Understanding abstract concepts**: Relevant but in a different context (e.g., economic theories, market analysis).

Considering these factors, let's estimate the conditional probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration:

Given that the subject's attributes are more directly aligned with the typical characteristics of a computer science student, I will make the following educated estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These numbers reflect a higher likelihood of computer science due to the stronger alignment of Adam's personality traits with characteristics generally found in this field. The business administration estimate reflects a decent but lower probability given the somewhat relevant characteristics. Remember, these are educated guesses in the absence of precise base rates and probabilities.
