To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits match with the typical profiles of students in these fields. 

Given Adam's high intelligence, strong empathy, curiosity about nature and plants, and love for animals, here's a possible assessment:

- **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals with strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which align with Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. However, his strong empathy and love for animals suggest a disposition that might be more common in life sciences or humanities. Nonetheless, his intelligence and problem-solving skills still make him a potential fit.
  
- **Business Administration**: Business students tend to have strong interpersonal and organizational skills, which doesn't strongly align with Adam's quieter personality and preference for animals and nature. Business administration would typically attract someone more extroverted and possibly less focused on abstract problem-solving.

With these considerations, here is a reasonable computation:
  
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

This suggests that while computer science is somewhat likely given his personality and intelligence, business administration is less likely due to a poorer alignment with his personal interests and traits.
