To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam's fields of enrollment given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, to do this rigorously, we need additional key pieces of information that aren't provided:

1. The base rate (prior probability) of students enrolled in Computer Science and Business Administration graduate programs in 2021.
2. The likelihood of a person with Adam's personality traits enrolling in each of these programs.

Nonetheless, given the personality sketch provided, we can make some qualitative assessments to estimate these probabilities:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Curiosity about nature and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles also aligns well with the logical problem-solving nature of the field.
   - High intelligence is a general trait beneficial in any demanding academic field, including computer science.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Strong empathy and warm heart could be beneficial in human-centric fields like business administration.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication is valued in business administration, but it's a more generic trait.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's estimate the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.4
}

These values are subjective estimates based on Adam's personality sketch relative to the fields described. In a more rigorous analysis, we would adjust these values based on actual statistical data and precise definitions of relevant traits for each field.
