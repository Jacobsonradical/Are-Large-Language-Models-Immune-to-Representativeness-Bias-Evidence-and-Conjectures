To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we need to make an educated guess based on the information given. Bayesian analysis typically requires prior probabilities and a likelihood function, but due to the absence of specific data, I'll rely on the textual description to make a reasonable estimate.

Let's assess the relevance of each field to Adam's personality traits:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Not particularly relevant.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Somewhat relevant; problem-solving can be important in business strategy.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy: Relevant; business administration often involves working with people.
   - Deep love for animals: Not directly relevant.
   - High intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts: Relevant; business planning and strategy can involve abstract thinking.
   - Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant; business administration certainly requires dedication.
  
   While some traits align, the lack of strong ties to nature, animals, and abstract concepts central to Adam’s character makes business administration less likely.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Indirectly relevant if focused on bioinformatics or similar fields.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Highly relevant; coding and algorithmic thinking involve puzzle-solving.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy: Not directly relevant, though it can be useful in teamwork scenarios.
   - Deep love for animals: Not directly relevant unless working in areas like computational biology.
   - High intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts: Highly relevant; computer science is deeply rooted in abstract thinking.
   - Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant; successful computer science work requires dedication.

Given his strong interest in problem-solving and abstract concepts, coupled with high intelligence, Computer Science seems to align more closely with his traits.

Based on this qualitative analysis:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values indicate that given Adam’s personality sketch, he is more likely to have been enrolled in Computer Science than Business Administration, but there is still a reasonable probability for him to be in Business Administration considering the variety of fields that graduate students can engage in. The remaining probability would be distributed among other potential fields not listed here.
