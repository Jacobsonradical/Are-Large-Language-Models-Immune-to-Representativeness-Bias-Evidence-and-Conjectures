To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities, we'll make use of Bayesian reasoning. This involves considering the likelihood of Adam's personality matching typical characteristics of students in each field, combined with the prior probabilities of students being in each field.

1. **Personality Match to Business Administration and Computer Science**:
   - **Business Administration**: Business students often prioritize leadership, strategic thinking, and networking skills. While Adam's traits like high intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant, his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are less aligned with typical business traits.
   - **Computer Science**: Computer Science students often exhibit traits such as high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and an interest in abstract concepts. Adamâ€™s love for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts fits well within the Computer Science field.

Given these character trait alignments, we can qualitatively assess the likelihoods:
   - **Business Administration**: Lower alignment.
   - **Computer Science**: Higher alignment.

2. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - To refine the posterior probabilities more precisely, we would need actual enrollment data, but we can assume that the proportions of students in each field provide some baselines:
     - A rough estimation might suggest that a smaller percentage of graduate students are in Business Administration than in Computer Science in a STEM-focused university.

Combining these qualitative findings with assumed general trends, we can estimate:

{
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "computer science": 0.65
}

These values suggest that Adam is significantly more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science given his personality traits than in Business Administration.
