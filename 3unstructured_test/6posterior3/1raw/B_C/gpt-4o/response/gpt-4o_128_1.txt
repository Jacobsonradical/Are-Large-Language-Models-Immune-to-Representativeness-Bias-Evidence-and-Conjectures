To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, to fully compute these probabilities, we would need precise data on the base rates (prior probabilities) of students enrolled in each field and the likelihood of students in these fields having Adam's personality traits. Since exact statistical data isn't provided, we can make an educated estimate based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with typical traits observed in each field.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Traits that align: High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles.
   - Traits that somewhat align: Curiosity about nature and empathy (though less directly related to typical computer science curriculum, they still fit the broader profile of a thoughtful and analytical individual).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Traits that align: Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, warm heart (could be related to leadership qualities).
   - Traits that somewhat align: Curiosity about nature and deep empathy (these are less commonly emphasized but can be relevant in certain areas like corporate social responsibility).

Using these alignments qualitatively, we can make a reasonable estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are not definitive but represent a balanced estimation based on how well Adam's traits align with common characteristics in each field. Computer Science gets a higher probability due to stronger alignment with key traits like high intelligence, problem-solving, and abstract thinking. Business Administration, while less aligned, still presents some potential connections through traits like empathy and dedication. 

Again, these are estimates and should be interpreted as such. For precise probabilities, more specific data on the distribution and overlap of these fields with the described personality traits would be needed.
