To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the fields of computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, since we lack specific statistical data on the base rates (prior probabilities) and likelihoods, we can make some reasoned qualitative estimates based on the given personality traits.

Adam's personality sketch suggests that he has a natural curiosity, enjoys solving puzzles, and has high intelligence and abstract thinking ability. These traits align well with computer science, which often involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and technical curiosity.

His warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals suggest a lean towards fields that value and incorporate such traits, but these attributes are less directly aligned with the analytical and competitive nature often associated with business administration programs.

Without exact numerical values, I'll provide a reasoned estimation based on the personality profile:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood for computer science based on the given characteristics, while still acknowledging that there could be a non-negligible probability for business administration.
