To determine the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider Adam's personality traits and how well they align with the typical characteristics of graduate students in the fields of computer science and business administration. Adding some assumptions about the base rates of these fields among graduate students will also help refine our estimates.

Based on Adam's personality sketch:

- He enjoys solving puzzles, indicating logical and analytical thinking, which is common in computer science.
- He has a high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, also aligning well with the demands of computer science.
- His curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are traits less directly related to computer science, but they don't exclude it.

- Business administration students often have strong social skills, persuasive abilities, and a focus on management/leadership. Adam's traits like empathy are beneficial in this field, but his strong curiosity about nature and solving puzzles don't align as directly with business administration as they do with computer science.

Given these considerations, it's reasonable to assign higher probability to Adam being in computer science than in business administration.

Let's quantify these intuitions:

{
  "computer science": 0.65,  // High probability given his analytical skills and interest in puzzles
  "business administration": 0.25  // Medium probability due to his empathy and appreciation for hard work, but less alignment with typical business administration traits  
}
