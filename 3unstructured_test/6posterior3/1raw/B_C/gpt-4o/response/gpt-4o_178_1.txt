Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have a curiosity about nature, an interest in solving puzzles, empathy, and a love for animals. These traits are less typical for a business administration student and more consistent with fields related to natural sciences or theoretical and problem-solving domains. Thus, the posterior conditional probability for business administration is relatively low.

For computer science, a field known for requiring high intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving skills, Adam's personality traits are somewhat aligned. Hence, the posterior conditional probability is higher for computer science compared to business administration, but it is still not very high because his specific interest in nature and animals might imply a closer fit to natural sciences or biology-related fields. Nevertheless, he could still pursue computer science due to his problem-solving skills.
