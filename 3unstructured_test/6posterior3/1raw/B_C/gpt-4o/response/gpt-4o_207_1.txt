To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning, particularly focusing on how well his personality traits align with typical traits of students in these fields.

Here's how we approach the problem:

1. **Assess the Fit of Personality Traits**:
   - **Computer Science**: Problem-solving ability, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant. While a quiet demeanor and love for nature and animals aren't specific indicators, they don't contradict.
   - **Business Administration**: A strong appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant. However, strong empathy and a deep love for animals align less directly with typical business administration traits.

2. **Estimate Likelihoods**:
   - Let's assume the likelihood of Adam's personality traits fitting the stereotype for computer science students is quite high.
   - For business administration, we assume a lower likelihood due to the relative mismatch in traits like empathy and animal love.

3. **Assume Prior Probabilities**:
   - We don't have specific priors, but let's assume they are equally likely given a generic distribution of students across fields.

Given this reasoning, we'll approximate the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

To be clear, these probabilities are subjective approximations based on the given personality sketch and how it aligns with stereotypical traits in each field. They reflect the likelihood of enrollment given the alignment of traits with each field.
