To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning. However, without specific data on the prior probabilities of enrollment in these fields and the likelihood of someone with Adam's personality sketch being enrolled in each field, we can only make qualitative inferences.

Given Adam's personality traits:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
2. Quiet demeanor, enjoys solving puzzles
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
4. High intelligence, good at abstract concepts
5. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

We can evaluate how well these traits align with typical profiles of students in computer science and business administration.

### Computer Science
- Enjoying solving puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science, as the field requires problem-solving skills and abstraction ability.
- Quiet demeanor can be common among computer science students, who often engage in independent or small-group work.
- However, the strong empathy and deep love for animals are not specifically aligned with typical computer science traits, though they don't exclude the possibility.

### Business Administration
- Strong empathy and understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are traits that can be highly beneficial in business administration, especially in roles requiring leadership and team management.
- A genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals are less directly related to business administration.

Given these qualitative alignments:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Here, the higher probability for computer science reflects the alignment with Adamâ€™s analytical and problem-solving traits, while business administration is still possible due to his empathy and appreciation for hard work but is slightly less aligned with a strong curiosity about nature and love for animals. These values are informed estimates and would be better refined with empirical data or more detailed analysis.
