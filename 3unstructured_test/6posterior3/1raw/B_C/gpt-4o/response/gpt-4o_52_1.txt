To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we should consider the likeliness of students possessing such characteristics in each field. Given that we don't have concrete statistical data, we will base our probability estimates on general trends and stereotypes about these fields.

**Computer Science:**
- Computer Science students often possess high intelligence and the ability to grasp abstract concepts.
- Problem-solving skills and a love for puzzles align well with computer science.
- Intellectual curiosity and understanding of complex systems can be a strong fit for someone in this field.

**Business Administration:**
- Strong empathy and understanding of people often benefit business administrators.
- Leadership and social interaction skills are key, which doesn't align as directly with Adam's quiet nature.
- The appreciation for hard work can certainly be a trait seen in business students, but it is not as uniquely defining.

Based on the qualitative assessment, we can judge the suitability and hence the conditional probabilities approximately as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

This estimation suggests that given Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science than Business Administration, but not exclusively so.
