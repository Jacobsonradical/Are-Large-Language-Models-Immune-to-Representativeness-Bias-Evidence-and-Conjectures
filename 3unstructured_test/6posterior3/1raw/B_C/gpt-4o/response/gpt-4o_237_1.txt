To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field based on his personality sketch, we should consider how well his described traits align with the characteristics typically associated with each field.

### Overview of Adam's Personality:
1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals**
4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**
5. **Appreciates hard work and dedication**

### Analysis of Fields:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Traits that align: Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, quiet nature (preference for solitary work).
   - Traits that don't specifically align: Interest in nature and love for animals (less directly related to the field but doesn't preclude it either).

Based on this, we can assume that the probability of Adam being in computer science would be moderately high due to his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Traits that align: Appreciates hard work and dedication.
   - Traits that don't specifically align: Curiosity about nature, quiet nature, strong empathy, and love for animals (these are not typically the primary traits associated with business administration, which often values leadership and extroversion).

Based on this, we can assume that the probability of Adam being in business administration might be relatively lower because his personality does not align as closely with the stereotypical attributes of business students.

### Posterior Conditional Probabilities:

Using qualitative reasoning based on typical graduate student profiles in each field, we can propose the following probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These probabilities reflect that Adam's personality and interests seem more closely aligned with the profile of a computer science student compared to a business administration student.
