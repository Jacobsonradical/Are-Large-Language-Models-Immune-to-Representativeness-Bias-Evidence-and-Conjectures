To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well Adam’s characteristics align with stereotypical traits and skills pertinent to these fields. This is essentially applying Bayes' Theorem in a qualitative sense since we don’t have exact prior probabilities and likelihoods. 

Based on Adam’s personality sketch:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these traits, let's evaluate each field:

### Business Administration
Typical traits for business administration might include:
- Interest in economics, management, and organizational structures.
- Strong communication and leadership skills.
- Focus on financial metrics and market trends.
- Typically higher extroversion levels and networking skills.

Adam’s traits like empathy, high intelligence, and understanding hard work do align to some extent, particularly empathetic leadership, but interests in nature and puzzles don’t strongly align with core business administration competencies.

### Computer Science
Typical traits for computer science might include:
- Strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
- Interest in abstract concepts and logical thinking.
- Enjoyment of puzzles and algorithmic challenges.
- Introverted tendencies to some degree.

Adam seems to align better with the characteristics common in computer science students, given his curiosity about nature and puzzles, intelligence, and interest in abstract concepts.

### Conclusion
Based on the alignment of Adam’s personality traits with the characteristics commonly associated with the two fields, the probabilities can be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Please note that these values are rough estimates based on qualitative alignment and not exact calculations based on data.
