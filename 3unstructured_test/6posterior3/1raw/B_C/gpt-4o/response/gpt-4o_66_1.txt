To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration based on his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. However, we are missing some key pieces of information such as the prior probabilities of a student being in these fields and the likelihood of a student in these fields having Adam's personality traits. Despite this, we can still make some qualitative assessments based on his stated characteristics.

Given state probabilities without formal math might look like:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence, curiosity about nature, and knack for solving puzzles make him a good candidate for computer science. Students in computer science often display high intelligence and problem-solving skills. Therefore, the probability that Adam is in computer science seems quite plausible.

2. **Business Administration**: While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work and dedication might be advantageous in business administration, his deep love for animals and interest in nature are less strongly aligned with this field. Business administration students are often characterized by strong leadership and communication skills, which don't particularly stand out in Adam's personality sketch.

Therefore, we can reasonably assess the following probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are arbitrary and based more on the qualitative match of Adam's interests and traits with the typical stereotypes of these fields.
