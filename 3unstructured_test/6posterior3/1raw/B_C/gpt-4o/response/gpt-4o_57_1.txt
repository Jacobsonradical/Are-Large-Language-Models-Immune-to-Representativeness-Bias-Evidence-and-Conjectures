To calculate the posterior conditional probability, we can consider the personality traits mentioned in Adam's sketch and the typical personality traits of individuals likely to be enrolled in specific graduate fields. However, without concrete base rates or additional data, we will have to rely on qualitative inference.

Let's assign probabilities based on the alignment between Adam's personality traits and the general traits often associated with each field.

### Personality Traits and Field Alignment:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Curiosity about nature and its various plants: Neutral alignment.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Strong alignment (problem-solving is crucial in CS).
   - Warm heart, strong empathy: Slightly neutral/weak alignment (not specifically relevant or irrelevant).
   - Deep love for animals: Weak alignment (not specifically relevant).
   - High intelligence: Strong alignment (CS requires high intelligence).
   - Good at understanding abstract concepts: Strong alignment (CS involves abstract thinking).
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Strong alignment (CS requires dedication).

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Curiosity about nature and its various plants: Weak alignment (not specifically relevant).
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Moderate alignment (problem-solving is important in business strategy).
   - Warm heart, strong empathy: Strong alignment (empathy is important for management).
   - Deep love for animals: Weak alignment (not specifically relevant).
   - High intelligence: Strong alignment (business administration requires intelligence).
   - Good at understanding abstract concepts: Moderate alignment (abstract thinking can be useful in strategic planning).
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Strong alignment (business requires dedication and hard work).

Based on these qualitative alignments, here's an estimate for the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, along with the ability to understand abstract concepts, gives a strong indication he might be a good fit for computer science.
- **Business Administration (0.4)**: While empathy and appreciation for hard work are highly relevant, Adam's strengths in abstract concepts and puzzles also point towards computer science slightly more strongly.

Note that these are not definitive probabilities but educated estimates based on the personality traits you've provided. More accurate probabilities would require additional data on base rates and a more detailed analysis.
