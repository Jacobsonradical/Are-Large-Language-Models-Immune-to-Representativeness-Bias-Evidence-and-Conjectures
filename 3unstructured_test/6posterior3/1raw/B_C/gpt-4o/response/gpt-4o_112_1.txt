To determine the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we can informally apply Bayes' theorem. For a more rigorous computation, we would ideally use specific priors and likelihoods based on empirical data. However, given the narrative and the traits provided, we can make some informed assumptions.

Here's a brief informal analysis:

1. **Personality and Interests**:
   - **Nature, plants, animals**: Suggests a potential interest in fields related to biology, ecology, or environmental studies.
   - **Solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts**: Could indicate an aptitude for technical or analytical fields.
   - **Empathy and warm heart**: Suggests he might have an interest in fields involving people or social work. 

2. **Field Match**:
   - **Business Administration**: Typically involves leadership, management, strategic thinking, and possibly networking or social skills. While Adam’s empathy could be relevant, his strong interest in nature and animals does not directly align with this field.
   - **Computer Science**: This field requires a strong ability to understand abstract concepts and solve puzzles – both of which align with Adam’s described skills. However, computer science might not fully capture his interest in nature and animals unless he is working on computational biology or related fields.

With these considerations, the personality sketch suggests Adam is less likely to have chosen Business Administration and is somewhat more likely to have chosen Computer Science, given his interest in puzzles and abstract thinking.

Here's an estimation in numerical terms:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values are heuristic and based on subjective interpretation of the provided sketch rather than precise statistical analysis. The remaining probability would be distributed over other possible fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology.
