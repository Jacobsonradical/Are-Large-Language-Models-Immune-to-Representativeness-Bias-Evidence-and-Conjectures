Explanation: Given Adam's high intelligence, affinity for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, it seems quite likely that he could be enrolled in a field requiring strong analytical skills like computer science. His genuine curiosity about nature and empathy might align less with the typically quantitative and competitive nature of business administration. Therefore, the conditional probabilities reflect a stronger inclination towards computer science given the personality traits described.
