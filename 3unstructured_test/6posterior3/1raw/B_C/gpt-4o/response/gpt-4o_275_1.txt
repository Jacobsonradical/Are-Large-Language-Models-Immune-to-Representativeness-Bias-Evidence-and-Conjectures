To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either Business Administration or Computer Science given his personality sketch, we need to consider the characteristics that align with each field and how likely they are to fit Adam's described personality.

### Business Administration
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants: Not particularly relevant.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Can be somewhat relevant but more typically associated with fields that involve systematic problem-solving or logical thinking, such as engineering or computer science.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals: Not typically associated with business administration, which often emphasizes strategic thinking and management skills.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: Definitely relevant to business administration, which often requires strategic thinking and problem-solving.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Definitely relevant, as business administration can be rigorous and demanding.

Overall, while there are some aspects that align, others are less relevant to the typical profile of a business administration student.

### Computer Science
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants: Not directly relevant, but curiosity in general can be a trait for a computer science student.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Highly relevant, as computer science involves a lot of problem-solving and logical thinking.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals: Less relevant, as these traits don't particularly align with the field of computer science.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: Directly relevant, since computer science requires such skills.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Definitely relevant, as the field requires a high level of dedication and effort.

Given these considerations, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities based on how well Adam's personality traits align with the demands and typical characteristics of each field.

Note: These values are not derived from any specific statistical model or dataset but are rather reasoned estimates based on aligning Adam's described characteristics with the common requirements and traits of each field.
