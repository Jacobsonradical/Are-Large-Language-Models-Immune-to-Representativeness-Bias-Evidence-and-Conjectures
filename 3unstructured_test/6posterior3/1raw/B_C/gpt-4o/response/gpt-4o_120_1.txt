To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields, we need to consider his personality traits and how they align with typical characteristics of students in those fields. However, without specific base rates or more context, we'll make some informed qualitative assessments based on personality fit rather than precise quantitative calculations.

Given Adam's personality traits:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted with strong empathy
- Love for animals
- High intelligence with ability to understand abstract concepts
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

We'll qualitatively assess the likelihood of each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence fit well with the logic and problem-solving skills required in computer science.
   - Understanding abstract concepts is a strong match for theoretical aspects and algorithmic thinking.
   - While his empathy and love for animals are not directly related, they do not rule out the field.
   - Overall, these traits suggest a reasonable fit for computer science, though not all traits align perfectly.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Empathy and strong appreciation for hard work can align with people management and organizational tasks.
   - However, the lack of explicit interest in business topics or leadership traits makes this a less immediate fit.
   - His strong orientation towards nature and animals may indicate a preference for fields more closely related to those interests.

With these qualitative assessments, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect a greater alignment of Adam's personality traits with computer science compared to business administration, but acknowledge that exact figures need more detailed data and context.
