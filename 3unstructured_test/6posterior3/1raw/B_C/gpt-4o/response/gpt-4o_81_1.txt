To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either "computer science" or "business administration" given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits align with typical traits of students in these fields. Although we don't have exact statistical data, we can use qualitative reasoning to estimate these probabilities.

Adam's traits:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm-hearted, empathetic, and loves animals.
4. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
5. Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

For "computer science":
- Enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align well with traits typical of computer science students.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work also fit well with the rigors of computer science.
- However, a love for nature and animals is less directly relevant, though it doesn't necessarily conflict.

For "business administration":
- Empathy and a warm heart can be valuable in business, particularly in areas like human resources or corporate social responsibility.
- Appreciating hard work and dedication aligns well with business disciplines.
- However, enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are less typical primary traits for business students.
- A curiosity about nature and animals is also less directly relevant to business administration.

Given this qualitative analysis, we might assign the following posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6, // Adam's puzzle-solving skills and abstract thinking suit this field.
  "business administration": 0.3 // Adam's empathy and dedication suit this field somewhat, but other characteristics are less aligned.
}
```
