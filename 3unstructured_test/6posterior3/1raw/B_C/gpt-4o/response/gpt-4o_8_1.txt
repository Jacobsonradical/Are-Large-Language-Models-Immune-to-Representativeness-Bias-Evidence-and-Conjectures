To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we need to assess the compatibility of Adam’s personality traits with the typical characteristics and requirements of students in those fields. While this is a subjective assessment, Bayes' theorem provides a useful framework. However, in the absence of concrete prior probabilities and likelihoods, we will use a qualitative approach based on the given personality sketch.

### Personality Traits:
1. **Curiosity about nature and plants** – This suggests interest in biological sciences or environmental studies.
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles** – This trait is commonly associated with analytical and abstract fields like computer science, mathematics, or any research-oriented discipline.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals** – These traits could be more aligned with fields like biology, veterinary sciences, environmental sciences, or social sciences.
4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts** – Again, this aligns well with computational fields, theoretical disciplines, and possibly certain aspects of business analytics.
5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication** – This is a general trait that can apply across many fields.

Now let's assess the posterior conditional probabilities:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam’s empathy and appreciation for hard work could fit well in business roles that are team-centric or involve leadership.
   - However, his curiosity about nature and love for animals is not typically associated with business administration.
   - Overall, while possible, it is less strongly suggested by the personality traits provided.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - His enjoyment of solving puzzles and capability with abstract concepts is highly compatible with computer science.
   - While a love for animals and nature is not directly related, these traits do not contradict a penchant for computer science.
   - Overall, computer science aligns well with his analytical and problem-solving skills.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can sketch the posterior probabilities. While we cannot precisely compute these without more data, intuitively and qualitatively:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This estimation considers that Adam's personality aligns more closely with computer science due to his analytical and abstract reasoning skills, as well as his enjoyment of puzzles. The lower probability for business administration is due to the less direct compatibility with his given traits, although it remains a potential field.
