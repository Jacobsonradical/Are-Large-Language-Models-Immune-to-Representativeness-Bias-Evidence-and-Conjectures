To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, it's important to consider Bayes' Theorem. However, we lack the specific quantitative base rates and likelihoods needed for a precise calculation. Instead, we can make a qualitative assessment based on Adam's personality sketch.

Based on Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

We can infer the following:

1. Business Administration:
   - While empathy, understanding, and appreciation for hard work are relevant to this field, Adam's interest in nature, animals, and solving puzzles align less strongly with typical characteristics of a business administration student, who often focus on leadership, management, and economic strategies.

2. Computer Science:
   - High intelligence, solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts are directly relevant traits for computer science. His curiosity could drive him to explore complex problems in this field, although his love for nature and animals might be less directly relevant. Nonetheless, these interests do not preclude pursuing computer science.

Given these considerations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These values qualitatively reflect Adam's alignment with each field, taking into account his personality traits and common attributes of students in these graduate programs.
