To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which in its simplest form is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of event \( A \) given \( B \).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of event \( B \) given \( A \).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event \( A \).
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of event \( B \).

Given Adam's personality sketch and assuming equal priors due to lack of specific information, we can focus primarily on \( P(B|A) \), his personality traits given the field.

For each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles also aligns well with computer science.
   - Empathy and warm heart are neutral traits in relation to computer science.
   - Curiosity about nature and plants is not directly related but doesnâ€™t negatively affect likelihood.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are valuable but less diagnostic.
   - Empathy and a warm heart are positive traits for leadership and management.
   - Curiosity about nature and plants is less relevant.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication fits well with a demanding academic environment.

Given these observations, I will provide the posterior probabilities while acknowledging that these are qualitative assessments and should ideally rely on more statistical data for precision.
