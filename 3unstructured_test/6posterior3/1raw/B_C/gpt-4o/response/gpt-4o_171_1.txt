To provide an answer with the given constraints, we can apply Bayesian reasoning, taking into account the likelihood of Adam's personality traits aligning with each field, as well as the base rates (prior probabilities) of students enrolling in these fields.

Firstly, letâ€™s outline certain general assumptions based on stereotyping and general common knowledge:
- Graduate students in business administration are often seen as outcome-oriented, competitive, and focused on leadership, finance, and management. They might not typically be characterized by a deep love for nature and animals or a preference for solving puzzles.
- Graduate students in computer science are often characterized by strong intellectual curiosity, problem-solving skills, and a proclivity for abstract thinking, which fits Adam's profile quite well.

Considering these observations, we can qualitatively estimate the probabilities. Here are the resultant posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values represent a qualitative reasoning based on Adam's described traits and how well they match the typical profiles seen in each field. Of course, more precise values could be computed with actual statistical data regarding the distributions of personality traits in these fields.
