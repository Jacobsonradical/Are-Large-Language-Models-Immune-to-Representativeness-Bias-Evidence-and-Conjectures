Sure, let's break this down based on the information given:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam shows traits of high intelligence and an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, which are essential qualities for success in computer science. His enjoyment of solving puzzles also aligns with the problem-solving nature of this field. While his strong empathy and love for animals do not directly correlate with computer science, they do not preclude him from being involved in the field.

2. **Business Administration**: While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is vital in business administration, his other traits—curiosity about nature, enjoyment of puzzles, empathy, and love for animals—do not strongly align with the attributes typically emphasized in this field. Business administration often focuses on leadership, management skills, and a strong inclination towards social interaction and networking, which are not prominently mentioned in his personality sketch.

Given the above analysis, we can make a probabilistic judgment. Note that these are inferred values:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These probabilities reflect that Adam's personality traits are more closely aligned with the attributes beneficial for a career in computer science compared to business administration.
