To compute the posterior probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam’s personality sketch aligns with the typical characteristics and interests of students in each of these graduate fields. While we may not have precise base rates or detailed empirical data for exact calculations, we can make informed estimates based on qualitative analysis.

Based on Adam’s personality sketch:

- **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits are indicative of a strong fit for computer science, where logical problem-solving and conceptual thinking are paramount. Although his curiosity about nature and strong empathy are not specific to computer science, they do not preclude his enrollment in that field.

- **Business Administration**: Adam has strong empathy and a warm heart, which can be valuable in business administration for leadership, team dynamics, and understanding customer needs. However, his deep love for animals and curiosity about nature seem less aligned with the traditional interests of business administration students. Moreover, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts leans more towards fields like engineering, sciences, or computer science rather than business administration.

Given this qualitative assessment, we can make informed estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood that Adam would be involved in a field like computer science, given his puzzle-solving skills and abstract thinking capabilities. The probability for business administration is lower due to the less direct alignment with his deep curiosity about nature and love for animals.
