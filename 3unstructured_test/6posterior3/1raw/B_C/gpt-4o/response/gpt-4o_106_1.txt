To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem. Although we don't have exact prior probabilities or likelihoods, we can make educated guesses based on Adam's personality sketch and the general characteristics associated with each field.

1. **Computer Science**:
    - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are strong matches.
    - Enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns well with computer science.
    - However, his love for nature, plants, and animals seems less directly relevant.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - Appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant.
    - Strong empathy and warm heart are important in many business contexts, especially those involving leadership or human resources.
    - Less direct connection with his curiosity about nature and abstract thinking.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can assign approximate probabilities favoring the more aligned traits.
