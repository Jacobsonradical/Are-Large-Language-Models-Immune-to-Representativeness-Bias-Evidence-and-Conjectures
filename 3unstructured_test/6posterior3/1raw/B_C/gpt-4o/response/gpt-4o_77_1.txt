To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in business administration and computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics align with typical traits and interests of students in these fields. Here's a breakdown of our reasoning:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Traits such as a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, and high intelligence could be relevant, but other traits like a deep love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles are less typical for business students.
   - Often, business administration students might exhibit more direct leadership, strategic thinking, and interest in business practices rather than a strong curiosity about nature or abstract concepts.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - High intelligence and being good at understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant traits for computer science students.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles also aligns well with the analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science.
   - A quiet disposition can also be common among computer science students, potentially more than in the business administration field.

Based on this qualitative assessment, we can derive the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values indicate that Adam's personality traits and interests are more strongly aligned with those typical of computer science students than business administration students. The total does not sum to 1, as there are several other potential fields of study that could fit Adam's personality sketch.
