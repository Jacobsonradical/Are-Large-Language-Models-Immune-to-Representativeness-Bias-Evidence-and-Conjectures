Please note that these probabilities are subjective estimates based on the personality sketch provided. Adam's intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and understanding of abstract concepts point towards a likelihood of enrollment in computer science, especially since this field often attracts individuals with such traits.

Although the personality sketch doesn't prominently feature traits typically associated with business administration, there is still some possibility, albeit lower, given his empathy and warm-hearted nature, as these can be valuable in business roles.

Additionally, these estimates leave room for Adam being enrolled in other fields that align with his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and possibly even fields like biology, ecology, or environmental science.
