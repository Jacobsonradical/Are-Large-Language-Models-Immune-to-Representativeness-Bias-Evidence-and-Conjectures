To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam being enrolled in computer science or business administration based on his personality sketch, we would use Bayes' Theorem. However, in the absence of specific priors and detailed likelihood information, I'll provide a qualitative assessment based on the sketch.

Adam's traits include:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles
- Strong empathy and love for animals
- High intelligence
- Good understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Given these traits, let's estimate the likelihoods:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles: Common among computer science students.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Important in computer science.
   - Quiet personality: Could fit the typical profile of some computer scientists.
   - Appreciation for hard work: Necessary in any demanding academic field.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Empathy and strong interpersonal skills: Valuable in business administration.
   - Appreciation for dedication: Important in business.

However, enthusiasm for nature, plants, and animals is less directly relevant to the typical profiles for these fields, which may slightly lower the probabilities for both but more significantly for business administration.

Given the above qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

These values reflect the higher alignment of Adam's skills and interests with computer science compared to business administration based on his personality sketch.
