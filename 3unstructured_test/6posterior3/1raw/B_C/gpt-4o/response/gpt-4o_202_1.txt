To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science given his personality sketch, we can use some form of Bayesian reasoning, incorporating prior probabilities and the likelihood of his personality traits given each field of study. However, we have limited data, so we have to make some simplified assumptions. Here is a conceptual breakdown:

1. **Priori probabilities**: Let's assume the proportion of graduate students in business administration and computer science.
2. **Likelihoods**: How likely Adam’s characteristics are given each field of study.

Since specific numbers are not provided, I'll assume equal priors for simplicity. Let's say:
- \( P(Business Administration) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(Computer Science) = 0.5 \)

This might not reflect real-world proportions, but it simplifies our calculations.

Next, consider the likelihoods:
- Adam’s traits match typical students in his field.

Given Adam's strong affinity towards nature, puzzles, empathy, and abstract concepts:
- These characteristics are more strongly associated with students in fields like biology or environmental sciences over business administration.
- These traits are also positively associated with computer science, where problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and curiosity are important.

We can qualitatively estimate these likelihoods without exact values:
- \( P(Traits|Business Administration) \) is likely lower.
- \( P(Traits|Computer Science) \) is likely higher.

Combining these intuitively estimated likelihoods, the posterior for each field looks like:

If the prior for both fields is 0.5:
- \( P(Traits|Business Administration) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(Traits|Computer Science) \approx 0.7 \)

By Bayes' theorem for posteriors:
- \( P(Business Administration|Traits) \approx P(Traits|Business Administration) * P(Business Administration) \)
- \( P(Computer Science|Traits) \approx P(Traits|Computer Science) * P(Computer Science) \)

Given equal priors, the approximate posteriors:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3 * 0.5 = 0.15,
  "computer science": 0.7 * 0.5 = 0.35
}
```

So the conditional probabilities would be approximately:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

Keep in mind that these are very rough estimates, depending heavily on qualitative assessments and generic traits. For more accurate probabilities, more specific statistical data on traits and field distributions among graduate students would be needed.
