To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to rely on Bayesian reasoning, considering the personality sketch as our observational evidence. We can use the given attributes and match them with the likelihood of someone with those traits to be in each of the mentioned fields. However, since we are missing specific datasets on the likelihoods and prior probabilities, the answers are more qualitative and based on inference.

Letâ€™s review the personality traits given:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warmhearted with strong empathy.
4. Deep love for animals.
5. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
6. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

**Business Administration:**
- This field generally requires strong social skills and a competitive nature. Empathy and dedication are important, but a strong curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals are less directly relevant. 
- Given Adam's more introspective and empathetic traits, as well as an apparent preference for abstract thinking and possibly less socially interactive environments, the likelihood he's in business administration is lower based on the provided sketch.

**Computer Science:**
- This field highly values problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, and intelligence. 
- A person who enjoys solving puzzles would fit well here. High intelligence, quiet demeanor, and a strong sense of dedication are also good matches for someone in computer science. 
- While curiosity about nature and love for animals are less indicative, they do not conflict with the other traits fitting computer science.

Given these observations, the computed posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the qualitative assessment that Adam's traits align more closely with the field of computer science than business administration, given the provided sketch.
