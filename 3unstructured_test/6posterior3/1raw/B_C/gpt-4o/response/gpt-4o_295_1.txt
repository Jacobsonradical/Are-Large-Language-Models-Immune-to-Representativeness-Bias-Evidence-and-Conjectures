To compute the posterior probabilities, we can apply Bayes' Theorem, though we don't have complete data. Nonetheless, we can make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch.

Adam has a high intelligence and loves solving puzzles, which are traits that align well with computer science (CS). CS also involves abstract thinking, which he is good at. His empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work might not be significant factors for CS, yet they don't detract from it either.

Business administration could align with his appreciation for hard work and empathy, but these traits are less distinctive for a graduate field compared to CS.

Considering all these factors, we can qualitatively assign higher probability to CS based on Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence.

Here's a reasonable estimation:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These probabilities suggest that Adam's personality is more indicative of someone in computer science than in business administration, but without exclusive data, other fields are still possible.
