To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' theorem. However, without concrete prior probabilities and specific likelihoods of his personality traits given his enrollment in each field, we'll have to rely on qualitative reasoning based on the given information.

Let's break down Adam's personality traits and how they might influence his likelihood of being in each field:

1. **High Intelligence and Understanding Abstract Concepts**: This trait suggests a possible fit for fields that require strong analytical skills, such as computer science.
2. **Genuine Curiosity about Nature and Plants**: This suggests a potential interest in fields related to biology, environmental science, or botany. It doesn't strongly point towards either computer science or business administration.
3. **Enjoys Solving Puzzles**: This is a trait often associated with computer science due to its problem-solving nature.
4. **Warm Heart, Strong Empathy, Deep Love for Animals**: These traits suggest an inclination towards fields involving care and understanding of living beings, which again could be more common in biology or veterinary fields.
5. **Strong Understanding and Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication**: This is a more general trait that can apply to any field but underscores a capacity for perseverance in demanding areas.

Given these considerations, it's more likely that Adam's personality and interests align with computer science because of his enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence/abstract thinking. Business administration seems less directly connected to his identified interests and traits.

Here is an educated estimate based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Please note that these probabilities are not precise calculations but rather qualitative assessments based on the given personality traits. The presence of other fields that might be an even better fit (like environmental science or biology) is not reflected in these probabilities.
