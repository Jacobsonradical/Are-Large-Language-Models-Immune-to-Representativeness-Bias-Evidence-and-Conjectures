To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam's enrollment in computer science and business administration given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. However, we don't have specific base rates of enrollment for these fields or likelihoods based on the personality traits. Instead, I'll make reasoned qualitative estimates based on typical characteristics associated with these fields and Adam's traits.

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - Positive Indicators: High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, problem-solving skills (enjoys solving puzzles).
   - Neutral Indicators: Quiet nature might align with stereotypes but isn't definitive.
   - Negative Indicators: No strong interest in technology or computers mentioned, empathy and love for nature and animals are not typically associated with computer science.
  
2. **Business Administration**: 
   - Positive Indicators: Appreciation for hard work and dedication can be significant in business contexts.
   - Neutral/Negative Indicators: No direct mention of leadership skills, people management, or business interest. The empathy and love for nature and animals might not align closely with the stereotypical business profile.

Given these qualitative assessments, Adam's personality seems more aligned with computer science than with business administration, though it cannot be said with high certainty.

Here are my reasoned qualitative estimates for the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect that Adam is somewhat more likely to be in a field that aligns with abstract problem-solving and intelligence, with lower likelihood for business administration given the lack of direct indicators associated with that field. Note that these estimations are subjective and could be adjusted with more specific data.
