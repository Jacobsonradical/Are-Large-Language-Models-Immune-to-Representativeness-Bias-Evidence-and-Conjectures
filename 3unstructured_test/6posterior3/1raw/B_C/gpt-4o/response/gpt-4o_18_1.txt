To compute the posterior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science, we need to consider how well his personality traits align with the typical traits and interests associated with each field. This involves some level of subjective judgment in interpreting the likelihood.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, warm and empathetic nature, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, we can assess his fit for each field as follows:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Business administration typically requires strong leadership, strategic thinking, and often involves social interaction and managing relations.
   - While Adam's appreciation for hard work and intelligence could be relevant, his empathy and curiosity about nature, along with his quiet demeanor, are less typical for this field.
   - His interest in nature and puzzles suggests more of an analytical and research-oriented inclination rather than a business one.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Computer science heavily involves solving puzzles, abstract thinking, and a deep intellectual engagement with technical problems.
   - Adam's high intelligence, puzzle-solving enjoyment, and abstract thinking align well with the skills needed for computer science.
   - His empathy and love for animals, while not directly related, are not incompatible with computer science.

Taking these into account, we might assign higher likelihoods to fields that match his interests and personality traits more closely:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

This assessment suggests that it is much more likely, given Adam's personality sketch, that he was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration.
