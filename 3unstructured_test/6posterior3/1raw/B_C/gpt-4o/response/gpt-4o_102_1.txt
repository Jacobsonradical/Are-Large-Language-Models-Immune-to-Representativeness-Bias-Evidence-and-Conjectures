To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science based on his personality sketch, we'll need to apply Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific base rates (prior probabilities) for graduate students in each field, we'll use some qualitative reasoning.

Adam has attributes that make him more suited to fields that value curiosity, abstract thinking, empathy, and a love for nature and animals. We will assume that graduate admissions and programs in computer science and business administration take interest and traits somewhat into account, though not exclusively so.

Given these considerations:

- Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals is less relevant to computer science but suggests potential interest that isn't typically associated with business administration.
- His skills at solving puzzles, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science.
- Empathy and appreciation for hard work could be useful in both fields, though empathy has a prominent place in business administration related to organizational behavior, management, and teamwork.

With these observations, we might surmise:

- "business administration" may have some moderate alignment due to his empathy and appreciation for hard work but lacks alignment with his scientific curiosity and interest in nature.
- "computer science" has strong alignment due to his problem-solving abilities, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, even though his love for nature and animals is not directly relevant.

Thus:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Note: These values are heuristic estimates based on qualitative reasoning rather than precise probabilistic calculations. They reflect a higher probability that Adam would align with computer science given his intellectual and problem-solving traits, while not entirely ruling out business administration due to his empathy and understanding of effort.
