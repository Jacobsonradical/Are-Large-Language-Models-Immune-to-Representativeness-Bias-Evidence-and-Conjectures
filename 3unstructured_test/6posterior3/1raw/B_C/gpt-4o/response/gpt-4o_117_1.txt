**Reasoning:**

Given Adam's personality sketch, it's more likely that he is interested in fields that align with his curiosity about nature, abstract thinking, and strong empathy. His traits suggest a propensity for subjects that involve analytical thinking and problem-solving but also show a strong sense of empathy and curiosity about natural elements.

- **Business Administration**: This field typically involves managing organizations, leading people, and strategizing for business success. Although intelligence and an understanding of hard work and dedication are important in this field, Adam's personality sketch does not strongly reflect interests in corporate strategy or leadership. Instead, he seems more inclined towards science and nature than managing a business, thus a lower probability.
  
- **Computer Science**: This field involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and often requires a strong understanding of theoretical and algorithmic conceptsâ€”all traits Adam possesses. Additionally, computer science can have applications in understanding nature through data analysis, simulations, or algorithms in biological contexts, which may also align with Adam's curiosity about nature and appreciation for hard work and dedication. Therefore, the probability is higher compared to Business Administration.
