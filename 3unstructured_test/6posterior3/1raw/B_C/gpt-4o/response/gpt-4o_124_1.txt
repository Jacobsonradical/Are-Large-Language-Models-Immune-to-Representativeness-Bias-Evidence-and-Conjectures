To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his described traits fit the typical student profiles in those fields. However, without specific empirical data, we can rely on qualitative assessment based on common characteristics.

Adam's traits can be mapped to each field as follows:

### Computer Science:
- **Genuine curiosity about nature and abstract concepts:** High relevance; understanding abstract concepts and curiosity are key traits.
- **Solving puzzles:** Very relevant; problem-solving skills are crucial in computer science.
- **High intelligence:** Relevant; often found in fields requiring strong analytical and logical skills.

Given these characteristics, it seems plausible that Adam could have been enrolled in computer science based on his traits.

### Business Administration:
- **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication:** Relevant; business administration often involves recognizing and valuing effort and persistence.
- **Empathy and warm heart:** Relevant; while not a primary trait, effective leadership and management often benefit from empathy.
- **Love for animals:** Less relevant; this trait doesnâ€™t particularly point towards business administration.

Given Adam's interests and personality, it seems less likely that he would choose business administration, which often focuses more on human interaction, leadership, and management skills rather than his stated interests in nature, animals, and solving puzzles.

Based on these considerations, a qualitative posterior conditional probability estimation might look like this:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Note: These values are rough estimates based on qualitative assessment rather than strict statistical computation, as the latter would require more specific data on base rates, likelihoods, and prior probabilities.
