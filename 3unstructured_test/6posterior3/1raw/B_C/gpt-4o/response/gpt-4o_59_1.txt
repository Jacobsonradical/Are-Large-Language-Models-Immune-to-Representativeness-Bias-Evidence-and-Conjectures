To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field (business administration or computer science), we need to consider how likely his personality traits fit each field, often through the application of Bayes' Theorem. However, as specific base rates and likelihood functions are not provided, we will rely on qualitative reasoning. 

Given Adam's personality sketch:

- **Curiosity about nature and plants** implies a leaning towards natural or life sciences more than business administration.
- **Enjoys solving puzzles** is a trait highly relevant to computer science.
- **Warm heart and strong empathy** might be less typical for computer science but do not necessarily exclude it.
- **High intelligence and abstract thinking** fit well with both computer science and business administration.
- **Deep love for animals and appreciation for hard work** might be more inclined towards fields that involve ethical considerations or hard sciences.

Based on this qualitative analysis:

- **Business Administration**: Someone in this field generally focuses on management, economics, leadership, and might not typically be described with such a deep connection to nature and animals.
- **Computer Science**: The love for puzzles, high intelligence, and abstract thinking are strong indicators that fit well with this field.

Thus, for the two fields mentioned:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

It's important to note these are rough estimates and actual probabilities should ideally be derived from more detailed statistical data.
