The provided personality sketch gives us some specifics about Adam's characteristics: a deep love for animals, a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a quiet demeanor, warmth and empathy, intelligence and abstract thinking skills, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. Given these traits, we can consider how well they align with the typical characteristics of students in different fields of study. 

While exact probabilities would ultimately require detailed statistical data, we can make educated estimates based on common associations with these fields.

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators that align well with a field like computer science. However, the specific interest in nature, plants, and animals doesn’t directly align with computer science but doesn't exclude it either. Quiet demeanor, puzzle-solving, and intelligence also fit a typical computer science student. Given this mixture, the probability isn’t extremely high but should be significant.
   
   Let's approximate a probability around 0.4 for computer science.
   
2. **Business Administration**: 
   - While business administration values intelligence and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, the subject’s specific interests and empathy for animals and nature seem less aligned with what is typically expected from students in business administration, who often have interests in economics, management, and leadership. Given this misalignment, the probability that Adam was studying business administration is likely lower than for computer science.
   
   Let's approximate a probability around 0.1 for business administration.

Here is the output in the requested format:
