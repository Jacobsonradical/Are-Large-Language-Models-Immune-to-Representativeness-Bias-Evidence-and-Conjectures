To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how his traits align with typical characteristics and interests of students in these fields. 

Key traits to consider include:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's analyze the fit with each field:

**Computer Science**:
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators.
- Enjoying solving puzzles is another strong fit, as problem-solving is a core part of computer science.
- The trait of curiosity, while more aligned with nature, may still complement the exploratory and innovative aspects of computer science.
- Less pronounced fit with empathy and love for animals unless working in a specialized area (e.g., AI for wildlife conservation).

**Business Administration**:
- High intelligence is relevant.
- Strong empathy and warm heart can be beneficial in roles that require leadership and interpersonal skills, such as in business.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is a strong fit as business programs are rigorous.
- Love for nature and animals is less directly related.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles might align more with strategy-oriented parts of business.

Given these considerations, our probability estimates are as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These values reflect the relative fit of Adam's traits with each field, but acknowledge that his specific interest in nature and animals might make him more or less likely to choose a different field altogether, such as biology or environmental science.
