To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either computer science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific base rate data (the prior probability of a student enrolling in each field), we will rely on qualitative reasoning based on the provided personality traits.

Bayes' Theorem formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \dfrac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of event \( A \) occurring given \( B \) has occurred.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of event \( B \) occurring given \( A \) has occurred.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event \( A \).
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of event \( B \).

### Analysis:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam shows a high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, both of which are highly relevant to computer science.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles is also a quality that aligns well with programming and algorithm development.
   - However, no direct mention has been made about interest in technology specifically, which is a critical aspect of computer science.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - He has strong empathy and a warm heart, which could be beneficial in business fields like human resources, marketing, and customer relations.
   - The appreciation for hard work and dedication fits well with business administration, which often involves managing people and projects.
   - However, there is no explicit mention of interest in business, economics, or organizational behavior.

Given these considerations, the posterior conditional probabilities might focus more heavily on the traits aligning with computer science but still leave a possibility open for business administration:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These probabilities reflect a qualitative assessment based on the provided personality sketch, where computer science seems more likely but with room for the possibility of business administration given his empathetic and hard-working nature.
