To compute the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, for a more qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch, we can infer some plausible likelihoods based on the alignment of his traits with common characteristics needed in those fields.

Adam's traits include:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
2. Quiet demeanor
3. Enjoyment of solving puzzles
4. Warm heart and strong empathy
5. Love for animals
6. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
7. Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits seem to align more closely with fields that involve analytical thinking, problem-solving, and an appreciation of natural life. 

- **Computer Science**: Fields like this often require high intelligence, abstract thinking, problem-solving, and dedication. Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and good understanding of abstract concepts align well.
- **Business Administration**: Typically, business administration benefits from good interpersonal skills, leadership, and a focus on organizational and management skills, which Adam's personality sketch does not emphasize directly.

Given Adam's personality sketch and its alignment with the requirements of these fields, we might estimate the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These estimates reflect that Adam's personality and interests seem better matched to computer science than business administration, though without specific base rates or more detailed information, these are qualitative approximations rather than exact probabilities.
