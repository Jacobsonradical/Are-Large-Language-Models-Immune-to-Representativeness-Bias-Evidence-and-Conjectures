  "business administration": "0.1"
}

### Explanation:
Considering Adam's personality sketch, the probability that he was enrolled in business administration appears relatively low. 

- **Nature and Plants**: This interest aligns more closely with fields related to biology, environmental science, or botany.
- **Quiet and Enjoys Solving Puzzles**: These traits are indicative of someone who may excel in analytical fields such as mathematics, computer science, or engineering.
- **Warm Heart, Empathy, and Love for Animals**: These characteristics suggest a potential fit for fields such as psychology, social work, or veterinary studies.
- **High Intelligence and Understanding of Abstract Concepts**: Again, this points towards intellectually demanding fields but may not necessarily correlate with business administration.
- **Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication**: While hard work is valued in all fields, it is not a distinguishing factor that leans toward business administration specifically.

Taking these factors into account, while it's not impossible for Adam to have enrolled in business administration, the probability seems relatively low compared to other fields that align more closely with his interests and personality traits. Hence, the posterior conditional probability is estimated to be around 0.1.
