To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we'll utilize Bayes' theorem in a qualitative manner. Nevertheless, without exact numerical probabilities, we can make an informed estimate.

Let's break down the elements of Adam's personality sketch and see how they align with a field in business administration:

1. **Curiosity about nature and plants**: This trait does not specifically align with business administration.
2. **Solving puzzles**: This could somewhat correlate with problem-solving skills required in business, but it is not exclusive to business administration.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals**: These traits are more aligned with social sciences, psychology, biology, or fields focusing on human and animal welfare, rather than business administration.
4. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: Business administration requires intelligence and the ability to grasp abstract concepts like market dynamics and financial theories. 
5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This can align with virtually any field, including business administration.

Considering these points:
- While Adamâ€™s traits of intelligence and appreciation for hard work could align with business administration, his other traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) make it less likely compared to fields more directly related to his interests and personality. 

Thus, the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration, considering his personality traits mentioned:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

This value suggests that it's possible, but not highly likely, considering the mismatch between his primary interests and the typical traits necessary for business administration.
