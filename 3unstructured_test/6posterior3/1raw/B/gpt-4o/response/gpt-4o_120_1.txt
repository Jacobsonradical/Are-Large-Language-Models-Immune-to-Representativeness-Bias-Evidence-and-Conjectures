To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to take into account his described qualities and how they match up with a typical profile of a business administration student. However, in absence of additional specific data, I can only provide an educated guess based on the information provided.

Adam's characteristics include:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoyment of solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
5. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Business administration students typically are interested in areas like management, finance, economics, and organizational behavior. While these fields can attract a wide variety of personalities, there are certain aspects of Adam's description that are less typical for a business administration profile (e.g., love of nature, empathy towards animals). 

Given this, the likelihood of Adam studying business administration might be lower compared to fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology.

Based on these insights, a rough probability estimate might be as follows:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
