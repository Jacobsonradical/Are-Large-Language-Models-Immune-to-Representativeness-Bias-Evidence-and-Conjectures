To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to take into account several factors. Specifically, we'll consider the likelihood that someone with Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, etc.) would be in this field.

Based on Adam's described personality, it seems that his interests and strengths might align more closely with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration. Therefore, the likelihood of him being enrolled in business administration appears lower.

Given this qualitative assessment, we can approximate the posterior probability as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.2
}

This value is relatively low because Adam's traits are more indicative of someone interested in fields other than business administration. However, it is not zero, as it's still possible that someone with his characteristics could be in that field if other influencing factors were in play.
