To compute a precise posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch would typically require detailed prior knowledge about graduate students in various fields within the U.S., which isn't provided here. However, we can use reasoning based on the information given.

Adam's interests and personality traits suggest that he might be more inclined towards fields related to nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving rather than business administration. Therefore, his likelihood of being in a field such as biology, environmental studies, or a related scientific domain is presumably higher than being in business administration.

Given that there's no statistical data to accurately quantify the posterior probability, we can still make a qualitative assessment. His traits such as empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are less aligned with typical characteristics sought in business administration students.

Taking all this into consideration, we can estimate that the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is low, but not zero because some students with varied interests and personality traits do pursue business administration degrees.
