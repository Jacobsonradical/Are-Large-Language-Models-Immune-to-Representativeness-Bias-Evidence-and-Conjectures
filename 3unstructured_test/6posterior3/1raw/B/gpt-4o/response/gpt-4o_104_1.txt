To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how likely his traits are in that field compared to other fields.

Given Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits suggest a stronger alignment with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration. Business administration generally requires traits like leadership, strong interpersonal skills, and a focus on economics and management rather than empathy and love for nature and animals.

Given this, we can make an educated guess that the probability Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low.

Here is the posterior conditional probability based on the given information:
