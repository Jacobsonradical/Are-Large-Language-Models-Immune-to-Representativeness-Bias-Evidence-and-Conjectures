To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to evaluate how well his attributes align with the typical characteristics and interests of students in the field of business administration. 

Adam's personality sketch includes:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
2. Quiet personality
3. Enjoys solving puzzles
4. Warm heart and strong empathy
5. Deep love for animals
6. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
7. Strong understanding and appreciation of hard work and dedication

Business administration students typically exhibit:
1. Interest in management, finance, and entrepreneurship
2. Strong communication and leadership skills
3. Analytical and strategic thinking abilities
4. Preference for structured environments and problem-solving in a business context
5. High work ethic and strong dedication

Given Adam's attributes, there isn't a strong alignment with the typical traits of someone pursuing business administration. Instead, his interests and strengths seem to align more with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or perhaps academic research roles in science or related fields rather than a business-centric curriculum.

However, it's not impossible for someone with Adam's attributes to be in business administration since high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciating hard work are relevant in any academic field. Still, the match is relatively low. 

So, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch might not be high.
