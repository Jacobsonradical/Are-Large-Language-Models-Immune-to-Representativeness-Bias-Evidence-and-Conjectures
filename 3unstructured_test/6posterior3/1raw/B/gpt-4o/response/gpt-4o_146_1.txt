To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can only provide a qualitative estimate based on the description.

Adam is characterized as having a genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, a fondness for animals, and strong problem-solving skills. These traits suggest a personality more aligned with fields such as environmental science, biology, psychology, or similar areas rather than business administration.

Given this qualitative assessment, we would expect the probability of Adam being in business administration to be relatively low. 

Based on this understanding, the posterior probability can be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

This value reflects a qualitative assessment rather than a precise calculated probability.
