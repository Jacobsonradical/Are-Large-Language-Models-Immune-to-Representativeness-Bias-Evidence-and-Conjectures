To compute the posterior conditional probability, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( B \) is the event of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Given that we don't have exact probabilities, we must make some qualitative assessments based on the description provided for Adam's characteristics and how they fit with typical characteristics of business administration students.

1. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration. Let’s assume that students in business administration are less likely to have strong empathy towards animals and nature, and more likely to focus on business matters. So, \( P(B|A) \) is likely low.

2. **Prior \( P(A) \)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is studying business administration without knowing anything about his personality. Assuming all fields are equally likely and not having other specific information, we could consider the proportion of graduate students in business administration fields.

3. **Evidence \( P(B) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch regardless of the field. Given Adam’s characteristics, such personality traits might be more frequent in fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, rather than business administration.

Given these considerations, we could argue that the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) is likely on the lower end of the spectrum.

Using qualitative reasoning, we might estimate the posterior probability to be around 0.1, acknowledging that it’s more of an educated guess without precise data.
