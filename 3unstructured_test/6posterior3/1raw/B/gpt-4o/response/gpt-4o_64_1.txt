To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well the characteristics described align with the typical traits and interests of students in that field. 

Traits:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
2. Quiet nature, enjoyment in solving puzzles
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
4. High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Business administration typically requires skills in leadership, management, economics, finance, strategy, and effective communication. While high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant to any field, the specific interests in nature, empathy for animals, and solving puzzles seem less aligned with business administration.

Given this mismatch, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low. 

{
  "business administration": 0.1
}

This estimate reflects a low likelihood that Adam was pursuing a degree in business administration based on his personality traits and interests.
