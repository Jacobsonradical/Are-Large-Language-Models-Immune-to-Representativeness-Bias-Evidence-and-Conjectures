  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, interest in solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest that he might be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration. While it is not impossible for someone with his traits to be in business administration, the probability is relatively low compared to fields more aligned with his interests and traits. Therefore, the posterior conditional probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration given his personality is around 0.1.
