Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems unlikely that he would be enrolled in a business administration program. His strong curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, empathy, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles align more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or even certain sectors within computer science or engineering that deal with nature and abstract concepts. Business administration generally attracts individuals interested in management, finance, marketing, and organizational leadership, which doesn't seem to match Adam's depicted interests and skills. Therefore, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low.
