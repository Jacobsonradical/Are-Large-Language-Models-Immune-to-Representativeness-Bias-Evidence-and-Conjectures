To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a business administration field given his personality sketch, we will need to make some assumptions based on the given information and our general knowledge about the traits that typically align with certain fields of study. This is a simplified form of Bayesian reasoning.

We know the following about Adam:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits are more commonly aligned with fields such as environmental science, biology, ecology, psychology, or perhaps philosophy. Business administration typically requires skills and interests such as leadership, strategic thinking, financial acumen, and a strong interest in commerce and organizational behavior, which are not obviously highlighted in Adam's personality sketch.

Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality would appear to be relatively low.

Given this qualitative assessment, we can assign a lower probability to the field of business administration. 

{
  "business administration": 0.1
}

This value (0.1) is somewhat arbitrary but reflects the low compatibility between the described personality traits and the typical profile of a business administration student, based on the provided information.
