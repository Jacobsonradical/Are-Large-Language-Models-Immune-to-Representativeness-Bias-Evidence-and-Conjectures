Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy suggest he might be more inclined towards fields like environmental science, biology, or related areas. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could apply to many fields. However, the warm heart and strong empathy might steer him less towards a ruthlessly competitive business environment. The appreciation for hard work and dedication is a more universally applicable trait. Therefore, while it is possible, it is less likely that someone with Adam's personality profile would pursue business administration compared to other fields more aligned with his interests and characteristics.
