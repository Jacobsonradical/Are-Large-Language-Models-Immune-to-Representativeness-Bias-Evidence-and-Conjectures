To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch across all fields.

However, exact numerical values for \( P(B|A) \), \( P(A) \), and \( P(B) \) are not provided in the problem. But we can discuss the likelihoods qualitatively.

1. **Prior Probability (P(A))**: This is the general likelihood of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration. Considering that business administration is a common field of study, \( P(A) \) might be relatively moderate compared to highly specialized fields.
  
2. **Likelihood (P(B|A))**: This is the probability of Adam having the described personality traits if he were studying business administration. Key traits include a curiosity about nature, enjoyment of puzzles, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work. These traits don't specifically align with typical business administration characteristics, which are often more focused on leadership, economics, finance, strategy, and similar skills. Therefore, \( P(B|A) \) might be lower.

3. **Overall Probability (P(B))**: This is the general likelihood of a student having Adam's personality traits across all fields of study. Since the traits align more with fields involving nature, animals, and abstract thinking (perhaps biology, environmental science, etc.), \( P(B) \) might be higher when considering Adam's field of interest overall.

Given these qualitative assessments, the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) might be relatively low.

So, based on the personality sketch and the qualitative analysis:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

This value is an estimation based on the qualitative mismatch between the typical traits of business administration students and Adam's personality traits.
