  "business administration": 0.2
}

Here's a brief reasoning: Adam's personality traits don't particularly align with typical characteristics one might associate with a strong inclination towards business administration. His empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest a more scientific or humanitarian field of study. However, it is still possible that someone with these traits might choose business administration, particularly if they have a specific interest in running or managing organizations that align with his interests (e.g., a non-profit related to animal welfare or environmental conservation). Given this, a probabilistic assessment of 0.2 seems reasonable.
