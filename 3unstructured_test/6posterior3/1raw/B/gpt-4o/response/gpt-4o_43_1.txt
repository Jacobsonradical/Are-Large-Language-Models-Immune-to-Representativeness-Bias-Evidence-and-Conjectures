To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of A given B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of B.

Given Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

These suggest that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in a field such as biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration, which typically prioritizes traits such as leadership, strategic thinking, financial acumen, and social skills.

Therefore, the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) of his personality traits given he's enrolled in business administration is quite low.

Without explicit prior probabilities for each field, let's assume a simplistic model where the likelihood of enrolling in any given field is roughly equal, but factor in deviations given the matching of Adam's traits.

Based on the rough match:

- P(B|Business Administration) can be considered low.
- P(B) remains as a sum of P(B|Fields) across all possible fields.

Assigning reasonable qualitative probabilities, let's assume:
- \( P(B | \text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(B | \text{More aligned field e.g., Biology}) \approx 0.4 \)
- Uniform assumption for the prior \( P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.1 \), with similar formats for other fields.

With rough normalization:
\[ P(B) = 0.1(0.1) + 0.4(\text{Prior of Biology}) + \ldots \]

Given the quality mapping and practical constraints, it pipes

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{BA}) \times P(\text{BA})}{P(B)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{(some configured sum)} \approx 0.1\]
