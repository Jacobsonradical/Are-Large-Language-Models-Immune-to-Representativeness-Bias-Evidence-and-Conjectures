To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to employ Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( A \) (Adam being enrolled in business administration) given the evidence \( B \) (Adam's personality sketch).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( B \) given that hypothesis \( A \) is true.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( A \) (the probability of Adam being a business administration student before seeing the personality sketch).
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( B \).

Given that we don't have precise statistical data, I'll make some general assumptions based on typical characteristics associated with various fields:

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \)**: Assuming all fields are equally likely without additional information, \( P(A) \) might be around 1/10 for business administration, given that there are roughly 10 major fields of graduate study.
2. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**: Given Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, high intelligence, appreciation for hard work), these traits don't strongly align with typical traits for business administration students. Business fields usually prioritize traits like leadership, financial acuity, and strategic thinking.
3. **Marginal likelihood \( P(B) \)**: Considering Adam's personality traits, they seem to align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Hence, the marginal probability of observing these traits across all fields would be relatively high.

Now, given the subjective evaluation:
- \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \).
- If \( P(B|A) \) (likelihood for business administration) is very low (let's assume 0.1).
- Prior \( P(A) \) is about 0.1.
- Marginal \( P(B) \) is relatively high (let's assume 0.4 as Adam's traits are common in more fields).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{0.4} = \frac{0.01}{0.4} = 0.025 \]

This is an estimation, not a precise calculation. Given the assumptions, Adam's probability of being in business administration is relatively low.
