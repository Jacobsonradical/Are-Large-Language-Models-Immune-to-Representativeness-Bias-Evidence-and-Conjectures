To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we'll use the following steps under the Bayesian framework:

1. Define the Prior Probability \( P(B) \):
   - This is the initial probability of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration.

2. Define the Likelihood \( P(S \mid B) \):
   - This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that the student is enrolled in business administration.

3. Define the Evidence \( P(S) \):
   - This is the total probability of observing the personality sketch across all fields.

4. Define the Conditional Probability \( P(B \mid S) \):
   - This is what we want to compute: the probability of being enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch.

However, without precise numerical data on the prior probabilities for each field and empirical likelihoods, we can only provide a qualitative estimate based on the given information.

Let’s make a qualitative assessment and use some assumed numerical estimates.

- **Prior Probability \( P(B) \)**: Let’s assume there’s an equal chance among several popular fields in graduate studies (e.g., business, biology, computer science, etc.). If there are 5 major fields, then \( P(B) = 0.2 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(S \mid B) \)**: Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems more inclined towards fields related to nature, puzzles, and empathy (e.g., biology, psychology). The likelihood of this personality sketch matching someone in business administration might be lower. Assume \( P(S \mid B) = 0.1 \).

- **Evidence \( P(S) \)**: This is a normalizing constant. For simplicity, we will estimate it as the sum of the probabilities of observing the sketch over the possible fields. Assume there are 5 fields and the probability for Adam's personality sketch approximating to a graduate student is higher in fields related to nature and puzzles. So let's average it as \( P(S) = (0.1 + 0.4 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.1) / 5 = 0.2 \).

Now we can calculate using Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(B \mid S) = \frac{P(S \mid B) \cdot P(B)}{P(S)} \]

\[ P(B \mid S) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} = 0.1 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability estimate for Adam being enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is 0.1.
