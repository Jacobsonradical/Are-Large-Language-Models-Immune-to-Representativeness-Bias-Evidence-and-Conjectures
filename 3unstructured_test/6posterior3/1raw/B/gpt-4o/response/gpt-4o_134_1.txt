To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we would ideally need more specifics about the base rate of students in business administration and the likelihood of individuals with Adam's personality traits enrolling in business administration.

However, I can provide a qualitative assessment based on the information we have:

Given Adam's described traits—a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoyment in solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication—his interests and personality align more closely with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration.

Thus, the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration can be qualitatively assumed to be low. Although without precise numerical data, this remains an estimation. For illustrative purposes, I will assign a low probability value to this assessment:
