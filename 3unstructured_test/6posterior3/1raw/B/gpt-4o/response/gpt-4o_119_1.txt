  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, a field like business administration is less likely compared to fields that align more directly with his described interests and traits, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. His curiosity about nature, empathy, and puzzle-solving abilities suggest he might be more inclined toward scientific or analytical fields rather than business administration. Therefore, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is lower.
