To compute the posterior conditional probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to take into account the likelihood that his interests and personality match the typical characteristics of someone studying business administration. Generally, business administration programs attract individuals who are interested in management, economics, and organizational behavior. These fields often require strong analytical skills, leadership, and a focus on financial and operational efficiency.

Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and his enjoyment of solving puzzles, these characteristics might more strongly suggest a field related to environmental science, biology, psychology, or perhaps a STEM-related field rather than business administration. However, the understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be aligned with any demanding field, including business administration.

Given that, let's assign a relatively low posterior conditional probability for Adam being enrolled in business administration, since his interests and personality seem more likely to align with other fields.
