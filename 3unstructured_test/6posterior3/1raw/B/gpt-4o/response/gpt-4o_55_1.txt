Given Adam's personality sketch, he appears to be more inclined towards disciplines that involve nature, animals, and abstract conceptsâ€”likely fields such as biology, environmental science, or perhaps even psychology. Business administration, which typically involves strategic management, finance, and operations, doesn't seem to naturally align with his interests and traits. Therefore, the posterior conditional probability that he was enrolled in business administration, based on the given personality traits, is relatively low.
