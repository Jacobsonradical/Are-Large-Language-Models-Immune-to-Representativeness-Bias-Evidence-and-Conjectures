To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of the personality traits given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the personality traits.

Given that specific probabilities are not provided, we need to make some qualitative judgments based on his personality traits and typical academic field characteristics. Here are some considerations:

1. **High Intelligence and Abstract Concepts**: These traits are valuable in many fields including business administration.
2. **Curiosity About Nature and Love for Animals**: These traits are more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies rather than business administration.
3. **Quiet and Enjoy Solving Puzzles**: These traits are more neutral but might lean towards fields involving detailed qualitative/quantitative analysis.

Given these points:
- The traits like empathy, love for nature, and animals are less associated with business administration.
- The high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts can be relevant, but they are not decisive.

Thus, the likelihood of Adam being in business administration based on these traits would be relatively low. Without exact figures, I will provide a qualitative estimate.

  "business administration": "0.2" // This is a hypothetical value to represent the relatively low probability.
