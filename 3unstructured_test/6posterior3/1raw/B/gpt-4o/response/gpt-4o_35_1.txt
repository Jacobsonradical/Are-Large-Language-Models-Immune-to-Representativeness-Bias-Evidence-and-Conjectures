To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics align with the typical attributes and interests of someone in a business administration program.

Based on the provided personality sketch:
- Adam has a strong curiosity about nature and plants, which is more aligned with fields like biology or environmental science rather than business administration.
- He enjoys solving puzzles, indicating a logical or analytical mindset, which could fit business administration to some extent.
- He possesses a high level of empathy and love for animals, which is less directly relevant to business administration.
- His appreciation for hard work and dedication can be a trait found in any field, including business administration.
- Abstract thinking is crucial in many fields, including business administration, but the emphasis on empathy, nature, and animals suggests a different focus.

Given these points, Adam's personality seems less aligned with the typical interests and traits of a business administration student.
