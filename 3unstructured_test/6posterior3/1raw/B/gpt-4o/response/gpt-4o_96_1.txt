Given Adam's personality sketch, it's essential to consider how well his characteristics align with typical traits and interests associated with graduate programs in different fields. For business administration, typical traits might include strategic thinking, leadership, interest in finance and economics, and a focus on organizational efficiency and entrepreneurship. 

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and inclination towards solving puzzles seem more aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or other sciences rather than business administration. Thus, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given his personality sketch, is likely low.
