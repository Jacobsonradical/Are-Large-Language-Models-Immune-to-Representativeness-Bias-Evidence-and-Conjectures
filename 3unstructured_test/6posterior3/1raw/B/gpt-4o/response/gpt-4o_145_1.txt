To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to make use of Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can only give a qualitative estimate based on the described characteristics and the general alignment with what might be typical for a business administration field.

Adam's personality sketch highlights several traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits are more typically associated with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or perhaps education rather than business administration, which often emphasizes strategic thinking, financial acumen, and leadership.

Given these considerations, we can infer that the probability Adam was enrolled in business administration, given his described traits, is lower.

This is a reasoned estimate recognizing the possibility but suggesting it is less likely given the described personality and interests.
