To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch (B).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

However, without specific numerical values or a dataset detailing the priors (\( P(A) \)) and the likelihood (\( P(B|A) \)), it is challenging to provide an exact value. Instead, I will provide a qualitative assessment based on typical characteristics.

Adam's deep curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence in abstract concepts, and strong empathy suggest a higher likelihood of being in a field related to natural sciences, environmental studies, or a similar area rather than business administration. Therefore, the conditional probability is likely to be relatively low.

This estimate is based on the assumption that Adam's personality and interests align more closely with fields other than business administration.
