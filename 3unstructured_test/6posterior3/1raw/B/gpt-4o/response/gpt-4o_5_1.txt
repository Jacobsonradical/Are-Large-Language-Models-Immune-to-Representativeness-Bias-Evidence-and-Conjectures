To compute the posterior conditional probability, we need to consider both the personality sketch of Adam and prior information about typical characteristics of students in various fields, including business administration.

Adam's described traits (curiosity about nature and plants, enjoyment of puzzles, empathy and love for animals, and high intelligence in abstract concepts) align more closely with fields like natural sciences, biology, environmental studies, or psychology rather than business administration. Typical business administration students are often characterized by attributes such as a strong interest in leadership, finance, entrepreneurship, and strategic management.

Given this information, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, considering his personality sketch, should be relatively low.
