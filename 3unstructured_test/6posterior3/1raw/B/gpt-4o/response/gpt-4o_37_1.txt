  "business administration": "0.2"
}

This estimate is based on the fact that business administration typically appeals to individuals who are more oriented towards leadership, management, and organizational skills rather than those with a deep love for animals, nature, and abstract concepts. While it is not impossible for a person with Adam's personality traits to pursue business administration, it is less likely compared to fields more directly related to his interests, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. Therefore, the probability is on the lower side.
