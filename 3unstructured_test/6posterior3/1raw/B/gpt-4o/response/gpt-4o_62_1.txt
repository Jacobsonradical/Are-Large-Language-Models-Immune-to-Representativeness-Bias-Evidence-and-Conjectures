  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy, it is more likely that he would be found in a field related to the natural sciences, biology, or environmental science rather than business administration. While it is not impossible for someone with his traits to be in business administration, the probability is relatively lower compared to fields directly aligning with his interests and personality traits. Therefore, we estimate a lower posterior conditional probability for business administration.
