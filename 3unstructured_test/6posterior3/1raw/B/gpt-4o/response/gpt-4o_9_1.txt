To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider several pieces of information:

1. Information provided in the personality sketch about Adam’s traits and interests.
2. General knowledge about the traits and interests typically associated with business administration students.
3. Bayes' theorem, which helps in updating the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Given Adam's qualities:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- A quiet personality who enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm-heartedness, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Now, consider the prototypical traits of someone studying business administration:
- Interest in business concepts, finance, management.
- Often more extroverted or sociable to build networks.
- Ambition towards leadership roles.
- Strategic thinking, often less focused on pure nature and more on human-centered enterprises.

Comparing these traits, Adam's personality sketch aligns less closely with the typical profile for business administration students. However, it's not impossible since personalities vary widely, and business administration students can also have diverse interests and skills.

Given this reasoning, let's assign a low posterior probability because Adam’s interests and personality traits do not strongly align with what one would expect for a business administration student.

Using a subjective estimate based on the mismatches noted:

  "business administration": 0.1
