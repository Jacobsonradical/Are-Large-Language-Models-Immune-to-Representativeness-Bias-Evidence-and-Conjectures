To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Generally, Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.

However, without specific data on the probabilities involved in these fields, I can only provide a qualitative inference based on Adam's personality traits.

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and quiet nature with a tendency to solve puzzles suggest that he might be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps even psychology rather than business administration. His strong empathy and appreciation for hard work might not necessarily align with the typical traits sought in business administration, which often focuses more on leadership, management, and perhaps more extroverted interpersonal skills.

Nevertheless, this qualitative assessment doesn't provide exact numerical probabilities.

Given this qualitative analysis, I'll estimate that the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in business administration is relatively low.

  "business administration": 0.2

This estimate reflects the intuition that Adam's described personality traits are less aligned with the typical profile of a business administration student.
