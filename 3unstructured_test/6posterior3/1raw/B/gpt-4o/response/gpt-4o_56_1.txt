To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider several factors. 

Adamâ€™s personality traits such as genuine curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, being quiet, enjoying puzzles, empathy, and intelligence lean more toward fields related to natural sciences, environmental studies, psychology, or similar areas. Business administration, on the other hand, does not align closely with these traits.

Without specific prior probability distributions and likelihoods, we must make a qualitative assessment based on the given personality traits.

Qualitatively, the traits described do not strongly suggest a field like business administration. Hence, the posterior probability would be relatively low.
