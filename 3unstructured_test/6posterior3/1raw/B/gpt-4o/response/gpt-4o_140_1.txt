{
  "business administration": 0.1
}

In this case, Adam's personality sketch suggests strong traits that are more aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration. While it is not impossible for someone with his personality traits to be in business administration, the probability is likely lower due to the nature of his interests and personality characteristics. Therefore, a value of 0.1 reflects this lower probability.
