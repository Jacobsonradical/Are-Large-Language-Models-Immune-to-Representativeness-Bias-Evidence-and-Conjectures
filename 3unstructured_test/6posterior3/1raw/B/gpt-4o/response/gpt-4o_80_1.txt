To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the likelihood of Adam’s personality traits given that he's enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that anyone is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Adam’s personality traits.

Given that we lack precise numerical data to fill in these probabilities exactly, we will have to make some educated guesses based on qualitative reasoning. 

1. **P(B | A)**: The likelihood of Adam’s personality traits given that he's enrolled in business administration. Typically, business administration students might be expected to have different traits, such as leadership, strategic thinking, and an interest in economics, finance, or operations rather than a strong enthusiasm for nature and animals. Let’s assume a lower likelihood, around 0.2.

2. **P(A)**: The prior probability of being enrolled in business administration. If we assume business administration is one of the more common graduate fields, we can estimate it generously at around 0.15 (15%).

3. **P(B)**: The probability of Adam's personality traits in general. Knowing Adam’s traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, etc.), we might assume that such a personality is uncommon in business administration programs, compared to, say, environmental sciences or biology. Estimating this is tricky, but let's put it at about 0.1.

Using these estimates:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.15}{0.1} = 0.3 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability, roughly estimated, that Adam is enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is:

  "business administration": 0.3
