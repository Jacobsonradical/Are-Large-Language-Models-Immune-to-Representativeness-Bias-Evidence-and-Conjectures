To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to formulate an understanding of how well his characteristics align with a typical profile of a business administration student.

Let's break down Adam's traits and see how they might align with the typical characteristics of someone in business administration:

1. **Curiosity about nature and plants**: This trait aligns more with fields like environmental science or biology rather than business administration.
2. **Quiet demeanor**: While being quiet doesn't exclude someone from business administration, it's generally a field that can favor more extroverted and assertive qualities.
3. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This trait can be an advantage in business administration, as problem-solving is an important skill.
4. **Warm heart and strong empathy**: These are beneficial traits but are not typically highlighted as key characteristics in business administration.
5. **Deep love for animals**: This suggests a possible inclination towards biology, veterinary studies, or environmental sciences.
6. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: This is favorable for business administration, as it involves strategic thinking and planning.
7. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This is a positive trait across many fields, including business administration.

Given these points, we see that some of Adam's traits could align with business administration (problem-solving, intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, appreciation for hard work), but many others point towards more nature-oriented fields.

Considering this analysis, it is reasonable to estimate the posterior conditional probability but acknowledge that many personality traits align more strongly with fields other than business administration.

Based on this, I would provide an estimated value for the posterior conditional probability:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

This estimate reflects the consideration that while some traits align, many others suggest he might be more suited to other fields such as environmental science or biology.
