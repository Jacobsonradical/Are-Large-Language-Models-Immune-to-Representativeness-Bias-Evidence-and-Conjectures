To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of business administration given his personality sketch, we'll need to consider how closely his attributes and interests align with typical characteristics and motivations of business administration students.

Based on Adam's personality sketch:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

These traits suggest someone who might be more inclined towards fields that involve nature, scientific inquiry, or problem-solving, rather than fields focused primarily on administration and business. While business administration students can certainly possess these traits, Adam's specific interests and strengths seem more aligned with fields like environmental science, biology, or perhaps even engineering.

Nonetheless, without definitive statistical data and based on the qualitative assessment alone, the probability of Adam being in business administration is likely lower than in a more directly related field.

Applying a Bayesian reasoning approach contextually (albeit qualitatively), we can thus estimate a reasonable posterior probability for business administration.
