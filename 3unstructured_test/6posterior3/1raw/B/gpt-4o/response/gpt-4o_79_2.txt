  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, traits like a deep love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, high intelligence, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is less likely for him to be enrolled in a field like business administration. More plausible fields might include environmental science, biology, psychology, or similar areas that align with his interests and personality. Hence, the probability for business administration is low.
