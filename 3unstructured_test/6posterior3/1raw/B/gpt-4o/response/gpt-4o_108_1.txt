Given Adam's personality sketch, we need to evaluate how well his characteristics align with the field of business administration and use it to determine the posterior conditional probability.

Here are the considerations based on Adam's personality sketch:
1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. He enjoys solving puzzles.
3. He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
4. He has high intelligence and understands abstract concepts.
5. He appreciates hard work and dedication.

For business administration:
- A strong interest in nature and plants doesn't align strongly with business administration.
- Enjoying solving puzzles might be somewhat relevant as business problems often require creative and analytical solutions.
- A warm heart and strong empathy could be beneficial in management and human resources but are not the primary traits sought in business administration.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts can certainly be valuable.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant and desirable.

Considering these aspects, the alignment of his personality characteristics with business administration is moderate but not strong. Therefore, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch would likely be relatively low.
