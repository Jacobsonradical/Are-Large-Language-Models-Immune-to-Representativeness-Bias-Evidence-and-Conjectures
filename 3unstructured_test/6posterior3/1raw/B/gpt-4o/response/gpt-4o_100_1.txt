  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, it is unlikely that his traits align closely with those typically associated with business administration. His interests in nature, empathy, love for animals, and puzzle-solving are more indicative of fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology, rather than business administration. Therefore, the posterior probability is low.
