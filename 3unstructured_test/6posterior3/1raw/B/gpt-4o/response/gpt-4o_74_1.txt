To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics align with typical traits and interests of business administration students. We can apply Bayes' Theorem for this purpose.

However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods for each possible field, we can only make a reasoned, qualitative assessment. We'll base this on the general knowledge about the match between Adam's attributes and the common characteristics of business administration students.

Business administration often involves a combination of quantitative skills, leadership, communication, and an interest in organizational operations and management. Although Adam's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be relevant, the specifics of his personality—curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for dedication—do not strongly align with typical traits necessary or common in business administration.

Thus, the probability might be on the lower end. Here is the quantified estimate:

  "business administration": 0.2
