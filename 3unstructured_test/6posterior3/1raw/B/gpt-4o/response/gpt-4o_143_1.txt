To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. However, it's important to note that we lack the explicit prior and likelihood probabilities needed to compute this precisely. Instead, we can make an informed estimate based on typical trends and assumptions:

Given Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits might be more aligned with fields such as environmental science, biology, psychology, or other life sciences rather than business administration, which typically emphasizes different skills and interests such as strategic thinking, finance, marketing, and management.

Given these observations, the posterior probability might be fairly low. Keeping this qualitative assessment in mind, a reasonable estimate might be:

{
  "business administration": 0.1
}
