  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have a strong inclination towards nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which aligns more with fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology rather than business administration. While it's not impossible for someone with these traits to be in business administration, the probability is lower due to the mismatch in interests and inclinations. Hence, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low.
