To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider the alignment between his characteristics and the typical traits or requirements for success in business administration.

From the personality sketch:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Assessing how these characteristics map onto a typical profile for a business administration student:

- Curiosity about nature and plants: Not typically aligned with business administration.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Somewhat aligned; problem-solving is relevant in business, but not a primary focus.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals: Not particularly aligned; business often requires a pragmatic approach rather than an empathetic one.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Aligned; necessary for strategic thinking and management.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Aligned; essential for success in any field, including business administration.

Overall, while some traits such as intelligence and appreciation for hard work align with business administration, many of Adam's interests and characteristics (like empathy and love for nature) lean towards fields more connected to environmental science, biology, or psychology.

Given these considerations, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low.

Therefore, the probability can be estimated as follows:
