  "business administration": 0.1
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a field like business administration, which may not align as well with his pronounced interests in nature, animals, and solving puzzles. It is more plausible for him to be in a field such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology. Thus, the posterior probability for business administration is relatively low.
