To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we generally need prior probability data and conditional probability data. However, since we don't have specific priors or the exact probability distribution over possible fields of study for Adam, we'll make a subjective assessment based on the information given in his personality sketch and some reasonable assumptions.

Given the information about Adam:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals**.
4. **High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts**.
5. **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**.

These traits suggest an inclination towards fields such as environmental science, biology, psychology, or areas related to animal care. Business administration usually involves a different type of skill set and interests, such as leadership, financial acuity, and organizational behavior, which don't appear to be highlighted in Adam's personality sketch. 

While it's certainly possible for someone with Adam's traits to be in business administration, given our knowledge of his interests and characteristics, it seems less likely.

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration might reasonably be considered low.

Based on this qualitative analysis, a reasonable value might be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

This is a subjective estimate based on the information provided and could be numerically adjusted if more specific probability data were available.
