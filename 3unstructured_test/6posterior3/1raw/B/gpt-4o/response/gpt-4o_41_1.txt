To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(\text{Business Administration} \mid \text{Personality Sketch}) \), we need to consider how likely someone with Adam's personality traits would be enrolled in Business Administration. Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has a strong empathy, loves animals, and has high intelligence geared towards understanding abstract concepts, it fits less directly with the typical traits associated with business administration which often emphasize strategic thinking, decision making, leadership, and human interaction dynamics.

While Business Administration is broad and can accommodate various personalities, Adam's traits suggest a stronger alignment with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or perhaps even a STEM-related field rather than business.

Based on this analysis, the posterior conditional probability can be considered relatively low:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1
}
``` 

This value reflects a small but not non-existent likelihood, given that Adam's traits are not the most indicative of someone pursuing Business Administration.
