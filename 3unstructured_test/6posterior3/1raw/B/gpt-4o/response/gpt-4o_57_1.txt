  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, which includes a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, a love for animals, interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and empathy, it is less likely that he would choose a field like business administration. His interests and personality traits are more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, rather than a business-oriented field. The provided value of 0.1 reflects this lower probability.
