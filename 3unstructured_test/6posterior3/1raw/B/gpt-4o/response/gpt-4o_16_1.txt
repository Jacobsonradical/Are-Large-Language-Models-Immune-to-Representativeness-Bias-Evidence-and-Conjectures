To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, we need to consider how well his personality traits and interests align with a typical business administration student.

Given the personality sketch:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants:** This trait is more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or botany, rather than business administration.
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles:** While problem-solving is important in business, the quiet nature might be more suited to fields with less interaction, such as research-oriented fields (e.g., mathematics, computer science).
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals:** These traits are often linked to fields like veterinary science, psychology, or social work.
4. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts:** This could apply to many fields, but disciplines such as mathematics, physics, or philosophy often require a strong grasp of abstract concepts.
5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** This is a trait that is beneficial in any field, including business administration.

Considering these points, while some traits like problem-solving and appreciation for hard work match, other core characteristics such as curiosity about nature and love for animals do not strongly align with business administration. Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration based on this personality sketch feels lower.

Let's assign a subjective probability, taking into account that these are rational assessments but not definitive calculations:

  "business administration": 0.2
