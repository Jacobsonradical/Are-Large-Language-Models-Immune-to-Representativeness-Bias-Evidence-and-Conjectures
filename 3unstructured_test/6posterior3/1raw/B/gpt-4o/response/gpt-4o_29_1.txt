To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch involves using Bayesian inference. However, since we don't have prior probabilities or the likelihood functions explicitly defined, we'll make a qualitative assessment based on the provided information.

**Adam's Characteristics:**
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm-hearted, empathetic, and loves animals.
4. High intelligence and good at abstract concepts.
5. Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
6. Graduate student in 2021.

**Field of Business Administration:**
Typically, students in Business Administration may have a keen interest in economics, management, finance, marketing, and strategic decision-making. While it requires intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts, it might not directly align with Adam's strong interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, which seem more oriented towards fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology.

Given Adam's personality sketch and interests, it appears less likely that he would be enrolled in Business Administration. While it is not impossible, his profile suggests leaning more towards fields associated with nature, puzzle-solving, empathy, and animals.

Hence, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration is likely to be low.
