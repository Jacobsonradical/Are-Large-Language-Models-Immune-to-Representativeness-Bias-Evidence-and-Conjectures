Given Adam's personality traits and interests, it's unlikely that he was enrolled in a business administration program. Instead, his love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles suggests he may be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or even mathematics. His empathy and warm heart would also make him suited to fields that involve working with living beings or require a deep understanding of ethical considerations. His strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit into many fields, but given the specific traits described, business administration doesn't seem to align as closely with his personality.
