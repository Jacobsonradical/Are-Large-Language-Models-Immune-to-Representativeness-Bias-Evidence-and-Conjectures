To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider both his personality traits and typical characteristics of students in that field.

**Adamâ€™s Personality Traits:**
- Genuine curiosity about nature
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted and empathetic
- Loves animals
- High intelligence and good at abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

**Typical Traits and Interests for Business Administration Students:**
- Interest in entrepreneurship, finance, management
- Leadership skills, communication skills
- Teamwork and collaboration
- Networking and social skills
- Understanding of business operations and market strategies

Given the scarcity of information in Adam's personality sketch that aligns directly with the typical interests and skills required for business administration, it suggests a lower probability that this is his field of study. On the other hand, Adam's love for nature and animals, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and high intelligence with a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work are traits that don't strongly overlap with business-related studies.

Based on this reasoning, and without concrete numerical data but using an informed judgment approach, we can estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
