To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration given his personality sketch, we need to make some subjective decisions based on the description provided. Specifically, we need to consider whether the characteristics mentioned align with the profile of a typical business administration student.

The personality sketch highlights the following key traits about Adam:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted with strong empathy and love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's evaluate how these characteristics align with someone likely to enroll in business administration:

1. **Interest in Nature and Plants**: This trait more closely aligns with fields like biology, environmental science, or agriculture rather than business administration.
2. **Solving Puzzles**: While problem-solving skills are valuable, this trait is more associated with fields like mathematics, computer science, or engineering.
3. **Empathy and Love for Animals**: This trait could be relevant for careers in veterinary science, psychology, or social work, but is less central to business administration.
4. **High Intelligence and Understanding of Abstract Concepts**: This is applicable in many fields, including business administration.
5. **Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication**: This is a universal trait that can be applied to any field.

Although some traits like intelligence and work ethic are universally valuable and could be associated with business administration, the specific interests in nature, puzzles, and animals suggest a lower likelihood for business administration compared to fields more directly related to these interests.

Considering these points:

Given Adam's personality and interests, there is a probability of 0.2 or 20% that he was enrolled in business administration. This reflects that while certain traits align with the field, his specific interests suggest a stronger inclination toward other fields.
