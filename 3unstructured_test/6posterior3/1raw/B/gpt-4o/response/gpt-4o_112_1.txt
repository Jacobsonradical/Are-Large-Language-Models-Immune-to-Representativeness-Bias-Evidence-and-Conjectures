  "business administration": 0.2

Given Adam's personality sketch, several aspects of his profile suggest he might be less likely to enroll in business administration. Business administration often rewards skills in leadership, finance, and strategic planning, whereas Adamâ€™s interests and strengths lie more in nature, puzzles, empathy, animals, and abstract concepts. On the other hand, since he shows a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, there's a small chance he could have enrolled in a field that values these traits, such as business administration. Therefore, I'd assign a lower probability to him being in that field.
