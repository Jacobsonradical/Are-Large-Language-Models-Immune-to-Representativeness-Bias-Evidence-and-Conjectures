To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we would typically use Bayes' Theorem, which requires prior probabilities and likelihoods based on personality traits for different fields of study. However, in this context, we don’t have specific numerical prior probabilities and likelihoods, so we need to make a qualitative assessment instead.

Let's qualitatively analyze the fit of Adam's personality traits with business administration:

1. **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Not typically aligned with business administration.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Can be a useful trait, but not specifically indicative of business administration.
3. **Warm heart and strong empathy**: These traits can be useful in fields like human resources or management within business administration, but they are not central to the field.
4. **Deep love for animals**: Not typically aligned with business administration.
5. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: This might help in areas of business, such as strategy or analytics, but it’s a broad trait that fits many fields.
6. **Strong understanding and appreciation for the hard work and dedication**: This trait is valuable but also broadly applicable to many areas of study.

Given Adam's strong inclination towards nature, animals, and empathy, these traits might fit better with fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary science, or psychology rather than business administration. Therefore, we can infer that the likelihood of Adam being in business administration, given his personality sketch, is relatively low.

Therefore, qualitatively estimating based on the above analysis:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

This value represents a low probability reflecting the lesser alignment of Adam's personality traits with the typical profile for a graduate student in business administration.
