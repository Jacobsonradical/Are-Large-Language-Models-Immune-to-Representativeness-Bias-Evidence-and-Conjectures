Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely that he would have been enrolled in business administration due to the following factors:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals suggests more of a leaning towards biological sciences or environmental studies.
2. High intelligence and adeptness in understanding abstract concepts align more with fields requiring deep analytical skills, like sciences, engineering, or philosophy.
3. Enjoyment of solving puzzles might indicate a propensity for fields like mathematics, computer science, or natural sciences.
4. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals further suggest a connection with fields that involve caring for living beings, such as veterinary sciences, biology, or conservation studies.

These characteristics are less indicative of a typical business administration student. Hence, the probability is assessed quite low.
