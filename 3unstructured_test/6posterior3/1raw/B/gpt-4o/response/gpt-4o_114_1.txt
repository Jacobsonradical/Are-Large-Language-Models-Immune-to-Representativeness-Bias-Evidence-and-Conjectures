To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider the alignment of Adam's characteristics with the traits typically beneficial or essential for studying in that field. 

Business administration often requires skills and interests such as leadership, management, strategic thinking, and a focus on business-related subjects such as finance, marketing, and economics. While Adam's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts might fit well, the other aspects of his personality sketch do not align as closely. He shows a strong connection to nature, animals, empathy, and puzzles, which are typically more associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration.

Given the above consideration, the conditional probability, P(Business Administration | Adam's Personality):

{
  "business administration": 0.1
