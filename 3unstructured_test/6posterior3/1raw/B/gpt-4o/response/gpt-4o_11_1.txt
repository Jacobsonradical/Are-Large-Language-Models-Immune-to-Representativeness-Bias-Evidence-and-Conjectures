To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider the match between his personality characteristics and the typical qualities valued in business administration programs.

Given Adam's profile:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
5. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

In business administration, qualities such as leadership, strategic thinking, people management, and commercial acumen are typically valued. While Adam possesses high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and dedication, his deep empathy and love for nature and animals may be less aligned with a conventional business administration profile.

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality might be relatively low. Based on these considerations, a reasonable estimated value might be around 0.1.
