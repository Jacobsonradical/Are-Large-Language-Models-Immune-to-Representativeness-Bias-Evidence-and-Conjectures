To compute the posterior conditional probability, we need to consider Adam's personality traits and interests in relation to the field of business administration. Based on the description, Adam's interests and traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles, empathy, high intelligence, appreciation for hard work) do not strongly align with typical qualities associated with business administration students, such as a focus on commerce, management, finance, and organizational skills.

Given the discrepancy between Adam's personality and the typical characteristics of a business administration student, the posterior probability that he was enrolled in business administration is likely to be low. Let's assume a qualitative assessment to compute this value.
