  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles, it seems less likely that Adam would choose a field like business administration compared to something more directly aligned with his interests. However, it's not impossible, as people can have varied interests and could apply their skills in diverse fields. Therefore, I assigned a relatively low probability (0.1) to reflect this.
