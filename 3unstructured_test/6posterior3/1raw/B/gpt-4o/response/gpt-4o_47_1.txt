To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider the likelihood of someone with Adam's traits being enrolled in this field.

Given Adam's characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits do not strongly align with typical attributes associated with business administration students, who might be more extroverted, commercially driven, and interested in leadership, management, and finance.

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration, given his personality sketch, seems low. A reasonable estimate might be:

{
  "business administration": 0.1
}
