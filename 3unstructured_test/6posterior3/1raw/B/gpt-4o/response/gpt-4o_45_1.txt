  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts suggest he is more likely to be in a field related to science, nature, or social sciences than business administration. However, it isn't entirely impossible for someone with these traits to be in business administration, just less probable. Therefore, I estimate the posterior conditional probability to be around 0.1.
