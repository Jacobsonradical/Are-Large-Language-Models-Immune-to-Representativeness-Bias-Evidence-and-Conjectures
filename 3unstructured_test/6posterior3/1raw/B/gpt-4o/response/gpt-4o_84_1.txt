In order to compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits align with the typical traits of someone studying business administration. Adam's traits include:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
2. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
3. Warm-hearted with strong empathy
4. Deep love for animals
5. High intelligence and good with abstract concepts
6. Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Given these traits, let's evaluate how they correlate with the field of business administration:

1. Curiosity about nature and plants is not particularly relevant to business administration.
2. Enjoying solving puzzles might be somewhat relevant, as problem-solving can be an essential skill.
3. Warm-hearted with strong empathy can be useful in management and HR roles.
4. Love for animals is generally not relevant.
5. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are useful in any field, including business administration.
6. Appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant and important in business administration.

While there are some connections, many of Adam's traits are more indicative of a person interested in fields such as natural sciences, psychology, or animal sciences. Therefore, it is less likely that he would be in business administration as opposed to these other fields.

Based on this consideration, we can estimate a lower posterior conditional probability for him being enrolled in business administration.

This is a subjective estimation considering the general fit of Adam's personality with the characteristics often associated with a business administration student.
