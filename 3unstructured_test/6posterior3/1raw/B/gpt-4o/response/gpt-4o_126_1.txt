To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we would ideally need a Bayesian framework or some historical data that provides the probability distribution of students enrolled in different fields based on their personality traits.

Since we don't have specific probabilistic data, we can only make an approximate assessment based on the information provided.

Adam has a personality characterized by a curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work. These traits seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration.

Based on these traits, one could infer that the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low. Let's use a subjective estimate:

- Business administration often aligns with personality traits like leadership, interest in economic systems, strategic thinking, and managementâ€”not primarily those that Adam exhibits.

Given this reasoning, an approximate posterior probability can be computed.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

This represents a subjective estimate and should ideally be refined with actual probabilistic data and more context about Adam's educational environment and choices.
