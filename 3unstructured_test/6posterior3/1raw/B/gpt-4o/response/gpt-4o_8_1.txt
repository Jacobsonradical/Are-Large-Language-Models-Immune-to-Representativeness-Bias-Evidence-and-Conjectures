{
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation: Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems more inclined towards fields related to nature, animals, and possibly the sciences due to his curiosity about nature and high understanding of abstract concepts. His empathy and love for animals may direct him to fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Business administration does not immediately align with these traits. Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is comparatively low. Hence, 0.1 could be a reasonable estimate.
