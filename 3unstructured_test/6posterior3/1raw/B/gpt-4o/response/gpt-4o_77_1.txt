  "business administration": 0.2
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, including his curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence with an inclination towards abstract concepts, business administration does not seem to be the most likely field for him. However, it's still possible he could be in a business administration program, given the broad applications of business knowledge. As a result, I estimate the probability at around 0.2.
