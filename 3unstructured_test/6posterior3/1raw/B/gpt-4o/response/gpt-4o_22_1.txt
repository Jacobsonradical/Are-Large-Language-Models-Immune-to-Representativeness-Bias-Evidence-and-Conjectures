Given Adam's personality sketch, his curiosity about nature and plants, enjoyment of solving puzzles, warm-heartedness, empathy, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it's more likely that he would be drawn towards fields such as biology, environmental science, or animal sciences rather than business administration. Hence, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality traits is relatively low.
