  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration. His personality traits suggest a stronger inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, or other natural sciences. While it's not impossible for someone with Adam's personality to be enrolled in business administration, the probability is relatively low. Hence, I have estimated the probability to be around 0.1.
