To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of event A (Adam enrolled in business administration) given event B (Adam's personality sketch).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of event B given event A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event A.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of event B.

We need to make some reasonable assumptions or have some background knowledge to estimate these probabilities.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**: Assuming that the distribution of students among various fields is approximately equal, let's assume the prior probability of enrolling in any specific field (including business administration) is around 0.1 for simplicity, as there are many fields of study.

2. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**: We need to estimate how likely Adam's personality sketch is if he were a business administration student. Business administration students typically need to be analytical and have good problem-solving skills, but empathy, a warm heart, and a deep love for animals are traits less commonly emphasized in this field.
    
    Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, it's less likely that he fits the typical business administration student profile. Let's assign this a low probability, say 0.01.

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(B) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields of study. Since Adam's traits seem highly specific and less common among business students, let's assume P(B) to be 0.05, covering the uniqueness of his profile across all possible fields.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|\text{personality sketch}) = \frac{P(\text{personality sketch}|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(\text{personality sketch})} \]

\[ = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.1}{0.05} \]

\[ = \frac{0.001}{0.05} \]

\[ = 0.02 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is 0.02.
