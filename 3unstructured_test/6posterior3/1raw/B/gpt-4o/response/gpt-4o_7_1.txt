To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his personality traits align with typical characteristics of students in that field. Let's analyze the match first.

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants**: This suggests a likely interest in fields related to biology, environmental science, botany, or agriculture, rather than business administration.

2. **Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles**: This suggests an analytical mindset, which is useful in many fields but more strongly indicative of areas requiring deep problem-solving, such as mathematics, engineering, or even specific areas within business like analytics or finance.

3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals**: These traits point towards fields that involve caregiving, such as veterinary science, social work, psychology, or biology/ecology focus areas.

4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: This is quite general and can apply to many advanced graduate programs, including business, but combined with other traits, it leans more towards scientific or analytic disciplines.

5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This is again quite general and applies universally across many disciplines, including business.

Given the above factors, Adam's personality traits are not typical for a business administration student. Thus, the posterior probability should figure lower in scale when considering how his described personality fits the likely student profile for business administration.
