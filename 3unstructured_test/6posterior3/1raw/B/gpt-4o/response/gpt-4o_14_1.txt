To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits and interests align with what is commonly associated with students in that field. 

Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence with an inclination for abstract concepts, it appears these traits are more closely aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology than with business administration. Students in business administration often exhibit traits like leadership, strategic thinking, interest in economics or management, and network building, which are not strongly emphasized in Adam's profile.

Since this evaluation is somewhat subjective without quantitative data, we'll approximate the probability based on the qualitative mismatch between Adam's traits and the typical characteristics of a student in business administration.

  "business administration": 0.1

This indicates a relatively low probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the provided personality sketch.
