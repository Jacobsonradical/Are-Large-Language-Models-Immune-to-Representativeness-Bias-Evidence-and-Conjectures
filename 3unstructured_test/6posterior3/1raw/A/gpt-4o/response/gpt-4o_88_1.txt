To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can adopt a Bayesian approach. The detailed personality traits depict specific inclinations that align with the fields related to understanding nature, animals, and empathy.

However, without numerical priors (such as base rates for each field among the population or among graduate students in the U.S.), we'll make informed judgments based on qualitative evidence.

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**: Fields related to nature and plants fit this trait.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This fits with scientific inquiry and can span multiple fields.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals**: This highly aligns with veterinary science.
4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: This fits well with any rigorous graduate program, including agricultural and veterinary sciences.
5. **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This is common in all rigorous fields including agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Given these considerations and the alignment of Adam's traits with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, our qualitative judgment will be reflected in the probability value.

This value reflects a high probability given the strong alignment of Adam's personality traits with the field's demands and characteristics.
