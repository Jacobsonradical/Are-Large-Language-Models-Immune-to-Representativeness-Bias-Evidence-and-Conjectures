  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}

Explanation: Given Adam's personality traits — a strong curiosity about nature, a love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication – it is reasonable to infer a high probability that he was enrolled in a field like agricultural and veterinary science, which aligns well with his interests and skills. However, without more specific information, it is challenging to assign an exact probability. Thus, a probabilistic estimate of 0.75 reflects a strong likelihood based on the given traits but also considers the possibility of other fields of study.
