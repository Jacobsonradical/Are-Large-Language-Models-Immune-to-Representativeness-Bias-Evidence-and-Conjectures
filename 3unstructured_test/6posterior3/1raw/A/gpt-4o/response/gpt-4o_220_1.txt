To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to make an assessment based on the provided qualities and details.

Adam's personality sketch includes:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

Considering these traits:
- Curiosity about nature and plants aligns well with agricultural science.
- A deep love for animals aligns well with veterinary science.
- Strong empathy and a warm heart are also important qualities for veterinary science.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts can be applicable in both sciences due to their complex and problem-solving nature.

Given these alignments with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, we assign a reasonably high probability, though exact value computation would normally require more data.

Using general heuristic assessment:
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}

This reflects a high, but not absolute, likelihood that Adam's personality fits with an enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science.
