To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021 given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayesian inference. Bayesian inference combines prior probability with likelihood to form a posterior probability.

However, without detailed numerical data on prior probabilities and likelihood values, we can only give a qualitative assessment based on the provided information.

To formulate our assessment:
1. **Prior Probability (P(agricultural and veterinary science))**: Typically, this would be the proportion of graduate students in this field, but since we don't have this data, we'll assume it's moderate.
   
2. **Likelihood (P(personality sketch | agricultural and veterinary science))**: This would be high because Adam's personality traits align well with those often found in this field:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
   - Love for animals
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication

3. **Posterior Probability (P(agricultural and veterinary science | personality sketch))**: Given the alignment mentioned above, we expect Adam's likelihood to be relatively high.

Combining these qualitative assessments leads us to conclude a high posterior probability. 

Thus, within the bounds of the given context:
