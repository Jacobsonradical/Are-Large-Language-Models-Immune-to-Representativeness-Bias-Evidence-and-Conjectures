To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we would typically use Bayes' theorem. However, without specific values for prior probabilities and likelihoods, we must rely on qualitative assessment based on the provided information.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, his deep love for animals, and strong empathy, it is reasonable to infer a substantial alignment with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Moreover, his appreciation for hard work aligns with the rigorous nature of these fields. Though we can't compute an exact numerical probability without additional data, we can provide a reasoned estimate.
