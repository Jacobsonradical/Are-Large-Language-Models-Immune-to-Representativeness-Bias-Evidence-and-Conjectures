To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, we'll make an intuitive, rather than strictly mathematical, estimate based on the information provided.

1. **Prior Probability:**
   We need to know the base rate (or prior probability) of graduate students who enroll in agricultural and veterinary science in the U.S. Without specific data, let's make a rough estimate. Suppose 5% of graduate students are in this field.

2. **Likelihood:**
   We then consider how well Adam's personality sketch matches the characteristics typical of someone in agricultural and veterinary science:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
   - Love for animals
   - High intelligence
   - Appreciates hard work and dedication
   These traits are highly indicative of someone in the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Let's denote this likelihood as high. For simplicity, let's give it a value of 0.9 (or 90%).

3. **Normalization Constant:**
   This would be the sum of the probabilities of Adam exhibiting these personality traits across all possible fields. Without specific data for all fields, we'll consider those which might fit his profile well, such as biology, environmental science, etc. For simplicity, let's estimate that the total probability of Adam having similar traits in any field is 0.3.

Using these rough estimates in Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(Agricultural|Traits) = \frac{P(Traits|Agricultural) \cdot P(Agricultural)}{P(Traits)} \]
\[ P(Agricultural|Traits) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.3} = \frac{0.045}{0.3} = 0.15 \]

So, the estimated posterior conditional probability is:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.15"
}
