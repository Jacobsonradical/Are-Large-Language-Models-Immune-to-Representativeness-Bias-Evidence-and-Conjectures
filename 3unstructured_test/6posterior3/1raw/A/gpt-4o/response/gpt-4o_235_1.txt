To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, it is necessary to assess how closely Adam's personality traits align with the characteristics beneficial for a career in that field. 

Here are key points from Adam's personality sketch and how they may align:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants.
- Deep love for animals.
- Strong empathy.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits are highly consistent with fields of study in agricultural and veterinary science, as these areas require an appreciation for nature and animals, empathy, intelligence, and dedication. 

Therefore, given this alignment, we can qualitatively estimate a high posterior probability. However, without specific prior probabilities or a formal Bayesian framework for exact calculation, we can only provide a high probabilistic guess. 

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.85"
}

This estimation of 0.85 suggests a strong probability, acknowledging some uncertainty given the natural scope of possible fields a personality like Adam's might also match.
