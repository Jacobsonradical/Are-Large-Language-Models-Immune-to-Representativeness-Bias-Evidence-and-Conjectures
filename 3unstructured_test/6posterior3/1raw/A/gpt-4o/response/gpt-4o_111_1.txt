To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we must use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Given the provided personality sketch of Adam, I'll make some qualitative estimations. These are not precise calculations but are reasoned estimations suitable for this context:

1. **Likelihood \( P(B | A) \) (the probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science):**
   Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work) closely align with typical interests of students in agricultural and veterinary science.
   \[ P(B | A) \approx 0.8 \]

2. **Prior \( P(A) \) (the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science):**
   According to typical distributions across various graduate programs in the U.S., agricultural and veterinary sciences might have a lower enrollment compared to larger fields like business or engineering.
   \[ P(A) \approx 0.05 \] (this is an assumed value as actual distributions can vary)

3. **Marginal \( P(B) \) (the overall probability of observing someone with Adam's personality traits):**
   While individuals with strong empathy and a love for nature and animals span many fields, these characteristics are relatively rare.
   \[ P(B) \approx 0.1 \]

Using these estimates:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.1} = \frac{0.04}{0.1} = 0.4 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is:
