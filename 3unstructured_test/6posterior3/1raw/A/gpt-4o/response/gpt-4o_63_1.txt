To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can rely on Bayes' theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods for each field of study, we have to make a reasonable subjective estimate based on the information available.

Given Adam's characteristics:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoyment in solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, which involves understanding plants, animals, and the complex systems they are part of.

Thus, estimating the probability subjectively and considering his alignment with the mentioned field:
