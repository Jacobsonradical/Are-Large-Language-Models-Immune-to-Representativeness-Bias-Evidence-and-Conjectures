Given Adam's personality sketch, let's evaluate the posterior conditional probability that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. 

Key points:

1. **Genuine Curiosity about Nature and Plants**: This aligns well with fields involving agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **Love for Animals**: Fits well with veterinary science.
3. **Solving Puzzles & High Intelligence**: Indicates a propensity for fields that require critical thinking and problem-solving.
4. **Empathy and Understanding of Hard Work**: Essential traits for dealing with animals and understanding the challenges of agriculture.

When combining these factors, the probability appears to be reasonably high.

Thus, the posterior conditional probability can be estimated as follows:
