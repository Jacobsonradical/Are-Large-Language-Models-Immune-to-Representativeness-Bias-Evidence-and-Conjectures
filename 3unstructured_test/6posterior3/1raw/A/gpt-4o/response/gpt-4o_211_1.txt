To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities or detailed likelihoods, we can only make an educated estimate based on the personality traits described.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, a deep love for animals, and empathy, it seems that agricultural and veterinary science is a good fit for his interests and personality.

Thus, an estimated probability considering these factors might look like this:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
```

This value reflects a high likelihood based on his described traits and interests, though it's important to note that this is a subjective estimate rather than a rigorously computed statistical probability.
