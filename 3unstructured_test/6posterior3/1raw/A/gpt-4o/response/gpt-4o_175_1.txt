To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we should use Bayesian inference. Here's a simplified methodology to approach the problem:

1. **Prior probability (P(Field))**: This is the proportion of graduate students that were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021.
2. **Likelihood (P(Personality|Field))**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **Evidence (P(Personality))**: This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all fields.

However, due to the lack of specific quantitative data, we will make qualitative judgments based on the provided information. 

Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, warm heart, empathy, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work align well with what is typically found in students of agricultural and veterinary science. Students in this field often have a passion for nature, animals, and a strong work ethic.

Assuming a relatively even distribution of students across various fields, but considering the strong alignment of Adam's traits with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, we can estimate a reasonably high posterior probability.

Here's the format with an estimated value based on qualitative reasoning:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This value of 0.7 suggests a reasonably high probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits.
