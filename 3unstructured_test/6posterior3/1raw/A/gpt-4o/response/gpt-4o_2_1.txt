To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we apply the principles of Bayesian reasoning. Specifically, we need to take into account how well Adam's characteristics match the typical traits of students in this field. 

Based on the information:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants**: This aligns well with studying agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **Deep love for animals**: This is highly relevant to veterinary science.
3. **Empathy and warm heart**: Individuals in this field often have a strong sense of empathy, especially those working with animals.
4. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: Useful for any scientific discipline, including agricultural and veterinary science.
5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This trait is essential in any demanding graduate field, particularly in scientific research.

Given Adam's characteristics and their highly relevant application to agricultural and veterinary sciences, a high probability is reasonable. Note that without a specific prior probability distribution for various fields, we make a qualitative judgement based on trait relevance.

Here's a reasonable approximation:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}
```

This represents a high likelihood, though interpreting it precisely would require more data on the general distribution of students' fields given similar personality traits.
