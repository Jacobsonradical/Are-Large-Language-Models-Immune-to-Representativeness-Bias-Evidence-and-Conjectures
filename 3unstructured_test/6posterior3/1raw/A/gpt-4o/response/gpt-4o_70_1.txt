To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits align with what we would typically expect for someone in that field.

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**: High relevance for agricultural science.
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**: Could apply to a variety of fields, including agricultural science.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals**: Highly relevant for veterinary science.
4. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: Useful for graduate-level study in any field, including agricultural and veterinary science.
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Relevant for many fields but also particularly for agricultural and veterinary science requiring practical hands-on work and dedication.

Given this analysis, it's reasonable to infer that Adam's characteristics make him well-suited to the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the posterior probability, while subjective, could be fairly high.
