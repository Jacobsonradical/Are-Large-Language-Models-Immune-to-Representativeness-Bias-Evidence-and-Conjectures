To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian inference. However, without specific statistical data or priors, we'll need to make qualitative assessments based on his described traits and interests.

Based on the sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, which commonly involves working with animals and plants, requiring empathy, dedication, and an understanding of complex concepts.

Therefore, we can reasonably assume that the probability is quite high.
