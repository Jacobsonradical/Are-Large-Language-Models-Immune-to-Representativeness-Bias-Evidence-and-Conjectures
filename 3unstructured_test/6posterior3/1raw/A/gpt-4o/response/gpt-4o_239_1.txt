To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we typically apply Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific data on prior probabilities and likelihoods, we must rely on qualitative assessment. Adam's attributes—such as his curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work—align well with the characteristics desired in agricultural and veterinary science.

Thus, while this is a subjective estimate, we can infer a relatively high probability.
