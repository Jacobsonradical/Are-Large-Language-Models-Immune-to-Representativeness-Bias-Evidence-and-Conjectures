To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits align with someone who would typically be in this field. 

Adam's traits include:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: This can align but is not specific to the field.
- Warm heart, strong empathy: Positively aligns with veterinary science.
- Deep love for animals: Strongly aligns with veterinary science.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: May align but is more general.
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: This general trait is valued in all fields but particularly in ones with hands-on work, like agriculture.

Therefore, based on these traits, we can reasonably estimate that Adam has a significantly higher likelihood of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to an average graduate student.

Given this qualitative assessment, we can estimate a high posterior probability, acknowledging that exact numerical calculation would usually require more context or a Bayesian model with prior probabilities and likelihoods. For this exercise, we can reasonably estimate as follows:
