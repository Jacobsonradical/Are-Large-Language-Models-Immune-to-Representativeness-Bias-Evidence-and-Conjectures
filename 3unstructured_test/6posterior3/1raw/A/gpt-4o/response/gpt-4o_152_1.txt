  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, there is a high probability that he would be interested in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts further increase the likelihood that he would pursue a field that requires both theoretical understanding and practical application. Therefore, a posterior probability of 0.7 is a reasonable estimate.
