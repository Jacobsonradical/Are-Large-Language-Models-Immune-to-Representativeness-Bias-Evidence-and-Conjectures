To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we would typically use Bayes' theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can only make a qualitative judgment based on how well Adam's personality matches the typical characteristics of someone in that field.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, his deep love for animals, as well as his strong empathy and appreciation for hard work, he seems to have a profile that would be well-suited for agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Therefore, the posterior probability is subjectively evaluated based on the match between his characteristics and those necessary for success in agricultural and veterinary science.
