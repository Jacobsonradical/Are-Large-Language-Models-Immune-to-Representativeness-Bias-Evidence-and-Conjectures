To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to consider the likelihood of someone with his characteristics choosing this field.

Given:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy.
- Deep love for animals.
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Agricultural and veterinary science is relevant to many of these traits:
- Curiosity about nature and plants aligns with agricultural studies.
- A deep love for animals aligns with veterinary science.
- Empathy is important in caring for animals.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns with the demanding nature of agricultural and veterinary careers.

Though exact numerical values are subject to assumptions and specific data about graduate students in the U.S., based on the qualitative analysis, the characteristics match quite well with agriculture and veterinary science.

Let's assign a posterior conditional probability based on the strong alignment of Adam's traits with the field:
