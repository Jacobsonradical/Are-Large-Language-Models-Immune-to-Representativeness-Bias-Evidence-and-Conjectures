To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to utilize Bayesian inference. Generally, we'd need the prior probability of enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science (P(A)) and the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science (P(S|A)), as well as the overall probability of such a personality sketch regardless of the field (P(S)).

For simplicity, let’s assume the following:

1. **P(A)** (the prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science) is not specifically given, but let’s say it is modest given the vast number of fields one could be in.
   
2. **P(S|A)** (the likelihood of Adam’s personality given he is in the agricultural and veterinary science field): Adam’s personality traits, such as love for nature, plants, and animals, strong empathy, and intelligence, align well with this field. So we would assume this likelihood to be fairly high.

3. **P(S)** (the probability of Adam's personality sketch across all fields): Given that Adam's traits are quite specific, let’s assume this is neither too common nor too rare, but we don’t have the exact number.

Given Adam's strong alignment of personality traits with what might be expected in agricultural and veterinary science, we would estimate this posterior probability to be reasonably high, though impossible to pinpoint accurately without more data.

This is a computed estimation and should ideally be validated with more precise statistical data and information about graduate students' field distributions and personality sketches.
