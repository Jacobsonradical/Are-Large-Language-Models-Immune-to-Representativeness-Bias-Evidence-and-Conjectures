To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we use Bayes' theorem. For simplicity, we will assume that we have limited information and have to work with qualitative reasoning and estimated probabilities.

### Bayes' Theorem
Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability, i.e., the probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood, i.e., the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability, i.e., the general probability of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood, i.e., the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all possible fields of study.

### Assumptions and Estimations
1. **P(A)**: Let's estimate the prior probability, \( P(A) \). According to various academic sources, a small percentage of graduate students in the U.S. are enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's hypothetically set this prior at 0.05 (5%).
2. **P(B|A)**: The personality traits such as a deep love for animals, strong empathy, genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work fit well with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this likelihood at 0.8 (80%).
3. **P(B)**: Given the personality sketch, let's roughly estimate the overall probability of such a personality among all fields at 0.2 (20%) since traits like empathy and curiosity about plants can be quite common but specificity to nature and animals somewhat narrow it down.

Using these estimates:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.2} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.04}{0.2} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.2 \]

### Conclusion
Given the assumptions and estimates, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.2 (20%).
