To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to make a qualitative assessment based on the details provided.

From Adam's personality sketch, we see the following relevant traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants
- Strong empathy and deep love for animals
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts

These traits align well with the interests and skills typically associated with agricultural and veterinary science. People in this field often have a strong connection to nature, care deeply about animals, and exhibit dedication to their work, all of which match Adam's described personality.

Typically, a Bayesian approach would require prior probabilities about Adam's likelihood of being in various fields, as well as likelihoods of exhibiting these traits given enrollment in each field. However, without specific numerical data, we can make a reasoned qualitative estimate.

Given the strong alignment of Adam's traits with agricultural and veterinary science, we can estimate a fairly high conditional probability:
