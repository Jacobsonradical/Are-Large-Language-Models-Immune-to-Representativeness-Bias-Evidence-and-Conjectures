To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. Although this involves complex calculations that would typically require specific data on prior probabilities and likelihoods, I will provide a reasonable qualitative estimate based on his personality traits.

Adam has traits such as:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Deep love for animals.
- Warm heart and strong empathy.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work.

These traits are highly conducive to a field like agricultural and veterinary science, which involves working with nature and animals and requires both dedication and intellectual capability.

Thus, while we do not have the exact quantitative data to provide a precise numerical probability, we can make an informed qualitative assessment.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

This value indicates a high likelihood given his personality sketch.
