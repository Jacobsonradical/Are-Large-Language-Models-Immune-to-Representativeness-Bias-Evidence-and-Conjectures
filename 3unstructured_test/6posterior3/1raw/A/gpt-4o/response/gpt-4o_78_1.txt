To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is formulated as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the personality traits given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the personality traits observed.

Without specific data on the probabilities, we'll make educated estimates based on Adam's personality:

1. **P(B|A)**: Probability that Adam's personality traits fit agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Given his love for nature, plants, animals, and high empathy, it seems highly likely that he would fit well in this field.
   - Estimate: \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \)

2. **P(A)**: Prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Less common compared to some other fields such as business or engineering.
   - Estimate: \( P(A) \approx 0.05 \) (5%)

3. **P(B)**: Overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits in the entire population of graduate students.
   - While some of these traits are common (curiosity, intelligence), others may be less so (high empathy, love for animals).
   - Estimate: \( P(B) \approx 0.2 \) (20%)

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.2} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.045}{0.2} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.225 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.225 (22.5%).
