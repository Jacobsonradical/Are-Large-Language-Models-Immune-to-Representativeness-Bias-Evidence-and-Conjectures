To compute the posterior conditional probability, we ideally need to know the prior probability of Adam choosing agricultural and veterinary science as a field of study, along with the likelihood of his personality traits given each possible field of study. However, since we don't have specific statistical data, we make some reasoned assumptions based on the given personality sketch.

1. **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Highly relevant.
2. **Love for animals**: Highly relevant.
3. **Empathy and warm heart**: Relevant, as these traits are valuable in dealing with animals and understanding their needs.
4. **Intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: Maybe slightly relevant for research and advanced study in this field.
5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Relevant for the demanding nature of this field.

Given these traits, we see a high match between Adam's personality traits and the requirements/desires in the field of agricultural and veterinary sciences.

So, when using qualitative reasoning, a relatively high probability seems reasonable. An actual numerical value would require more specific statistical background data for precision, but an educated estimate can be made.
