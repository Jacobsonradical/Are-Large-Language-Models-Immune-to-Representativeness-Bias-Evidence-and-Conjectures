To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, in the absence of specific figures associated with prior probabilities and likelihoods, we will rely on a qualitative approach to provide an estimate.

Given Adam's personality sketch, let's analyze the key points:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These characteristics align well with someone who might pursue a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity about nature and love for animals are strong indicators of interest in this field.

Using Bayes' theorem in a qualitative manner, we infer that:
- The likelihood of someone with Adam's traits being in the agricultural and veterinary science field is reasonably high.
- If we assume a basic low prior probability for any specific graduate program enrollment (since there are many fields and each would have a small prior individually), the posterior probability can be considered moderate to high given his specific personality alignment with the field.

Therefore, we estimate the posterior conditional probability:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
