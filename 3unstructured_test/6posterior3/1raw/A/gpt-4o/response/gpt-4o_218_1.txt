To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we would generally utilize Bayes' Theorem. However, we lack specific numerical probabilities such as prior probabilities for his enrollment in various fields and likelihoods of his personality traits given each field.

Nonetheless, we can qualitatively assess the fit of Adam's personality traits with the field of agricultural and veterinary science:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants: Highly relevant to agricultural sciences.
- Love for animals: Directly relevant to veterinary science.
- Warm heart and strong empathy: Important traits for dealing with animals in veterinary science.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Useful in any graduate field, including agricultural and veterinary science.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Particularly important in fields dealing with nature and animals.

Given this qualitative alignment, we infer a relatively high posterior probability:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
