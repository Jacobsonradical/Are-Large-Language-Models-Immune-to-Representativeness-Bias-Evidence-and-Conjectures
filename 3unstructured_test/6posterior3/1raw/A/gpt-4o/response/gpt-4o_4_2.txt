To determine the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' theorem. However, we don't have all the necessary prior data and likelihoods explicitly provided. Therefore, we will have to make justifiable assumptions based on the information given.

From the personality sketch:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He has a deep love for animals.
- He is intelligent and enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has strong empathy and a warm heart.

Given these traits, especially his love for nature, plants, and animals, it seems reasonable to assume a higher probability of his enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science compared to less relevant fields. 

Since we have no exact priors or likelihoods, we'll make a qualitative assessment to assign a probability value.
