  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, where he has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems highly probable. While we can't determine the exact probability without knowing the overall distribution of graduate students in each field, these personality traits align well with a focus on agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, I estimated the probability to be relatively high at 0.75.
