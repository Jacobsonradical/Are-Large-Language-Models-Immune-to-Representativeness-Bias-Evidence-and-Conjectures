Computing the exact posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is quite complex without specific statistics on the distribution of students across different fields and how personality traits correlate with field of study choices. However, we can qualitatively assess the likelihood based on the provided traits.

Considering Adam's attributes:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Love for animals.
3. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work.
4. High intelligence and capability to grasp abstract concepts.
5. Warm heart and strong empathy.

These traits align well with the kind of personality that might thrive in agricultural and veterinary science, a field that involves working with plants and animals, applying scientific concepts, and dedicating oneself to the well-being of living organisms.

Given this qualitative analysis, we can reasonably assign a higher likelihood to this field compared to others not mentioned, but without exact numerical data, this remains an estimate.
