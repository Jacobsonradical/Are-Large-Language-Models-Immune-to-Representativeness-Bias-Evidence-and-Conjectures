To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we would typically need to employ Bayesian reasoning. However, without specific empirical data on the base rates (prior probabilities) and likelihoods of Adam's traits given each possible field of study, an exact numerical value cannot be rigorously computed. Instead, I can provide a qualitative assessment based on the provided information.

Given Adam's inherent curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals, agricultural and veterinary science seems a highly compatible field for him. His strong empathy and warm heart also fit well with the nurturing aspects often associated with these fields. High intelligence and appreciation for hard work further support his potential success in this area.

Hence, qualitatively assessing this:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

This represents a strong likelihood given his personality traits and interests, but it's important to note that this is a subjective assessment based on the provided information rather than a precise calculated probability.
