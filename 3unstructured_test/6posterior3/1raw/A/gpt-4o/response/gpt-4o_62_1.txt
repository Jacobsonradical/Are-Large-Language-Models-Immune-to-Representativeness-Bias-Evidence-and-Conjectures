To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we will emphasize key elements of his traits that are aligned with this field. 

Let's take into account the following aspects of his personality:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. A deep love for animals.
3. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given this profile, it seems relatively likely that a person with Adam's interests and characteristics would pursue a field such as agricultural and veterinary science. 

Without more specific probabilities or data on student distributions across various fields, it's challenging to give a highly precise numeric probability. However, based on the alignment of his traits with the field, we can make a reasoned estimate.

Thus, a reasonable posterior conditional probability given the personality sketch could be estimated as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
