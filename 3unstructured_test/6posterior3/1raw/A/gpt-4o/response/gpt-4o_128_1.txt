To compute the conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well the description of his qualities aligns with the typical characteristics and interests of someone in this field. 

Adam is described as having:
- A genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- A deep love for animals.
- Strong empathy and a warm heart.
- High intelligence and good problem-solving skills.
- An appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits are highly congruent with those needed in agricultural and veterinary science. Experts in these fields are usually passionate about nature, animals, and plants, empathetic towards animal welfare, and possess problem-solving skills to tackle complex biological systems and environmental challenges. 

Given this strong alignment, the probability would be quite high. Although exact numeric probabilities would typically require more rigorous statistical data, a reasoned estimate considering the qualitative alignment might yield a value close to 1.
