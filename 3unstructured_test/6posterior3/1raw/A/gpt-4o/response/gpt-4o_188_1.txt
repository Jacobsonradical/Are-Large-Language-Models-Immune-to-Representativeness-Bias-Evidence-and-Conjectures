To compute the posterior conditional probability, we should ideally have data regarding the prior probabilities of enrolling in different fields and the likelihood of having specific personality traits given those fields. However, in the absence of such detailed data, we can make an estimation based on the provided sketch of Adam's personality. Given Adam's strong appreciation for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, it seems reasonably likely that he would be inclined towards a field aligning closely with these interests.
