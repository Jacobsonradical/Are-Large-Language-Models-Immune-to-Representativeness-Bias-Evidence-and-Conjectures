To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities or likelihoods, we must rely on qualitative reasoning based on the description provided.

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are all highly compatible with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit well with the rigors of a graduate program in this field.

Based on these considerations, we can reasonably infer a high posterior conditional probability, though it would be somewhat subjective without specific data.

Given these qualitative factors, I would estimate the probability as follows:
