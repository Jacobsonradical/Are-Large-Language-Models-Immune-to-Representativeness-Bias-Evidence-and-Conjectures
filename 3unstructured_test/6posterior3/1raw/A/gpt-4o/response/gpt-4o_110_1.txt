The rationale behind this probability is based on Adam's evident passion for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his high intelligence and strong empathy. These traits align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, which focuses on the study of plants, animals, and the environment. His interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts further supports the compatibility with this field, which often requires analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. Thus, a higher posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in this field is justified.
