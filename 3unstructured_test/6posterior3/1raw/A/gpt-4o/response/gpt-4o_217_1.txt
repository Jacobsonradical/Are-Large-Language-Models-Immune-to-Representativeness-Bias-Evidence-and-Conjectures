To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to consider the following:

1. The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is an agricultural and veterinary science student.
2. The overall probability of being an agricultural and veterinary science student among graduate students.
3. The overall probability of Adam's specific personality traits among all graduate students.

Given limited specific statistical data in the problem, we'll make a qualitative judgment based on the provided information, estimating how well Adam's characteristics align with typical characteristics of students in agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's evaluate:

- **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Highly relevant to agricultural science.
- **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals**: Strong indicator for veterinary science.
- **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**: Neutral or slightly positive relevance, as both fields can involve detailed and intricate problem-solving.
- **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: Relevant as graduate studies typically require this.
- **Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Relevant, as both fields can be demanding.

Given these alignments, we can qualitatively estimate that Adam's traits do highly correlate with that of someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the posterior probability could be considered high, but without specific data, an exact calculation is challenging.

Hereâ€™s a qualitative estimation:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

This indicates a strong, but not absolute, likelihood based on the qualitative fit of his personality traits to those expected in the field.
