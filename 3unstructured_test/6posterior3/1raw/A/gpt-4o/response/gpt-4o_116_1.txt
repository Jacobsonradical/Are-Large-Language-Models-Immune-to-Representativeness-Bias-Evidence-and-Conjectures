To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we would need probabilistic information which is typically obtained from comprehensive datasets or domain knowledge regarding the likelihood distribution of graduate students' enrollment in various fields based on similar personality traits.

However, since we lack specific numerical prior and likelihood data, I'll provide a qualitative analysis based on the traits described:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**: This strongly aligns with agricultural science.
2. **Love for animals**: This aligns well with veterinary science.
3. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: These traits are advantageous in almost any scientific field, including agricultural and veterinary sciences.
4. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**: These traits are generally good in research-oriented fields.
5. **Warm heart and empathy**: These traits may be particularly crucial for veterinary science as it involves taking care of animal welfare.

Given these traits and their relevance to agricultural and veterinary sciences, there seems to be a strong alignment with this field. Without exact probability data points and working with qualitative reasoning, we can assign a high posterior probability to Adam being a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. 

Let's assign a tentative posterior probability:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

This suggests a strong likelihood (though not absolute certainty) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality profile.
