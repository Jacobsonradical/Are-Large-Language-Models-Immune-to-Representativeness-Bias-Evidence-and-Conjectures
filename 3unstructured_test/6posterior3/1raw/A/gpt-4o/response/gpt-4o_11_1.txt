To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to follow Bayesian inference. Here's how we might approach this:

1. **Prior Probability (P(agricultural and veterinary science)):** This is the probability that any given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science, before considering Adam's personality. Suppose we use a general estimate and assume that 5% of graduate students are in this field. Hence, P(agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.05.

2. **Likelihood (P(personality sketch | agricultural and veterinary science)):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's traits (love for nature, plants, animals, and his appreciation for hard work), it is reasonable to assume that these traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this probability to be high, say, 0.8.

3. **Marginal Probability (P(personality sketch)):** This is the probability of observing a personality sketch like Adam's, regardless of his field. To obtain this, we'd need to integrate over all possible fields, but we'll estimate it based on general traits observed in graduate students. Let's assume this is 0.10, considering that his traits are not extremely common among all fields.

4. **Posterior Probability (P(agricultural and veterinary science | personality sketch)):** Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(agricultural and veterinary science | personality sketch) = \frac{P(personality sketch | agricultural and veterinary science) \cdot P(agricultural and veterinary science)}{P(personality sketch)}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(agricultural and veterinary science | personality sketch) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.10} = 0.4
\]

So, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.4.
