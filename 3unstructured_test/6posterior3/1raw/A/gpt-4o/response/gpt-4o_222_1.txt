To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we simply analyze the overlap between his described traits and the key qualities beneficial or necessary for studying this field.

1. **Interest in Nature and Plants**:
   - Agricultural science involves extensive knowledge of plants and their ecosystems.
   - Veterinary science also involves understanding animal's diets and interactions with their environment.

2. **Love for Animals**:
   - Veterinary science is directly concerned with animal health and welfare.

3. **Empathy and Warm Heart**:
   - Both fields require compassion, particularly veterinary science due to the direct care for animals.

4. **High Intelligence and Abstract Concepts Understanding**:
   - Both fields require a good educational background and ability to grasp complex information.

5. **Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication**:
   - Agricultural studies involve rigorous, and often field-based, work.
   - Veterinary studies involve long hours and dedication to animal care.

Considering these alignments, there is a significant probability that Adam, with his described personality traits, might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Still, it is essential to remember there are various fields where Adam’s described traits can also be very useful.

Thus, assigning a posterior probability (an estimation based on given traits):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
```

This value represents a relatively high likelihood given the strong alignment of Adam’s interests and skills with the requirements and typical experiences in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
