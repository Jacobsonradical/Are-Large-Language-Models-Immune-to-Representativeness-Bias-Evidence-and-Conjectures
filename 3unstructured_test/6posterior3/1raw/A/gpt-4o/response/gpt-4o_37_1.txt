To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which is defined as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of Adam having the given personality traits, regardless of his field of study.

### Making Assumptions
1. **Empirical Data for Prior (P(A))**: Let's assume the general distribution of graduate students across various fields. For simplicity, imagine that the proportion of graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science is \( 0.05 \) (or 5%).
2. **Likelihood (P(B|A))**: Given Adam's deep interest and love for nature and animals, it is likely he exhibits these traits if he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this likelihood is \( 0.9 \).
3. **Marginal Probability (P(B))**: This is the overall probability of a graduate student having Adam's personality traits, which can be complex to estimate without specific data. But if we consider that curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation of hard work are relatively common, let's assume \( 0.3 \) (or 30%).

### Calculation
Using Bayes' theorem, we get:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.045}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.15 \]

Based on this calculation and the given assumptions, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is 0.15 (or 15%).
