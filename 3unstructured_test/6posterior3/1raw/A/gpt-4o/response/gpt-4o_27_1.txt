To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we could employ Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior and likelihood data, it's challenging to provide a precise probabilistic computation. Instead, we will make an educated guess by evaluating the fit between Adamâ€™s personality traits and the field of agricultural and veterinary science.

Adam's personality sketch includes:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals.
3. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
4. Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these traits, agricultural and veterinary science seems to be a field that fits well with his characteristics. His love for animals and nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align closely with the motivations and interests generally associated with this field.

Thus, based purely on alignment with his personality traits:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}

This is a subjective estimate that acknowledges the close match between Adam's personality and the chosen field.
