To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, it should be noted that we do not have the actual numerical priors or likelihoods, so we will have to make a reasoned estimate.

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Adam having the given personality sketch if he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of having the given personality sketch among all graduate students.

Based on knowledge about the field of agricultural and veterinary science and Adam's personality traits (strong empathy, love for animals, understanding and appreciation for hard work, and curiosity about nature and plants), we can assume:

- \( P(B|A) \) is high because Adam's traits align well with those typically found in agricultural and veterinary science fields.
- \( P(A) \) is relatively low since not all graduate students are enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(B) \) is an overall probability of possessing Adam's personality traits, which may be relatively low among all graduate students.

Since we are estimating, we can still conclude that the evidence favors Adam being a good fit for the mentioned field. However, this is not an exact calculation but rather an informed estimate based on qualitative alignment.

Given our considerations, we would estimate the posterior probability in the form requested:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This value reflects a strong but not absolute likelihood based on the alignment of his personality traits with typical characteristics of students in this field.
