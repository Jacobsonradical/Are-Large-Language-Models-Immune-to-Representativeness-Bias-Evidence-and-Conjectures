To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, let's use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is represented as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch.

We do not have exact values for these probabilities, so we must make some reasonable assumptions based on the provided information.

### Assumptions:
- Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align closely with someone in the agricultural and veterinary science field.
- Agricultural and veterinary science fields often attract individuals with these personality traits.
- We must also consider the broader context of all possible fields Adam might be enrolled in and the likelihood of each, given that he is a graduate student in the U.S.

### Estimations:
1. **\( P(B|A) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high, considering his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. We can estimate this probability to be around \( 0.8 \) (8 out of 10).
2. **\( P(A) \)**: The prior probability of a U.S. graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low compared to fields like engineering, business, and social sciences. However, given Adam's specific traits, we might adjust this to reflect a higher probability than the general population but still moderate. Letâ€™s assume \( 0.1 \) (1 out of 10).
3. **\( P(B) \)**: The probability of a random graduate student in the U.S. having Adam's personality traits might be moderate among all fields. It accounts for the generalized probability of such traits. Let's estimate this to be around \( 0.3 \) (3 out of 10), acknowledging that these traits aren't exclusive but somewhat common in those associated with STEM fields, including life sciences.

Using these approximations:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.08}{0.3} \approx 0.267 \]

So, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is around 0.267 (or 26.7%).
