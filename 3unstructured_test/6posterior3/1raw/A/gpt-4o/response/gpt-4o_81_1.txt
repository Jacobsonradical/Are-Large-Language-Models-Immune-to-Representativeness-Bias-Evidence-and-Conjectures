To compute the posterior conditional probability, we'll apply Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here, we look to update the probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of Adam being in "agricultural and veterinary science" given his personality traits.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Adam having his particular personality traits given he is in "agricultural and veterinary science".
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of someone being in "agricultural and veterinary science".
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of someone having Adam's personality traits.

Given the assumptions:
1. **P(A):** The prior probability of being in "agricultural and veterinary science" in the graduate student population. Let's assume this is relatively low, say \(0.05\) (since grad students overwhelmingly pursue other fields).

2. **P(B|A):** The probability of having Adam's personality traits if he is in "agricultural and veterinary science". Given his traits match very well with interests typically found in this field, we can assign a high value, say \(0.8\).

3. **P(B):** The overall probability of having Adam's personality traits in the general population of graduate students. Considering his traits are not extremely unique but also not typical for all fields, let's assume this to be \(0.1\).

Inserting these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.04}{0.1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.4 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.4"
}
