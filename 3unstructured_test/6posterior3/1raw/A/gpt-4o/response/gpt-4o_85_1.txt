To compute the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits match those typically associated with that field.

Given information to consider:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Lover of animals.
3. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
4. Empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science, which often requires an understanding of plant biology, animal care, hard work, and dedication.

However, without additional statistical information on the general population of graduate students and how common these traits are among those in agricultural and veterinary science versus other fields, we must make a qualitative judgment.

A reasonable assumption might be that Adam's traits are quite consistent with someone in agricultural and veterinary science, albeit not exclusively so. Hence, while recognizing the subjective nature of this judgment in the absence of concrete data, we could estimate the posterior conditional probability as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
```

This reflects a high likelihood, based on how closely Adam's personality aligns with interests and competencies in agricultural and veterinary science, but recognizes that other fields might also be a fit.
