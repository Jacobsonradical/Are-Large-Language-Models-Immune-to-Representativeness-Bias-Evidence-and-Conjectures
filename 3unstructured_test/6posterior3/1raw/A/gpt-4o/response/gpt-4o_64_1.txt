The posterior conditional probability takes into account Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and understanding/appreciation for hard work, all of which align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Given these traits and his status as a graduate student in 2021, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability, like 0.75, that Adam was enrolled in this field.
