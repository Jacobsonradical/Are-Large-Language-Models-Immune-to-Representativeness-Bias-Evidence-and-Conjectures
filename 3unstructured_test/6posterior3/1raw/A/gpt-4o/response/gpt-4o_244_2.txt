To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can draw from the personality traits mentioned and how they align with the field's characteristics.

While a detailed Bayesian calculation would require specific prior probabilities and likelihood functions, I can give a reasoned estimate based on the alignment of his traits with the field.

Key personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Warm heart and strong empathy.
- Deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these personality traits, agricultural and veterinary science seems highly aligned, especially considering his love for animals and nature. 

Thus, an estimate value for the probability could be:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
