To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics align with the typical traits and interests of students in that field. 

Here's a quick summary of the provided personality sketch:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Now, let's compare this to characteristics likely found in students of agricultural and veterinary science:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants is strongly relevant.
- Strong empathy and love for animals are highly consistent with veterinary science.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are beneficial for any graduate field, including agricultural and veterinary science.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns well with the demands of agricultural and veterinary fields.

Given these considerations, Adam's personality traits are highly consistent with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Although this is a Bayesian inference problem and ideally we'd use prior probabilities, likelihoods, and Bayes' theorem for a precise calculation, we'll make a reasoned estimate based on the information provided.

Therefore, the posterior probability is:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

This value represents a high likelihood but not absolute certainty, considering the alignment of his traits with the demands and characteristics of the field.
