To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( B \) is the evidence given by Adam's personality sketch.

### Assumptions for Calculation:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   The probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. For simplicity, let's assume this field makes up about 5% of all graduate fields of study:
   \[ P(A) = 0.05 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(B | A) \)**:
   The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for plants, animals, nature, empathy, and abstract understanding, this likelihood is relatively high. Let's estimate it as:
   \[ P(B | A) = 0.8 \]

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(B) \)**:
   The overall probability of observing Adamâ€™s personality traits across all fields of study. Assuming there's no specific data, consider graduate students in fields requiring empathy, understanding of nature, and abstract thinking (like psychology, biology, environmental science). A rough estimate might be:
   \[ P(B) = 0.2 \]

### Calculation:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.2} = \frac{0.04}{0.2} = 0.2 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is:
