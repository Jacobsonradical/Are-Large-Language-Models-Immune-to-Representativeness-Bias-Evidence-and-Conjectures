Explanation:
Given Adam's personality sketch, several traits make it plausible that he might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His love for nature, genuine curiosity about plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals directly align with this field. Additionally, his high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication support the likelihood that he is drawn towards a demanding and rewarding field like agricultural and veterinary science.
