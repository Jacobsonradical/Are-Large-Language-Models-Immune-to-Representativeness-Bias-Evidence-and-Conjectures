To compute the posterior conditional probability, we use Bayes' theorem. However, since specific probability values and distributions are not provided, we can offer a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch provided. 

Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align well with fields that require an understanding of living organisms, dedication to their care, and an interest in the natural world. Agricultural and veterinary science are fields that require such traits. 

Given this alignment, we would reasonably infer that the probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high compared to an arbitrary selection of fields.

Thus:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

This probability value is presented based on the qualitative match between Adam's personality traits and the requirements of the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
