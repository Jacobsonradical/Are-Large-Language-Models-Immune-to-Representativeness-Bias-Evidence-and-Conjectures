To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" given his personality sketch, we apply Bayes' theorem. However, it is important to note that exact numerical probabilities require more data than what is provided, such as prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in different fields and the likelihood of each personality trait given those fields. We can, nonetheless, make a qualitative assessment.

Given Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants**: Relevant to agricultural science.
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**: This could fit multiple fields.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals**: Particularly relevant to veterinary science.
4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: This is broad but fits well with scientific research.
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Relevant to any graduate-level field.

From the provided traits, we see a strong alignment with both agricultural and veterinary science due to the nature-focused, animal-focused, and science-research-oriented attributes.

Therefore, based on the qualitative assessment, here is the posterior conditional probability in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This value is an estimation based on the alignment of his personality with traits typically associated with students in agricultural and veterinary sciences, acknowledging that precise numerical values would need more detailed statistical data.
