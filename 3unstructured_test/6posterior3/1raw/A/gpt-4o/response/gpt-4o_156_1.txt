  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}

Explanation: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, his love for animals, and his strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is reasonable to infer that there is a relatively high probability that he was enrolled in a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His traits and interests align well with what is typically required and appreciated in these fields. However, without more specific data, we cannot place the probability at 1. A value of 0.75 suggests a strong likelihood but leaves room for uncertainty.
