To compute the posterior probability, we'd ideally need more detailed information such as prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in various fields of study and the likelihood of a person with Adam's personality traits enrolling in each field. However, based on the given sketch alone, we can make an educated assessment.

Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work strongly align with the interests typically found in someone studying agricultural and veterinary sciences. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also suggest he could succeed in many graduate programs, but the love for animals and nature significantly weighs in favor of this specific field.
