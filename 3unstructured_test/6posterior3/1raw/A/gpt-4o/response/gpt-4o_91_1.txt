To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian inference, incorporating Adam's qualities and various prior information. However, without exact prior probabilities or a dataset to draw from, we can provide a qualitative estimate based on his described traits and interests.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, it is reasonable to hypothesize that he might be inclined toward a field like agricultural and veterinary science. This field aligns well with many of the traits described.

Here is the estimated posterior probability:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}

This estimate hinges on the assumption that Adam's personality and interests strongly correlate with a field dedicated to animals and nature, though exact calculation would need more quantitative data.
