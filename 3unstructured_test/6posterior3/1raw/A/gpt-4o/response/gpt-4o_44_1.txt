To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we need to consider the relevant components of his personality that align with this field. The provided sketch gives us several key characteristics:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants.
2. Deep love for animals.
3. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
4. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits align very well with someone interested in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Given that these fields require a strong understanding of biological systems, plants, and animals, and given Adam's attributes, the posterior conditional probability can be considered quite high. However, without exact empirical data, this is an estimation based on qualitative reasoning.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
