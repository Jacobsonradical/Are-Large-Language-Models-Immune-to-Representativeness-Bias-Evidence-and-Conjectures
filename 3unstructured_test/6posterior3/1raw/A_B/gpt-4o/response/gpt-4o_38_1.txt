To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or business administration given his personality sketch, I will make some qualitative assessments based on his interests and characteristics.

Given:
1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. He is a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles.
3. He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
4. He is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. He appreciates hard work and dedication.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Adam's curiosity about nature and plants directly corresponds with this field.
- His love for animals is a strong indicator.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work align well with the scientific and research demands of this field.

Given these points, the conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is high.

**Business Administration:**
- Adam's personality traits, such as being quiet, having strong empathy, and enjoying puzzles, don't directly correspond with the common skill set and interests typically associated with business administration.
- However, his intelligence and appreciation for hard work can be relevant but are less specific to this field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these points, the conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is lower.

Hence, the probabilities are qualitatively assessed as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These values reflect the high alignment of Adam's personality with agricultural and veterinary science and the lower, yet possible, alignment with business administration.
