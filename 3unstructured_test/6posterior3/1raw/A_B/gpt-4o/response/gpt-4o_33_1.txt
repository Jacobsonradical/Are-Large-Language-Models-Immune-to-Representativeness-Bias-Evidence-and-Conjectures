To calculate the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in business administration or agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayesian inference. Here's the formal approach:

1. **Define prior probabilities:**
   - Let's denote the prior probabilities as P(B) for business administration and P(A) for agricultural and veterinary science. Without specific data, we cannot assign precise numbers to these priors, but we can assume some notional baselines based on typical enrollment distributions.

2. **Define the likelihoods:**
   - The likelihood of a personality trait given the field of study is key. We'll denote:
     - P(Given_Traits | B) for business administration 
     - P(Given_Traits | A) for agricultural and veterinary science

3. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(Field | Given_Traits) = \frac{P(Given_Traits | Field) \cdot P(Field)}{P(Given_Traits)}
   \]
   Since we are comparing the probabilities for two fields only, the denominator is a normalizing constant and can be ignored for comparative purposes.

Now, estimating based on Adam's personality sketch:
- Adam has traits that align more closely with fields related to nature, animals, empathy, and abstract problem-solving.
- Agricultural and veterinary sciences are likely to have a higher likelihood given these traits (high P(Given_Traits | A)), whereas business administration typically aligns with more pragmatic, finance-oriented, and managerial traits.

Given this, let's assign notional values to the likelihood and priors:
- Suppose P(B) = 0.2 (a prior probability assuming general population distribution)
- Suppose P(A) = 0.05 (a prior probability assuming general population distribution, noting it might be a smaller field than business administration)

Let's assume the likelihoods based on the traits:
- P(Given_Traits | B) ≈ 0.1 
- P(Given_Traits | A) ≈ 0.6

Using Bayes' theorem, the unnormalized posteriors are roughly:
- P(B | Given_Traits) ∝ 0.1 * 0.2 = 0.02
- P(A | Given_Traits) ∝ 0.6 * 0.05 = 0.03

Converting these into normalized probabilities:
\[
\text{Total sum} = 0.02 + 0.03 = 0.05
\]
\[
P(B | Given_Traits) = \frac{0.02}{0.05} = 0.4
\]
\[
P(A | Given_Traits) = \frac{0.03}{0.05} = 0.6
\]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are approximately:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```
