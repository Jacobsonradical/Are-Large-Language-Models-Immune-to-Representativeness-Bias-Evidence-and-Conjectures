To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field (A) given his personality sketch (B).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is in a particular field (A).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field (A).
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits regardless of the field.

Given that the exact prior probabilities (\( P(A) \)) and other necessary probabilities are not provided, we will rely on qualitative reasoning instead.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - High empathy is a trait often aligned with those in agricultural and veterinary fields.
  
   These traits closely align with agricultural and veterinary science, suggesting a higher \( P(B|A) \).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Some traits like intelligence and empathy could be beneficial in business.
   - However, traits like a love for nature, animals, and a quiet disposition are less indicative of business administration.
  
   This implies a lower \( P(B|A) \) compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can provide estimates:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10
}

These values are derived based on the alignment of his personality traits with the typical characteristics of individuals in these fields.
