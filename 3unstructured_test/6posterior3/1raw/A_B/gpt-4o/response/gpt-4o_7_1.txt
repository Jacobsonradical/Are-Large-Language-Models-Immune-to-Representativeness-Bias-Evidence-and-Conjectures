To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality traits align with the typical characteristics of students in the specified fields. We'll use a qualitative approach based on the given personality sketch.

For **agricultural and veterinary science**, let's evaluate:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Highly relevant.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Moderately relevant (good for problem-solving in scientific fields).
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals: Highly relevant, especially for veterinary science.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Relevant (important in all fields).
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant (important across all fields but key in labor-intensive and emotionally demanding fields like veterinary science).

For **business administration**, let's evaluate:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Not particularly relevant.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Relevant (important for strategic thinking and problem-solving).
- Warm heart, strong empathy: Moderately relevant (good for leadership and management).
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Relevant (necessary for understanding business models and strategies).
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant (important for success in any field).

Given the alignment of the traits, Adam's personality fits better with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration.

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities might be approximated as:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```
