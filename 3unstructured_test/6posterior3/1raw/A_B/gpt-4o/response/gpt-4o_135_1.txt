To compute the posterior probabilities, let's denote:

- \( P(Business) \) as the prior probability that Adam is in business administration.
- \( P(Agriculture) \) as the prior probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(Personality | Business) \) as the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration.
- \( P(Personality | Agriculture) \) as the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(Personality) \) as the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(Business | Personality) = \frac{P(Personality | Business) \cdot P(Business)}{P(Personality)} \]
\[ P(Agriculture | Personality) = \frac{P(Personality | Agriculture) \cdot P(Agriculture)}{P(Personality)} \]

Since we don't have specific values for the priors and likelihoods, we'll make qualitative judgments based on Adam's personality traits.

1. **Business Administration (MBA)**:
   - Business students often possess traits like leadership, an interest in economics, finance, or management.
   - Adam's personality sketch does not strongly suggest these traits.
   - Therefore, \( P(Personality | Business) \) is likely low.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - This field aligns well with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - Therefore, \( P(Personality | Agriculture) \) is likely high.

Given these assessments, if we assign qualitative, relative probabilities based on these assessments and normalize them:

{
  "business administration": 0.1, 
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}

These values suggest that Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, compared to business administration.
