To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which requires us to consider both the prior probabilities of a graduate student being in each field and the likelihood of the observed personality traits given each field. While specific numerical data on graduate field enrollments and personality trait distributions is typically required for precise computation, we can make qualitative assessments based on the available information. 

Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Business Administration**: This field generally attracts individuals who are interested in business strategy, leadership, finance, and management, which does not strongly align with Adam's personality traits such as a deep love for nature and animals, empathy, and curiosity about plants. 

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field fits well with Adam’s characteristics, as it involves a deep understanding and appreciation for nature, plants, animals, and often requires empathy, dedication, and intelligence to handle complex biological systems and solve related problems.

Based on these assessments, we can infer the following qualitative probabilities:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

The exact numerical values are illustrative and would require real data for precision, but qualitatively, Adam’s traits highly suggest a stronger fit for Agricultural and Veterinary Science over Business Administration.
