To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or business administration, given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. However, detailed statistical data is often required for a precise Bayesian calculation. In absence of such specific prior probabilities and likelihoods for the domains, we shall proceed with a heuristic approach based on the suitability of Adam's personality traits to each field.

Given Adam's:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants
- Love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Quiet demeanor, enjoying puzzles, warm heart, and strong empathy

This profile strongly suggests alignment with fields related to nature, animals, and possibly science. Business administration, which often requires more social interaction, leadership, and a focus on financial, managerial, and organizational concepts, does not align as well with his personality sketch.

We will express our heuristic estimate as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85, // High probability due to strong alignment with Adam's traits and interests.
  "business administration": 0.10 // Lower probability due to lesser alignment with his traits.
}

These values reflect an estimation based on the descriptive alignment of Adam's characteristics with the nature of these fields. Note that exact probabilities would require more specific data.
