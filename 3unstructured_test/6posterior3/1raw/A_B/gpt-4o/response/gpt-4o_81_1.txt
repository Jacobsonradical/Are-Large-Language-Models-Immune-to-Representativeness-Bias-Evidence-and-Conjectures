Given the personality sketch provided for Adam, we can infer certain details that align more closely with specific fields of study. Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy strongly suggest an affinity towards agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, there is no direct indication that he has interests or traits typically associated with business administration, such as a focus on economics, leadership, or managerial skills.

Taking this into account, here's a rough estimation for the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.05"
}
```

This suggests that it is much more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality traits, though always taking into consideration that these are estimations based on the provided information and not absolute certainties.
