To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific graduate field given his personality sketch, we need to make some assumptions about the likelihood of each field based on his described traits.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work, it seems more likely that he would be interested in a field related to nature and animals. His interest in abstract concepts and intelligence could be applicable to either field, but his strong empathy and love for animals tilt the scales towards agricultural and veterinary science.

For business administration, while it is possible that someone with high intelligence could be in this field, the described traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.) do not strongly align with typical characteristics we might expect for someone whose main interest is business.

Given these considerations, I will assign subjective, approximate probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
