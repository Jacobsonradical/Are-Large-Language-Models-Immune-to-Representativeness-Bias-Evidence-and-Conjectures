To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how Adam's personality sketch aligns with the typical traits and interests associated with each field. 

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits strongly align with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, as this field often involves working with plants and animals, requiring both a passion for nature and animals and a great deal of dedication.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with good abstract thinking.

While these traits can be beneficial in Business Administration (which requires problem-solving skills and understanding abstract concepts), the other traits related to empathy for animals and interest in nature do not necessarily align closely with what is typically valued in this field.

Given these alignments, we can estimate the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect the strong alignment of Adam's interests and skills with Agricultural and Veterinary Science and a moderate, but less strong, alignment with Business Administration.
