To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "business administration" given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well each of these fields aligns with his interests and traits. 

Given his passion for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work, it seems that an inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science is more likely. Conversely, the field of business administration does not strongly align with his described interests and personality traits. 

Here's a reasonable assessment of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These values are subjective estimates based on the alignment between Adam's personality and the typical attributes needed and valued in those fields.
