To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "business administration" given his personality sketch, I'll make some educated assumptions based on his characteristics:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants** - This strongly points to agricultural and possibly veterinary science, as these fields are inherently linked to nature and its flora.
2. **Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles** - This could apply to both fields; however, solving puzzles seems closer to natural and scientific inquiry.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals** - This further leans towards veterinary science, given the emphasis on animals.
4. **High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts** - Both fields require intelligence, but abstract concepts might lean more towards theoretical sciences.
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication** - This is applicable universally, so it doesn't differentiate much between the two fields.
6. **Graduate student in the U.S. in 2021** - This element doesn't convey a preference but shows that he is pursuing an advanced degree.

Given these points, it is reasonable to infer that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in a field that includes his interests in nature, plants, and animals, i.e., agricultural and veterinary science. 

Based on this assessment, I'll suggest the following values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

Note that these are estimations meant to reflect the described personality traits' alignment with the respective fields. The actual values would depend on more specific context and data.
