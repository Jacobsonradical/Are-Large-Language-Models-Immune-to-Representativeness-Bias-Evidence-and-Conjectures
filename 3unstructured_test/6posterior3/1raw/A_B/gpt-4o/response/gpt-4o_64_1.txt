To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we can consider how well his personality traits align with the typical characteristics and interests of students in these fields. This method doesn't produce exact numerical probabilities but offers a reasoned qualitative assessment based on available information.

Here is the reasoning:
1. Business Administration: This field typically attracts individuals who are interested in management, finance, entrepreneurship, and leadership. While Adam's high intelligence and understanding of dedication could be assets in this field, there is no specific mention of interests or skills directly related to business administration in his personality sketch.

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: This field aligns well with Adam's interests and characteristics. His genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are very pertinent to agricultural and veterinary science. Additionally, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also be beneficial in this field.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can infer that the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high, while the probability of him being enrolled in business administration is relatively low.

Using this qualitative assessment, we can express the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values should be understood as approximate reflections of the qualitative alignment between Adam's personality and the typical interests and skills required in these fields. Exact probabilities would require additional information and data on graduate student enrollments and their personality distributions.
