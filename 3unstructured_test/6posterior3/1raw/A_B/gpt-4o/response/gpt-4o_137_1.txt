To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch and assuming no specific base rate for these fields of study, we will qualitatively assess how well Adam's personality traits align with each field.

1. Business Administration: Typically, students in this field might be more focused on analytical thinking around business, leadership, management, and economic strategies. While Adam does have high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, these traits are not directly indicative of a preference for business administration, given his strong curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: This field directly aligns with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals. His empathy and appreciation for hard work further support this alignment. Thus, the probability is relatively high that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given this qualitative assessment, the posterior conditional probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This reflects a higher probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
