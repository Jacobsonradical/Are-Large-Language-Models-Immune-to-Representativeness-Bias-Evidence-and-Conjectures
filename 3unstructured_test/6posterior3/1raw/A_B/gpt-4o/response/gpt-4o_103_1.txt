To estimate these posterior probabilities, we need to consider both Adam's interests and attributes as described and the typical characteristics associated with students in those fields. The personality sketch strongly suggests a leaning towards interests in nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving, as well as empathy and dedication—traits that are more commonly associated with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.

Using a Bayesian reasoning approach, we can normalize our judgment qualitatively. Let's assign rough probabilities:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam’s profound love for nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood of him being in this field is quite high.
- **Business Administration**: While Adam's intelligence and affinity for understanding abstract concepts are positive traits for business administration, his strong interest in nature and animals, along with his empathic traits, make this less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Thus, we can estimate:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
```

These probabilities recognize the significant relevance of Adam’s personality traits to each field, specifically emphasizing the alignment with agricultural and veterinary science.
