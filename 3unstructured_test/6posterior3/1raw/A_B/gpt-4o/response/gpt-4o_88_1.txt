To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality traits align with the typical traits and interests of students in each of the given fields. While exact numerical probabilities would generally require more detailed statistical analysis and data, we can qualitatively assess the likelihood based on the provided information:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits are highly aligned with interests typically found in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Students in these fields often have a passion for nature, animals, and the hard work involved in studying them.

- Business Administration: While Adam is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could be useful in business administration, his strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals and nature do not strongly align with the typical traits and interests of students in this field. Business administration students often prioritize leadership, management, and organizational skills, rather than a deep connection to nature and animals.

Thus, we can infer that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration based on his personality sketch.
