To answer this question, we need to consider Bayes' theorem and how well Adam's personality sketch fits each field. However, since we don't have exact numerical values or specific statistical distributions at hand, I'll approach it qualitatively to provide an educated estimate.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, his personality seems a better fit for Agricultural and Veterinary Science than for Business Administration. This qualitative fit will guide our estimates.

Here is the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}
```

These values are estimated based on how well Adam's personality traits align with the typical traits and interests expected in each field. The probabilities do not need to add up to 1 because there are other possible fields he could be enrolled in.
