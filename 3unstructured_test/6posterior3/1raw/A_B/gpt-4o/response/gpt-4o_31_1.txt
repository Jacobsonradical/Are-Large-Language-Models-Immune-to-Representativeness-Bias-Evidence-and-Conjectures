To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam being enrolled in each of these fields given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning. Although exact probabilities would typically require detailed prior knowledge and data about enrollment statistics, student personality traits, and so on, we can estimate probabilities based on how well his personality aligns with the typical traits expected in each field.

For "agricultural and veterinary science":
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He has a deep love for animals.
These traits are strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.

For "business administration":
- There is less direct alignment with Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals.
- His interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence can fit many fields, including business administration, but softer traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication aren't as specific to business.

Based on the personality sketch, here's an estimation:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science given Adam's strong alignment with nature and animals, as compared to business administration.
