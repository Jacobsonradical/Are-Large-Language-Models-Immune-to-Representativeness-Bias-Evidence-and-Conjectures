To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we would typically use Bayes' theorem, which requires prior probabilities and the likelihood of Adam's characteristics given each field. Since we don't have exact priors or detailed likelihoods, we can make educated estimates based on the provided personality sketch and the nature of each field of study. 

Given Adam's personality traits like a genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it makes sense that he might be more inclined towards a field that involves nature and animals, such as agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, his personality does not particularly align with traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, competitiveness, and financial interest.

Here are the posterior conditional probability estimates based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
```

These estimates reflect the strong alignment of Adam's interests and traits with agricultural and veterinary science and a much weaker alignment with business administration.
