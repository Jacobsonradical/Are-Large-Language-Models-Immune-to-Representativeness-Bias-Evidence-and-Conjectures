Given Adam's personality sketch, let's consider the relevance of each field to his characteristics when estimating the posterior probability that he was enrolled in each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
   - These characteristics align well with a focus on agriculture and veterinary science.
   
2. **Business Administration**:
   - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts can be relevant.
   - However, his strong empathy and love for animals and nature seem more aligned with a science-focused field rather than business.

Given this information, the probabilities could be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These estimations consider the alignment of Adam's interests and personality with each field. Note that these probabilities are subjective estimations based on the given personality sketch.
