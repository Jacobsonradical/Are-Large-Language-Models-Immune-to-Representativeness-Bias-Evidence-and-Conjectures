To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field, given his personality sketch and described traits, I will make use of Bayesian reasoning while relying on qualitative assessment of the likelihood that a person with Adam's characteristics would pursue each field. This involves ranking how well the provided personality sketch aligns with typical profiles for the given fields.

Let's assess each field based on Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
   - Warm heart
   - Deep love for animals
   - High intelligence
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication

2. **Business Administration**:
   - High intelligence
   - Understanding abstract concepts
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication

From these assessments, it's clear that Adam's traits align more closely with Agricultural and Veterinary Science than Business Administration given his deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and warm heart.

Given this assessment and understanding that these probabilities are subjective plausibility assessments based on the personality traits, here is a reasonable estimate:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```
These values reflect the idea that Adamâ€™s personality traits are much more closely aligned with a field like Agricultural and Veterinary Science than Business Administration, although it's not impossible for Adam to pursue Business Administration.
