To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or business administration, given his personality sketch, we use the information provided.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals. These traits align closely with interests and values typically associated with agricultural and veterinary science.
   
2. **Business Administration**
   - While Adam is intelligent and understands abstract concepts, his traits of empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature and plants do not align strongly with typical traits or career interests found in business administration.

Given these observations, we can estimate conditional probabilities intuitively. Note that these are subjective estimates due to lack of numerical data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values suggest that based on his personality, Adam is much more likely to have been studying agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.
