To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we must base our evaluation on how well his traits align with the typical characteristics of students in those fields. This matching can give us a qualitative estimate, but it will not be precise without statistical data. However, we can infer the following probabilities based on the given information:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Businesses typically value strategic thinking, leadership qualities, and an interest in economics and organizational behavior. While Adam's intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could align with business administration, the rest of his profile (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) does not strongly align with this field.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - This field highly values knowledge of plants and animals, empathy towards living creatures, and a dedication to understanding natural phenomena. Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathetic nature strongly align with a career in agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.15",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.85"
}
```

These numbers are qualitative and approximate Adam's fit for each field based on his personality traits, without actual likelihood data or proportions of students in each field.
