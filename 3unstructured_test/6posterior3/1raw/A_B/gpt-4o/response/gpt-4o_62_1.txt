To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, an exact numerical value cannot be calculated. Instead, we will use qualitative logic to estimate likelihood.

Let's analyze the elements of his personality sketch in the context of the two fields:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Less relevant
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Somewhat relevant, but not strongly indicative of this field
   - Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals: Less relevant
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Somewhat relevant, as business analysis can involve abstract reasoning
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Highly relevant
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Relevant, as solving issues related to plant and animal health can be seen as puzzles
   - Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals: Highly relevant
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Relevant
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant, especially given the demands of this field

Given these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect the significantly higher alignment of Adam's personality traits with agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. The specific values are illustrative and inferred based on the given personality sketch rather than computed from quantitative data.
