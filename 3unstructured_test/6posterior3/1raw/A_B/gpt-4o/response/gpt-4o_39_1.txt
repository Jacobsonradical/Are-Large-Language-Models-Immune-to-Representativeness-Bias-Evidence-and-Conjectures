To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in one of the specified fields given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well Adam's interests and qualities align with those typically found in each field. 

Let's break down Adam's characteristics:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. Quiet demeanor, enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Analysis:

**Business Administration:** 
- Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with the typical characteristics associated with business administration. While intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest a different area of interest.
  
**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy perfectly align with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also support this field, as it often requires deep scientific knowledge and problem-solving skills related to living organisms.

Based on the given sketch, the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is higher than that for business administration.

Here is the posterior conditional probability represented numerically:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect the stronger alignment of Adam's interests and personality traits with agricultural and veterinary sciences.
