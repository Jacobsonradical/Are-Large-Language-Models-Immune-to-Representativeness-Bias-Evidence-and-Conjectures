To compute the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or business administration based on his personality sketch, we should consider how well the characteristics described align with typical traits of students in these fields.

Given Adam's personality:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals highly align with traits desirable for someone in the agricultural and veterinary sciences. Furthermore, his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be very beneficial in such a scientific and research-oriented field.

2. **Business Administration**: While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts certainly could be beneficial in business administration, his love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy are not typically associated with this field. Business administration often favors traits like leadership, strategic thinking, and a focus on commerce and economics, which are not highlighted in Adam’s personality sketch.

Based on this analysis, I would assign the following approximate posterior probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These values reflect the strong alignment of Adam’s interests and traits with agricultural and veterinary science and the weaker alignment with business administration.
