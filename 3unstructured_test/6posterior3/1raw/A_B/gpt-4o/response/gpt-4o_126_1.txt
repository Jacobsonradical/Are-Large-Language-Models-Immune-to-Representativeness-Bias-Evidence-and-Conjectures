To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we would typically employ Bayes' theorem, which involves the prior probability of enrollment in a field, the likelihood of the personality traits given the field, and the evidence (total probability of the personality traits across all fields).

Since we don't have specific data for prior probabilities or likelihoods, we can use a qualitative reasoning approach based on how well Adam's characteristics fit with each field. 

Given Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and strength in understanding abstract concepts, it's reasonable to surmise that Adam's traits align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.

Here’s a qualitative estimation:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and a warm heart make this field a highly probable choice. These traits are essential for professionals in this field who have to work closely with animals and plants.

2. **Business Administration:** While Adam’s high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business administration, the other traits such as empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature don't have as direct a connection to a graduate program in business administration.

Given these qualitative assessments, here are the estimated posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values are heuristic estimates based on the personality traits described and their alignment with the typical needs and environment of each field.
