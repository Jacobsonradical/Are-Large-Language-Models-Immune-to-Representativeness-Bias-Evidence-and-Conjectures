To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or business administration given his personality sketch, we need to consider the alignment between his personality traits and the typical traits associated with success and enrollment in these fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, and empathy. These characteristics align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science, which involves understanding plants, animal care, and an appreciation for nature.

### Business Administration
While Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, qualities which can be beneficial in business administration, there is no specific indication of interest or inclination towards business and its various aspects such as management, finance, or corporate operations in his personality sketch.

Using this qualitative assessment and applying Bayes' theorem roughly in the context of how well his characteristics fit each field, we can estimate the probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

This suggests that given his personality traits, Adam is significantly more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
