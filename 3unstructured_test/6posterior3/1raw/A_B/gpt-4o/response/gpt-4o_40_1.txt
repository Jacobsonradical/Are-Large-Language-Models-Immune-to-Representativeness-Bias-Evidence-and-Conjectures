To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality and interests align with each field. While we don't have exact numerical data, we can make an informed qualitative judgment based on the information given.

- In business administration, qualities such as strategic thinking, leadership, and a focus on financial success are often valued. Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals do not strongly align with these characteristics.
  
- Agricultural and veterinary science is a field closely related to Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and interest in hard work and dedication, making this a much stronger fit for his personality.

Considering these points:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect the qualitative assessment that Adam is far more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
