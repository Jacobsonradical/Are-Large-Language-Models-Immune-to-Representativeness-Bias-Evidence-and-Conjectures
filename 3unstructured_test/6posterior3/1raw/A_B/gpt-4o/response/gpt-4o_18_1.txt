To compute posterior probabilities in this context, we need to rely on the given personality sketch of Adam, which describes his interests, traits, and intellectual capacity, in relation to the fields of agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration.

1. Agricultural and veterinary science:
   - Relevant traits: Genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, deep love for animals, appreciation for hard work and dedication, and a high level of intelligence.
   - These traits suggest a higher likelihood that Adam would be interested in a field closely related to nature and animals.

2. Business administration:
   - Relevant traits: High intelligence, solving puzzles.
   - Traits like high intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities can be valuable in business administration, but the sketch lacks specific mentions of interest in business, economics, or organizational leadership.

Based on the personality traits and interests described:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.15
}

Thus, it is more probable that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration given his personality sketch.
