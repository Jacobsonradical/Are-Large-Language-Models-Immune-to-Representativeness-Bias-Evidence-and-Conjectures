Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses about the probabilities. These probabilities are subjective and based on how well Adam's traits align with typical characteristics and interests in each field.

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - High curiosity about nature and plants aligns well with agricultural science.
   - A deep love for animals aligns perfectly with veterinary science.
   - Strong empathy is a valuable trait for someone working with animals.
   - Understanding abstract concepts can be beneficial in scientific research.

2. **Business administration**:
   - His personality sketch does not align particularly well with business administration given the absence of traits typically associated with this field, such as a focus on finance, management, or entrepreneurship.
   - The warm heart and strong empathy might be valuable, but aren't as strongly indicative of a fit for business administration.
   - Understanding abstract concepts is useful, but this is a common trait among many fields.

Based on these considerations, the subjective conditional probabilities might be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science due to his interests and traits, compared to business administration.
