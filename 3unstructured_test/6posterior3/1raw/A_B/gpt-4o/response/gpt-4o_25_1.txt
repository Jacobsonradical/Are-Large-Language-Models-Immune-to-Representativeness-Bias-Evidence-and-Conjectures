To compute the posterior conditional probability, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

However, since we don't have the actual prior probabilities \(P(A)\) or the likelihood \(P(B|A)\) for each field, we have to rely on qualitative reasoning based on the personality sketch provided.

Given Adam's attributes:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration. Therefore, we can reasonably assign higher posterior probability to Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Here is the answer in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

This assumes that Adam's traits are significantly more aligned with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. This is not a precise calculation and doesn't use specific data, but it's based on a reasonable qualitative assessment.
