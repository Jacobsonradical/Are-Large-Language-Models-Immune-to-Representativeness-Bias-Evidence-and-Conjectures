To compute the posterior probabilities, we consider the personality traits described in Adam's sketch and how well they align with the typical characteristics required or suited for the given fields.

For "business administration":
- Business administration often values skills such as leadership, management, communication, and financial acumen.
- While high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be relevant, the other traits such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are less directly aligned.

For "agricultural and veterinary science":
- This field would highly value Adam's traits, including his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy.
- His intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts would also be beneficial.
- Additionally, his appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns well with the demands of this field.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can provide a more informed estimation of the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's personality traits are much more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
