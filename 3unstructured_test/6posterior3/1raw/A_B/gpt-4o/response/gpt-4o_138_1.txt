To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in business administration and agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Although we do not have the exact prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the given information.

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, understanding of hard work and dedication, and empathy align strongly with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, these characteristics do not align as clearly with business administration, which typically involves a different set of interests and skills.

Here are the qualitative assessments:

1. **Business Administration**: His traits such as empathy and intelligence are valuable in business, but his interests in nature, plants, and animals are not directly related.
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are directly relevant to this field.

Given this qualitative assessment, we can assign higher posterior probability to agricultural and veterinary science than to business administration.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are indicative and based on the provided personality sketch, reflecting a higher probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
