To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we will use Bayesian reasoning. Our prior beliefs about the probabilities of being majors in these fields should be updated in light of the new evidence provided by the personality sketch.

Given personality traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and empathy, Adam's profile fits more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration. Business administration typically appeals more to those interested in organizational practices, economics, finance, and management, which are not strongly indicated by Adam's personality sketch.

Here's a plausible approximation of the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}
```

Please note that these values are subjective estimates. Computing exact conditional probabilities would require specific statistics about personality trait distributions across these fields.
