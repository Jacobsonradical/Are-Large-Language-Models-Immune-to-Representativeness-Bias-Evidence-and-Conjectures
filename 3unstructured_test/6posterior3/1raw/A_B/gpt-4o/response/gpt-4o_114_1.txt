To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, with the data provided, it is not possible to compute numeric probabilities without further statistical data on the probabilities of students in each field having the described personality traits. Instead, we can make qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality fit to each field. 

Adam's personality shows a strong alignment with nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles, which suggests a higher probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. Additionally, his empathy and appreciation for hard work would mesh well with caring for animals and biological research.

Therefore, we can provide a relative assessment:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

This qualitative assessment suggests that given Adam's personality sketch, there's a higher likelihood he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration. The values are not exact probabilities but reflect the relative fit of his personality to each field.
