To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular graduate field given his personality sketch, we'll use a combination of prior probabilities and likelihoods based on his described traits. For simplicity, let's assign approximate likelihoods based on the given information without actual data.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication do not strongly suggest an inclination towards business administration.
   - His quiet nature and interest in puzzles could occur in various fields, but they are less indicative of a typical business administration student.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - His curiosity about nature and plants strongly points towards this field.
   - His empathy and love for animals directly align with veterinary science.
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work matches the dedication required in agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Given these points, we assign rough probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,  // Lower likelihood based on traits
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8  // Higher likelihood based on alignment with personality traits
}

These values are subjective estimates based on the narrative provided and not based on an empirical dataset.
