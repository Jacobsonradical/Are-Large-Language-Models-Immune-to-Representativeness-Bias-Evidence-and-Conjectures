To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we can use a qualitative approach that relies on the given traits and preferences.

Here is how the analysis would look:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Adam demonstrates a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, and he has a deep love for animals. These traits align closely with the interests typically associated with Agricultural and Veterinary Science students. His strong appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with the demanding nature of this field. Considering these factors, the probability of Adam enrolling in Agricultural and Veterinary Science seems quite high.

### Business Administration
While Adam is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which can be beneficial in Business Administration, the other aspects of his personality sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) do not strongly align with the typical interests or characteristics associated with Business Administration. Thus, the probability of Adam being enrolled in this field seems comparatively low.

Taking all this into account:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These values are estimates based on the qualitative alignment of Adam's personality traits with the typical attributes and interests associated with each field. They do not sum up to 1, reflecting the fact that there could be other plausible fields of study not considered in this analysis.
