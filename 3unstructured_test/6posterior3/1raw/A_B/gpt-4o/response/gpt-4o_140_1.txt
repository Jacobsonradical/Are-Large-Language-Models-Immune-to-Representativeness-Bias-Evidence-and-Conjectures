To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities, we would ideally use Bayes' theorem, which requires prior probabilities for each field and a likelihood function based on the personality traits. However, without specific prior data, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the provided personality sketch. 

Given Adam's traits—curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work—there is a strong alignment with characteristics typically found in agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, these traits do not strongly align with what is typically required in business administration, such as a focus on economic theory, leadership, and organizational management.

So, qualitatively, we can assert the following posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

This indicates that it is significantly more likely that Adam was enrolled in an agricultural and veterinary science program compared to a business administration program based on his personality characteristics.
