To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to utilize Bayes' theorem. This theorem states that the posterior probability is proportional to the likelihood of the personality traits given the field, multiplied by the prior probability of being enrolled in that field.

Given the personality sketch, Adam seems particularly well-suited for fields related to nature, plants, animals, and possibly complex problem-solving. These traits align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.

Let's denote:

- P(A|S) as the probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch S.
- P(B|S) as the probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch S.

We must consider both the likelihood of Adam's traits given each field and the prior probability of students being enrolled in those fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Likelihood of personality traits given field: High (traits such as curiosity about nature, warm heart, empathy, love for animals align well).
   - Prior probability (proportion of students in this field): Moderate.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Likelihood of personality traits given field: Low (traits such as strong empathy, love for animals align less).
   - Prior probability: Higher (more students generally enroll in this field than in agricultural and veterinary science).

For simplicity, let's assume the following rough likelihood values, which favor stronger alignment with agricultural and veterinary science:

- Likelihood of personality traits given agricultural and veterinary science: ~0.8
- Prior probability of agricultural and veterinary science: ~0.2
- Likelihood of personality traits given business administration: ~0.1
- Prior probability of business administration: ~0.4

Applying Bayes' theorem qualitatively (and without specific numerical integration), our posterior probabilities would be adjusted from these products. Given the stronger alignment with agricultural and veterinary science and adjusting qualitatively:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Explanation:
- "agricultural and veterinary science" is given a higher posterior probability due to a higher alignment between Adam's traits and the field, despite a lower prior probability.
- "business administration" has a lower posterior probability due to a weaker alignment with Adam's personality traits, despite a higher prior probability. 

Note: These values are subjective and illustrative, as precise computation would require detailed statistical data.
