To compute posterior conditional probabilities, one would typically use Bayes' Theorem, which in its general form for two hypotheses (H1 and H2) is expressed as:

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H1|E) \) and \( P(H2|E) \) are the posterior probabilities of hypotheses H1 and H2 given evidence E.
- \( P(E|H1) \) and \( P(E|H2) \) are the likelihoods of evidence E given hypotheses H1 and H2.
- \( P(H1) \) and \( P(H2) \) are the prior probabilities of H1 and H2.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence E.

Given Adam's personality traits (genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work), we can qualitatively assess the likelihoods for him being in the fields of "agricultural and veterinary science" versus "business administration." 

**P(H1): Prior Probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

Considering the provided traits align strongly with characteristics beneficial in "agricultural and veterinary science" – love for nature, animals, and plants – we might assume a higher prior probability.

**P(H2): Prior Probability for Business Administration**

The given traits align less with common traits associated with "business administration," such as a strong focus on management, financial acumen, and strategic business thinking. Therefore, this would have a relatively lower prior probability.

Based on these factors, we make reasonable qualitative assessments without actual numerical values for priors and likelihoods.

Given these considerations, let's estimate as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Note: The values provided are based on qualitative assessment rather than exact Bayes' Theorem calculations since exact numerical priors and likelihoods for these fields given Adam's personality traits are not provided.
