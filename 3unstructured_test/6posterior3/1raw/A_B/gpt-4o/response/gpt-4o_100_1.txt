To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we can use a qualitative Bayes-like approach. Although we won't use numerical data, we'll consider how well Adam's characteristics fit with each field. Here, we'll apply subjective reasoning based on the personality traits described.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, and his empathy align well with this field. Such characteristics are highly beneficial for someone studying agricultural and veterinary sciences, where interpersonal skills with animals and understanding of ecosystems are crucial.

2. **Business Administration:** Adam's attributes do not align as well with this field. While his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts might be beneficial, business administration generally requires a strong interest in commerce, management, and organizational leadership, which are not highlighted in his personality sketch. His quiet nature and strong empathy are not quintessential traits for a typical business administration student.

Considering these factors, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
