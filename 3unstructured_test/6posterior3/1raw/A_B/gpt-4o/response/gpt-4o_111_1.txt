To compute posterior conditional probabilities, we'd typically use Bayes' theorem. However, here we do not have prior probabilities or likelihoods in the form of data. Instead, we can make an informed estimate based on the provided personality sketch and its alignment with typical characteristics of students in each field.

Given Adam's attributes such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and a strong understanding of hard work, he seems like a much better fit for Agricultural and Veterinary Science than for Business Administration. 

Business Administration generally requires different traits, such as interest in management, finance, and strategy, which are not highlighted in his personality sketch.

Given this, the probability estimates would look as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect the stronger alignment of Adam's personality with Agricultural and Veterinary Science over Business Administration.
