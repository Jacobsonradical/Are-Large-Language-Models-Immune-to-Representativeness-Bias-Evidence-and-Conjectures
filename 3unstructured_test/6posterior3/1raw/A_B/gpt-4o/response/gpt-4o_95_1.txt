To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need some prior knowledge or assumptions about the distribution of students across the fields in question, as well as how well Adam's personality traits fit those fields. Given the absence of specific statistical data, I'll use qualitative reasoning based on the provided personality sketch to estimate the probabilities.

Adam has a strong love for nature, animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. This aligns well with the agricultural and veterinary science field. His empathy and warm heart are also positive traits for someone in this field. On the other hand, his skills in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could be useful in business administration, but the rest of his interests and traits don't particularly align with the typical personality associated with business administration.

Using qualitative reasoning, we can say:

- Adam's probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high given his strong alignment with the field's typical personality traits.
- Adam's probability of being enrolled in business administration is relatively low due to the mismatch between his personality traits and the typical demands or interests of that field.

Therefore, the estimated probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values are heuristic estimates meant to reflect the qualitative alignment of Adamâ€™s personality traits with the respective fields.
