To solve this, we need to consider how closely Adam's personality traits align with the typical requirements and interests associated with each field of study. Here's how these considerations might be weighed:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field frequently aligns with a passion for nature, plants, animals, and often involves an understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication. 

2. **Business Administration**: While intelligence and problem-solving skills are beneficial, this field doesn't particularly emphasize a love for animals or nature or a high degree of empathy. 

Given these considerations, we can assign higher posterior conditional probability to the field that most closely matches Adam's attributes.

With the above rationale in mind, here's the posterior probability distribution:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These figures reflect a higher probability that Adam is in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality traits, interests, and values.
