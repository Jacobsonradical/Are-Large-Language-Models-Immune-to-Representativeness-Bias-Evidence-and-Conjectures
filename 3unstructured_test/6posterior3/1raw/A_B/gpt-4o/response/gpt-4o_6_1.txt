To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to assess how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with the typical characteristics of students in each field. Bayes' theorem is often used for such calculations, but without specific prior probabilities (i.e., the proportion of graduate students in each field), we will qualitatively assess the alignment and provide rough probabilities.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, he seems to align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and grasp of abstract concepts could be beneficial in business administration, but these traits are not as clearly aligned with his personality sketch.

Here's an estimate of these probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Please note these probabilities are illustrative and based on qualitative assessment rather than exact statistical computation. They should serve as a rough guide rather than precise values.
