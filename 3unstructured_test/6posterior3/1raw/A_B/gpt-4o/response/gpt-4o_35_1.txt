To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, since we do not have access to specific prior probabilities or likelihoods, we will need to make reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch.

Adam's personality sketch highlights attributes that align more closely with fields that involve nature, animals, and dedication, which suggests a higher likelihood of enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.

Here is a reasonable assignment of posterior probabilities based on the provided sketch:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These probabilities reflect that while it is possible for Adam to be in business administration, his defined interests and empathy for animals make it much more likely that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
