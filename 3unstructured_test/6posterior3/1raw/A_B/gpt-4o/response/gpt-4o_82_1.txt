To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or business administration given his personality sketch, we would use Bayes' theorem. However, in lieu of specific numerical data regarding the base rates (prior probabilities) of students in these fields and the likelihood of the given traits being associated with graduates in these fields, we will base our estimates on qualitative analysis of the given information.

Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, his empathy, and his intelligence, it is reasonable to conclude that these traits are highly compatible with agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, these traits are less indicative of a strong fit for business administration, which typically emphasizes skills and interests such as leadership, financial acumen, marketing, and organizational behaviorâ€”a contrast to Adam's described characteristics.

Given these subjective judgments and without specific probabilistic data at hand, here are the posterior conditional probability estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

This estimation suggests that Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, based on the personality traits described.
