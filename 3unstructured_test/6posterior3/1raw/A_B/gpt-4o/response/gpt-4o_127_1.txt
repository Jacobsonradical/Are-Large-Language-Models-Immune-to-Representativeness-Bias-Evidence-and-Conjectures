To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his described traits match the typical characteristics or interests of students in those fields.

Given the description:
- A genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits are highly congruent with a field like agricultural and veterinary science, as it involves working with animals, plants, and nature, requiring empathy for animals and a strong appreciation for hard work. On the other hand, business administration typically benefits from traits like leadership, strategic thinking, and organization skills, which are not explicitly mentioned in the personality sketch.

Based on this reasoning, let's assign posterior conditional probabilities accordingly:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,  // Relatively low as not much in the personality sketch specifically points to business administration
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8  // Very high as many traits align closely with this field
}

Please note that these are estimated probabilities based on the given personality sketch and typical characteristics of each field.
