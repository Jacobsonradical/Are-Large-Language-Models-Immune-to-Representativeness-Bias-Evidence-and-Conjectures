To compute the posterior probabilities, we can use Bayesian reasoning. We need to consider Adam's traits and how they align with the typical traits of individuals in these fields. However, without specific base rates or detailed likelihood data, this will be an educated estimation.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- Interests in nature, plants, puzzles, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation of hard work align closely with fields like agricultural and veterinary science.
- These traits don't strongly align with the typical characteristics or interests needed for business administration, which often involves strategic thinking, financial acumen, leadership skills, and less of an explicit focus on nature and empathy towards animals.

Let's provide a value that reflects these considerations:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
