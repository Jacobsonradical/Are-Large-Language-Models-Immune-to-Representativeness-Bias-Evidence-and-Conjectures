To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the specified fields given his personality sketch, we use a qualitative approach based on how well his traits align with typical characteristics associated with those fields of study.

### Analysis:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants**: Strong alignment
- **Love for animals**: Strong alignment
- **Warm heart and strong empathy**: Fits well with the caring nature of veterinary science
- **High intelligence and abstract thinking**: Useful in both agricultural research and veterinary science
- **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Significant for success in these demanding fields

Given these factors, Adam's personality sketch aligns very well with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

#### Business Administration:
- **Intelligence and abstract thinking**: Useful for strategic aspects of business
- **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Important for the business field
- **Warm heart and empathy**: Could be beneficial for leadership and management roles

However, the connections to his curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and love for animals are weaker or irrelevant to this field.

### Conclusion:
Based on qualitative matching of Adamâ€™s personality traits with the characteristics needed or beneficial in each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These posterior conditional probabilities qualitatively reflect the stronger alignment of Adam's personality with Agricultural and Veterinary Science over Business Administration.
