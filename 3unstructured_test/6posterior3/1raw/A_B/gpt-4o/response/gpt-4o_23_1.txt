Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can infer certain probabilities regarding his potential field of study. The traits provided suggest a stronger alignment with fields that involve nature, animals, and abstract concepts, rather than business.

Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a warm heart, strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and high intelligence, the field of agricultural and veterinary science is a more natural fit for his personality.

On the other hand, business administration typically requires a different set of interests and skills, such as interest in corporate management, economics, and possibly leadership, which are not highlighted in the personality sketch provided here.

Thus, given the provided information, the posterior conditional probabilities might look something like this:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.80,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
```

These values are illustrative estimates based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the respective fields. Note that other fields of specialization where his traits might align well are not considered in this limited comparison.
