To compute the posterior probabilities for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we need to consider how well his described traits and interests match the typical characteristics and demands of students in each field. 

Let's outline the reasoning for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
    - Deep love for animals.
    - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
    
   Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals strongly aligns with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication is also a good fit for the demands of this field. Considering these points, the probability that Adam is enrolled in this field is relatively high.

2. **Business Administration:**
    - Strong intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
    - Empathy and a warm heart, which could be beneficial in leadership and management roles.
    
   While Adam's intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be valuable in a field like business administration, his specific interests in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathetic nature, suggest a stronger alignment with fields that involve direct interaction with living things rather than business processes. Therefore, the probability for this field is lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these considerations, here are the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These values reflect the higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits, with a smaller chance of him being in business administration.
