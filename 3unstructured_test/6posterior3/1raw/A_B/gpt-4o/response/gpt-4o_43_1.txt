To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we should consider how well his traits align with the typical qualities and interests of students in each field.

Given Adam's personality traits:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants
2. Quiet demeanor, enjoys solving puzzles
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
4. High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts
5. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's assess how these traits fit with the fields of "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration."

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Curiosity about nature and plants fits well.
- Love for animals is highly relevant.
- Empathy and warm heart are valuable in veterinary sciences.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work are important in scientific research fields.

Given these alignments, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is high.

**Business Administration:**
- Curiosity about nature and plants and love for animals are not typically relevant.
- Quiet demeanor and enjoyment of solving puzzles could fit, but not strongly indicative.
- Warm heart and empathy might be useful but not essential.
- High intelligence and abstract thinking are beneficial but not specific to business administration.
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work are helpful but general.

Given these alignments, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Here's the posterior conditional probability in the requested format:
