To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. However, since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can only make qualitative assessments based on the given information.

Given Adam's personality sketch, he has a strong curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has empathy and a deep love for animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication. These traits are more aligned with agriculture and veterinary science than with business administration. Business administration typically requires traits such as leadership, decision-making skills, and interest in organizational dynamics, which are not highlighted in Adam's personality sketch.

Given this qualitative assessment, here's the most reasonable approximation for the probability values:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are subjective estimates to show a higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits, while still allowing a small probability for business administration as we do not have exact data.
