To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, let \( P(A | B) \) represent the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field \( A \) based on his personality sketch \( B \). We can use Bayes' Theorem to approach this, but without concrete prior probabilities and likelihoods, we'll qualitatively assess the fit between Adam's personality profile and the field characteristics.

Given:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and a love for animals.
- He is empathetic and has a warm heart.
- He enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

These traits align closely with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, where one needs a deep understanding of nature, dedication, empathy (especially for animals), and intellectual abilities to solve complex biological problems. Conversely, while some traits could be beneficial for business administration (intelligence, puzzle-solving, appreciation for hard work), the empathetic nature and love for animals are less central to that field.

Considering these factors, the estimated posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect the strong alignment of Adam's personality with agricultural and veterinary science, and a lesser but possible fit with business administration. Further information about Adam's interests or academic background would refine these estimates.
