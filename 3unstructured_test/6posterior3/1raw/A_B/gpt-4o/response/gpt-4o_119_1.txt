To determine the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to consider how well Adam's personality sketch fits the typical characteristics of graduate students in the specified fields. 

For "business administration," typical characteristics might include an interest in corporate strategies, leadership, marketing, and entrepreneurship. Although some business students may share traits like intelligence and empathy, the strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles are less aligned with this field.

For "agricultural and veterinary science," typical characteristics may include a genuine curiosity about nature, a strong understanding of biological systems, empathy for animals, and an interest in the hard work associated with farming or veterinary practice. Adam's traits seem to closely match these characteristics.

Taking these factors into account, the probabilities might be assessed as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These values suggest that based on Adam's personality sketch, it's much more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, although he could also be in other fields not mentioned here.
