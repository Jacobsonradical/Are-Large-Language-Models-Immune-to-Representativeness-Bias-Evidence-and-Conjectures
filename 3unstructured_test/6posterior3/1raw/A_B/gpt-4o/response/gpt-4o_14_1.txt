To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits and the fact that he was a graduate student in 2021, we will use a qualitative approach based on the features of Adam's personality sketch. 

Given:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He is a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

These traits suggest a strong alignment with agricultural and veterinary science, as this field involves a deep relationship with nature, plants, and animals, along with a high level of empathy and an appreciation for dedication in caretaking and research.

In contrast, business administration typically does not prioritize these specific traits, especially a curiosity about nature and a strong love for animals. While business administration does value intelligence and an appreciation for hard work, these are more general attributes and do not specifically fit the personality sketch.

Therefore, the probabilities are assigned qualitatively as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
