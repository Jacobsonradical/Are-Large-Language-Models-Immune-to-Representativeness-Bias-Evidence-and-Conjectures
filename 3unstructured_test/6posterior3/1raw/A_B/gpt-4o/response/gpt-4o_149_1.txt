To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each field given his personality sketch, we would generally rely on Bayesian inference. However, without prior probabilities (the baseline likelihood of any graduate student enrolling in each field) and the exact likelihood of Adam's traits matching graduate students in each field, we'll have to make qualitative estimates based on the information provided.

Given Adam's personality traits—curiosity about nature and plants, enjoyment of solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work—these traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science more than they do with business administration.

Given this qualitative alignment, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

The value for agricultural and veterinary science is significantly higher because it aligns more closely with Adam's detailed interest and traits. The value for business administration is lower as his personality traits and interests don't significantly align with this field. 

Note that the sum does not equal 1 as specified, to accommodate other potential fields of study that are not considered in this estimate.
