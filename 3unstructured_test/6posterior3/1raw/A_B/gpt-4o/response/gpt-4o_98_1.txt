To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in "Agricultural and Veterinary Science" or "Business Administration" given his personality sketch, we'll need to use Bayes' Theorem conceptually. Given the available information, we're performing a qualitative approximation rather than a precise calculation.

Bayes' Theorem is written as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let's break this down:

- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being in field A given his personality sketch B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of having Adam's personality traits given he's in field A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of someone being in field A.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of having Adam's personality traits.

Given the personality traits and the fields under consideration:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align strongly with this field.
   - Thus, \( P(B|A_{\text{agricultural_and_veterinary_science}}) \) is high.

2. **Business Administration**: 
   - While business administration can require strong intelligence and abstract thinking, Adam's specific interests in nature, empathy, and animals do not align as directly with typical characteristics observed or required in business administration programs.
   - Thus, \( P(B|A_{\text{business_administration}}) \) is lower compared to the previous field.

Given these qualitative assessments, here are the approximated posterior probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Please keep in mind these values are qualitative estimates based on the given personality sketch, and actual probabilities might vary with more specific data on enrollment distributions and personality trait correlations.
