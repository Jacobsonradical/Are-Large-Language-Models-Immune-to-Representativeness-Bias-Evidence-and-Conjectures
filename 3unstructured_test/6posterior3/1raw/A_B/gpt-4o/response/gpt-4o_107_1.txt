To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, given the personality sketch of Adam, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states that the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \) is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without concrete data for these probabilities, we rely on the personality traits to make qualitative assessments. Adam's traits may correspond more naturally with certain fields than others.

Given the outlined traits:
Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work suggest a strong alignment with agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, his personality appears to be less aligned with the typical skills and interests associated with business administration, such as a focus on finance, management, and corporate strategy.

Thus, I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the alignment of Adam's personality with each field.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect the degree to which Adam's personality attributes align with each field. They are not absolute probabilities but rather indicative of the relative likelihoods based on qualitative assessment.
