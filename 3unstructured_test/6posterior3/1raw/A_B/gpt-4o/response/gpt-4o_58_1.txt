To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we will need to consider how well his personality and interests match the typical characteristics of students in those fields. Given that I don't have exact statistical data, this will be a qualitative assessment based on the sketch.

- **Business Administration**: Typically, students in business administration are interested in management, finance, economics, and related areas. Characteristics such as high intelligence can be relevant, but a strong focus on nature, plants, animals, and empathy does not strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field often attracts students who have a deep love for animals, a curious nature about plants, and an appreciation for hard workâ€”attributes that match Adam's personality sketch very well. Additionally, the blend of scientific curiosity and empathy is highly relevant in veterinary and agricultural sciences.

Based on these qualitative assessments, the posterior conditional probabilities might look something like this:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
```

These values represent a stronger likelihood that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, based on the information provided in the personality sketch.
