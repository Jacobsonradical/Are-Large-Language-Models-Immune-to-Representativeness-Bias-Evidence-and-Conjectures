To compute the posterior probabilities that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or business administration given his personality sketch, we'll base our reasoning on how his traits align with these fields.

Adam has a curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has empathy and a love for animals, and high intelligence with an understanding and appreciation for hard work. These traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science, which typically involves studying nature, caring for plants and animals, solving biological puzzles, and requires empathy for living creatures. 

On the other hand, while some of these traits can be beneficial in business administration (e.g., intelligence, problem-solving, and understanding hard work), many of his core interests (like a love for nature and animals) are less central to a typical business administration curriculum, which is more focused on economics, management, and organizational behavior.

Given these considerations, the probabilities can be estimated as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
