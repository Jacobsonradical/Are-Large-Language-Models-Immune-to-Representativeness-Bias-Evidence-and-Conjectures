To compute the posterior conditional probabilities for each field, we need to estimate how Adam's personality traits align with each field. Given the nature of Adam's interests and personality, we can make some educated guesses.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Generally requires skills and traits such as leadership, strategic thinking, and an interest in markets and management, which are not strongly highlighted in Adam's personality sketch.
   - Adam's strong empathy and enjoyment of solitary activities (like solving puzzles) don't strongly correlate with the typically extroverted and leadership-oriented traits often found in business.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - This field involves a significant understanding of nature and animal care, both of which Adam has shown a keen interest in.
   - His curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, align closely with this field.

Based on these considerations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values don't need to add up to 1, as they represent probabilities derived from the alignment between his personality traits and the fields of study, not excluding other potential fields he might be interested in.
