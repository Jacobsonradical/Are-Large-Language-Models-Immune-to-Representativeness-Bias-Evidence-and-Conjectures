To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of \( A \) given \( B \)
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of \( B \) given \( A \)
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of \( A \)
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of \( B \)

Given that we don't have specific prior probabilities or detailed data about graduate students in different fields, we'll make qualitative inferences based on the description provided.

Adam's personality traits include:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong understanding of and appreciation for hard work and dedication

### Qualitative Reasoning for Each Field

**Business Administration:**
- Typical traits might include leadership, strategic thinking, managerial skills, and an interest in market dynamics and human resources.
- Adam’s described traits do not strongly align with these characteristics.
- He seems more inclined towards fields involving nature, empathy, and problem solving in natural contexts.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Typical traits would include a love for animals, a curiosity about plants and nature, problem-solving in biological contexts, and a dedication to hard work and practical applications of science.
- Adam’s characteristics strongly align with these traits, making it a more likely field for him.

Based on this qualitative analysis: 

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These values are based on inferred alignment between Adam's personality and typical traits required for these fields of study. Note that the actual probabilities would depend on specific data and contexts which we do not have in this scenario.
