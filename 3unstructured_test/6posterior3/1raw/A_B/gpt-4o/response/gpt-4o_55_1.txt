To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch, one would typically consider Bayesian inference. Here, we primarily rely on subjective assessment given the provided traits and their relevance to the fields in question.

Adam's personality includes:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet demeanor
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted and empathetic
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good abstract reasoning
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Given these traits, let's subjectively evaluate the likelihood of him fitting into each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - While business administration does value high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, the personality traits of curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and a warm heart are less aligned with this field. The empathy and appreciation for hard work are somewhat beneficial, but overall, his personality seems less directed towards a business-focused career.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his deep love for animals, strongly align with this field. The empathy and warm-heartedness are crucial traits for veterinary roles, and his high intelligence and problem-solving skills are valuable for both agricultural and veterinary sciences. The appreciation for hard work and dedication fits seamlessly into these vocationally demanding fields.

Given this qualitative assessment, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values suggest that Adam is significantly more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration, based on his personality sketch. The remaining likelihood (not summing to 1) accounts for other potential fields of study that were not considered in this assessment.
