To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we will use Bayes' Theorem, which in its generic form is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

However, given the limited information, I'll make some reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch and common trends in graduate studies. 

Let's denote:

- \( P(\text{business administration}) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science
- \( P(\text{personality sketch} | \text{business administration}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration
- \( P(\text{personality sketch} | \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science
- \( P(\text{personality sketch}) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch

Adam's personality sketch strongly aligns with traits that are more common in fields like agricultural and veterinary science. Here, we assume:

- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.20 \) (20% of grad students in business)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.05 \) (5% of grad students in agri/vet science)

Let's consider likelihoods based on how well Adam's traits fit each field:

- \( P(\text{personality sketch} | \text{business administration}) = 0.10 \)
- \( P(\text{personality sketch} | \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.70 \)

The probability of Adam's personality sketch, \( P(\text{personality sketch}) \), can be considered the normalizing constant and isnâ€™t needed to compare these two probabilities relatively.

Applying Bayes' theorem for each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(\text{business administration} | \text{personality sketch}) \propto P(\text{personality sketch} | \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) \]
\[ P(\text{business administration} | \text{personality sketch}) \propto 0.10 \cdot 0.20 = 0.02 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | \text{personality sketch}) \propto P(\text{personality sketch} | \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | \text{personality sketch}) \propto 0.70 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

To find relative probabilities, we normalize these:

Total = \( 0.02 + 0.035 = 0.055 \)

So, the normalized probabilities are:

\[ P(\text{business administration} | \text{personality sketch}) = \frac{0.02}{0.055} \approx 0.36 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | \text{personality sketch}) = \frac{0.035}{0.055} \approx 0.64 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.36,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64
}
```
