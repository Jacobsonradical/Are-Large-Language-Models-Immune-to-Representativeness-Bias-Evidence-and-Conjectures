To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, let's apply Bayes' theorem conceptually, even though we may not have specific numerical data for prior and likelihood probabilities. Bayes' theorem is typically written as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of A given B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of observing B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of B.

For our scenario:
- A is the event that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- B is Adam's personality sketch.

Let's consider the fit of Adam's personality traits to each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Typically, this field would seek skills like leadership, strategic thinking, financial acumen, which are less directly aligned with Adam's sketch. He enjoys nature, solving puzzles, empathy, and animals, which doesn't strongly fit the stereotype of business administration students.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - This field is well aligned with Adam's personality traits. His love for nature, plants, and animals directly correlates with interests in agriculture and veterinary science. Empathy and dedication are also crucial in these fields.

Given these considerations, the proportional fit of Adam's personality with these fields can be estimated as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These values reflect the strong alignment of Adam's personality with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, in contrast to a weak alignment with Business Administration.
