To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch, we can informally use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior conditional probability of field \( A \) given personality sketch \( B \).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of personality sketch \( B \) given field \( A \).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of field \( A \).
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability of personality sketch \( B \) across all fields.

Given the subjective nature of the question and the lack of specific base rate data for \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \), we will use qualitative reasoning to estimate these probabilities.

Based on Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Strong empathy and love for animals.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
- Warm heart and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Adam's personality sketch is strongly aligned with characteristics that are typically associated with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration. 

With this qualitative analysis, let's estimate:

1. \( P(B|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is higher since his traits are more aligned with this field.
2. \( P(B|\text{business administration}) \) is lower since his traits don't strongly indicate a match for this field.

We don't have specific base rate data for \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) and \( P(\text{business administration}) \) but generally, business programs tend to have more students than specialized fields like agricultural and veterinary sciences, meaning \( P(\text{business administration}) \) might be higher in general. However, given the strong fit of Adam's traits with agricultural and veterinary science, we will compensate for the prior probabilities.

Let's assign subjective probabilities influenced by this reasoning:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}
```

These values indicate that Adam, given his personality traits, is highly likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
