To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, given the limited and qualitative nature of the information, I will provide an intuitive estimate based on Adam's personality sketch, rather than a precise numerical calculation.

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and understanding of hard work and abstract concepts could also be beneficial in this field. In contrast, while intelligence and understanding of hard work are valuable in business administration, his passion for nature and animals does not particularly align with typical interests in that field.

Here's an intuitive estimate:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect a higher probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality traits, with a much lower probability for business administration.
