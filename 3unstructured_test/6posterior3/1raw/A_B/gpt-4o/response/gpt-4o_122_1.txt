Given Adam's personality sketch, we can assess the likelihood of him being enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science in 2021. The key characteristics to consider include his genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work.

- **Business Administration**: This field generally focuses on managing businesses, finance, marketing, and organizational behavior. Though high intelligence is a plus, Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not directly align with this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field is closely related to Adam's interests, including plants, animals, empathy for living beings, and a strong work ethic. His personality sketch strongly suggests a fit with agricultural and veterinary science due to these alignments.

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
