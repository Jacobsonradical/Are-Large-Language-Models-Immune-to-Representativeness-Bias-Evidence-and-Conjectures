To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or business administration, we can leverage his personality traits and interests. 

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it aligns well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. His qualities like strong empathy, high intelligence, and propensity for solving puzzles also support this field. 

In contrast, while Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work might fit a business administration context, his specific interest in nature, plants, and animals doesn't directly align with the typical characteristics associated with business administration.

Considering these alignments and without precise numerical data, but rather a qualitative assessment based on the given information, we can provide the following probabilistic estimates:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

This implies that, based on his personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
