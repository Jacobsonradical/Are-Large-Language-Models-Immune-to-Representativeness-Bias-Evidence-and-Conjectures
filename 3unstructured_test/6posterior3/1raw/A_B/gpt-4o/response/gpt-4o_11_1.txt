To compute the posterior conditional probabilities that Adam was enrolled in specific fields of study given his personality sketch, we need to utilize Bayes' Theorem. However, since we don't have prior probabilities and exact likelihood values, this will be a qualitative assessment.

Given Adam’s personality sketch—showing curiosity about nature, an appreciation for hard work, high intelligence, empathy, and a deep love for animals—the likelihood of him being in agricultural and veterinary science is much higher than business administration. Business administration typically attracts individuals with a focus on leadership, management, economics, and organizational skills, which don't align as strongly with Adam's described traits.

Here's a reasonable qualitative assessment expressed in terms of probabilities between 0 and 1, where the total does not need to sum to 1:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These probabilities reflect a higher likelihood that Adam's interests and personality traits align with agricultural and veterinary science more than business administration.
