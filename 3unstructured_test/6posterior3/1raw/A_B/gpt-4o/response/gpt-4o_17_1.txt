To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in each given field based on his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context can be stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality traits.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Adam having his personality traits given he is enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality traits.

Since we don't have the exact numerical values for these probabilities, we will make reasoned estimates based on typical characteristics associated with each field of graduate study.

### Business Administration
1. **Likelihood** \( P(B|A) \): Given Adam's personality traits (quiet, enjoys puzzles, empathy, love for animals), the likelihood is not very high because these traits are not typically associated with business administration, which often values outgoing and strategic traits. Let's assume \( P(B|A_{1}) \approx 0.1 \).

2. **Prior** \( P(A_1) \): The popularity of MBA programs is relatively high, so let's assume a moderate value. Let’s say \( P(A_1) \approx 0.2 \).

3. **Overall Probability** \( P(B) \): This will be a normalization factor but since we can't compute individual field-based values precisely, we focus on comparing relative likelihoods. Let's assume a general normalization constant \( P(B) = k \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Likelihood** \( P(B|A) \): Given Adam’s interest in nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood he belongs to agricultural and veterinary science is quite high. Let’s assume \( P(B|A_{2}) \approx 0.8 \).

2. **Prior** \( P(A_2) \): The popularity of these programs is moderate and not as high as business administration, so let's assume \( P(A_2) \approx 0.1 \).

3. **Overall Probability** \( P(B) \): This again will be a normalization factor same as above.

### Calculating the Posterior Probabilities

- For Business Administration \( A_1 \):
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{P(B|A_1) \cdot P(A_1)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{k} = \frac{0.02}{k} \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science \( A_2 \):
\[ P(A_2|B) = \frac{P(B|A_2) \cdot P(A_2)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{k} = \frac{0.08}{k} \]

### Normalizing the Factor \( k \)
\[ k = P(B) \approx 0.02 + 0.08 = 0.1 \]

### Final Posterior Probabilities

- For Business Administration:
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{0.02}{0.1} = 0.2 \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(A_2|B) = \frac{0.08}{0.1} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, based on the given personality sketch, the posterior conditional probabilities can be approximated as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
