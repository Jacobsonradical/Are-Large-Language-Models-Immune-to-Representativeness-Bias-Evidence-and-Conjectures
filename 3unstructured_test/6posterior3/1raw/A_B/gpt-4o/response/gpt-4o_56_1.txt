To compute the posterior probabilities, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be expressed as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

However, since we don't have the exact prior probabilities or likelihoods for each field from Adam's personality description, this result must be interpreted qualitatively based on the provided information.

Adam's personality sketch includes the following key traits:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Based on these characteristics:

- "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" and "a deep love for animals" directly correlate with agricultural and veterinary science.
- "High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts" and "enjoys solving puzzles" might be useful for business administration, but empathy, warmth, and appreciation for nature do not strongly indicate a high probability for the field.
- Empathy and a warm heart are more central to roles that align with working with living beings, such as animals in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given Adam's detailed personality sketch, it seems more probable that he would be working in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These values are qualitative assessments based on the fit between Adam's personality traits and the typical interests and requirements of the given fields. Adamâ€™s personality aligns much more closely with agricultural and veterinary science due to his interests and empathetic nature.
