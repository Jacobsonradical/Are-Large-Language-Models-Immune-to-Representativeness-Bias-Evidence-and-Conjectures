To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of A given B (posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of B given A (likelihood).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of B.

In our context:
- A is the hypothesis that Adam is in a specific field (either "business administration" or "agricultural and veterinary science").
- B is the evidence which is Adam's personality sketch.

Without specific data about the priors (\( P(A) \)) or the likelihoods (\( P(B|A) \)), we'll rely on educated estimates based on Adam's personality traits and how well they align with typical students in each field.

Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it is reasonable to hypothesize that his interests align more closely with "agricultural and veterinary science" than "business administration."

**Assumptions and Reasoning:**
- Students in business administration may value strategic thinking, leadership, and financial acumen. While Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving ability fit, his traits focused on empathy and nature are less aligned.
- Students in agricultural and veterinary science typically have strong interests in nature, plants, animals, and may possess empathy towards living beings—traits that strongly align with Adam's personality sketch.

Let's assume:
- \( P(\text{business administration}) \), the base rate of students in business administration, is moderate but given Adam’s interests, the likelihood \( P(B|\text{business administration}) \) is relatively low.
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \), the base rate of students in this field, may be lower in the general population, but given Adam's interests, the likelihood \( P(B|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is high.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can make a reasonable estimate of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Note: The values are approximations to reflect the significant alignment of Adam's traits with agricultural and veterinary science and the lesser alignment with business administration. The remaining probability is distributed among other possible fields not listed here.
