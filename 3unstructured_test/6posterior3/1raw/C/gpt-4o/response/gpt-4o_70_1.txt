To estimate the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to make some assumptions and use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) to the prior probability \( P(A) \) and the likelihood \( P(B|A) \), where \( A \) is the hypothesis (enrolled in computer science) and \( B \) is the evidence (personality sketch).

Given:
- Personality traits: curious about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, empathetic, loves animals, intelligent, appreciates hard work. 
- Graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.

**Steps:**
1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):** This is the base rate or the likelihood of randomly chosen graduate students being enrolled in computer science. As of the recent trends, let's assume the probability of a graduate student in the U.S. enrolled in computer science is around 0.15 (15%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):** This is the probability of Adamâ€™s personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science. 
   - Enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are highly consistent with computer science.
   - Curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals might be less directly related but do not contradict computer science enrollment. Let's assume this likelihood is moderately high, around 0.7 (70%).

3. **Normalizing Constant \( P(B) \):** This is the probability of observing the personality traits irrespective of the field. Computing this precisely requires data on personality trait distributions across all fields, but we can assume a reasonable distribution of these traits amongst various fields.

Using these assumptions in Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Since the exact \( P(B) \) isn't provided, we normalize our probabilities:

\[ P(computer\_science|personality\_sketch) \propto P(personality\_sketch|computer\_science) \cdot P(computer\_science) \]
\[ P(computer\_science|personality\_sketch) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.15 = 0.105 \]

To normalize, we'd consider similar estimates for other fields Adam might be involved in and sum them.

Assuming computer science might have relatively high alignment with his traits compared to some other fields, we approximate:

{
  **"computer science": 0.39**
}

Here, 0.39 represents the high conditional probability estimate but within range (significantly higher than 0.15) based on traits favouring strength and puzzle-solving alignment to the field.
