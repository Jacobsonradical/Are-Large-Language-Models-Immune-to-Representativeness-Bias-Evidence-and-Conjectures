To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. However, without explicit prior probability distributions and conditional probabilities, we must rely on qualitative assessment. We will base our computation on the nature of Adam's traits and how they might align with a specific field of study.

Adam's traits can be broken down as follows:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants
- Quiet demeanor, enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted with strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence, good at abstract thinking
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Computer Science Traits:
- Curiosity and problem-solving (aligned with his enjoyment of solving puzzles and abstract thinking)
- Requires a certain level of quiet focus and dedication (aligned with his quiet demeanor and appreciation for hard work)
- Typically involves intensive cognitive tasks (aligned with high intelligence)
However, Computer Science does not directly align with his love for nature, plants, and animals, and may not be the most empathetic profession.

Based on these considerations, we can make an educated guess about the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science.

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

This value is based on the partial alignment of his traits with those typically required in Computer Science, although his stronger inclinations toward nature and empathy indicate a potential fit with other fields, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology.
