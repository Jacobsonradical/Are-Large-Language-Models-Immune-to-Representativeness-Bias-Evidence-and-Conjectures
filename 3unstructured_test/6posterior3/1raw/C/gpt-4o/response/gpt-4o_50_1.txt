To estimate the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. This is a simplified application, as actual computation might require detailed prior probabilities and likelihood values that are not specified here. 

**Bayes' theorem states:**

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:

- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of A given B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of B.

Let's define our terms:

- \( A \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( B \): Personality traits of Adam.

### Assigning probabilities based on personality traits:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(A) \)):** This is the probability of a student being enrolled in computer science without any additional information. According to data from universities, suppose about 10% of graduate students are enrolled in computer science.

2. **Likelihood (\( P(B|A) \)):** The likelihood that Adam, given his traits, could be a computer science student. His traits (high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, enjoying solving puzzles) are favorable for someone in computer science. Let's assign a high likelihood here, say 0.7.

3. **Marginal Probability (\( P(B) \)):** This is the overall probability of having the traits described in the sketch. Given Adam's traits are quite broad and could fit multiple fields (including biology, psychology, etc.), let's assign a moderate probability here, say 0.5.

### Computation:

Using the values assigned:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.07}{0.5} \]

\[ P(A|B) = 0.14 \]

### Conclusion:

Thus, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is:
