To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would ideally use Bayesian inference. We need the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each possible field and the likelihood of the personality traits given enrollment in those fields. Without specific numerical data, we'll need to make qualitative assessments.

Firstly, consider the traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence
- Good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

Many of these traits could fit well with various fields of study. However, let's focus on computer science:

1. Enjoying solving puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.
2. Having high intelligence is typically associated with success in challenging fields like computer science.
3. While empathy and a love for animals may not be directly relevant, they do not preclude an interest in computer science.

Considering that personality traits like problem-solving and abstract thinking are conducive to computer science and assuming we don't have compelling evidence linking the other fields more strongly with the given traits, we can assign a reasonable probability.

Given these considerations and in the absence of precise data, we estimate the posterior probability qualitatively. We avoid giving a likelihood close to 0 or 1 in a qualitative situation like this.
