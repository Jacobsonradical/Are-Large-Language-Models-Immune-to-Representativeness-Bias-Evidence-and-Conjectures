To compute the posterior conditional probability, we need to consider Bayes' Theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality traits.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is a computer science student.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Adam is a computer science student.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits.

For an illustrative solution, we need to make some assumptions because we lack specific statistical data. We'll use heuristic reasoning and broad data points based on general knowledge:
1. **Prior Probability ( \( P(A) \) )**: Let's assume the probability of any random graduate student being in computer science is relatively common, say 0.2 (20%).
2. **Likelihood ( \( P(B | A) \) )**: Given Adam's traits, we can argue that his skills align reasonably well with computer science (problem-solving, intelligence, abstract thinking). We might estimate this likelihood at 0.5 (50%).
3. **Marginal Probability ( \( P(B) \) )**: The overall probability of these traits in a graduate student regardless of the field. Adam's traits appear to match several sciences and humanities fields, so we assume a relatively broad match, say 0.25 (25%).

Plugging into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.25} = 0.4 \]

Given these assumptions, the probability is approximately 0.4 (40%).
