To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we first need to consider features of Adam’s personality and how they align with typical characteristics of a computer science student.

Key aspects of Adam’s personality include:
- Interest in nature and plants
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles
- Warmhearted and empathetic
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence
- Good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

In the context of computer science, the enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and good understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators. Computer science often requires problem-solving skills, an ability to work with abstract concepts (like algorithms and data structures), and intelligence.

Clearly, these attributes overlap with common traits found in computer science students. However, Adam’s interest in nature and animals, while not directly related, does not exclude him from being involved in computer science, especially considering interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics or environmental data analysis.

To provide a probability value between 0 and 1, we’ll qualitatively assess these considerations.
Given the significant alignment, we may estimate posterior conditional probability as realistically high, but not certain:
