In order to compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayesian reasoning. However, precise probabilities would require detailed data on the distribution of majors among graduate students with similar personality traits, which we do not have. I'll provide a reasoned estimate based on the given personality sketch and the typical characteristics of students in computer science.

Adam has a curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has empathy and a love for animals, is intelligent, and appreciates hard work. These traits describe someone who could be in a variety of fields, but let's analyze their fit for computer science:

1. **Curiosity (general trait that is present across many fields including computer science)**
2. **Puzzle-solving ability (highly matches computer science)**
3. **Empathy and love for animals (less direct, but could fit into areas like robotics with a focus on social impact, user experience, or fields like bioinformatics)**
4. **High intelligence (key trait for many fields, including computer science)**
5. **Appreciation for hard work (non-specific, but important in rigorous fields including computer science)**

Given these aspects, we can reason that Adam might fit the profile of a computer science graduate student due to his puzzle-solving capabilities and high intelligence, though his love for nature and animals may more commonly direct one towards biology, environmental science, or related fields.

Given these considerations, a rough estimate for the posterior probability would be:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

This value reflects a reasonable likelihood considering that while some traits fit well with computer science, others might be more directly aligned with fields focused on nature or animals.
