To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we should consider how well his described traits align with those typically associated with computer science students. 

From the personality sketch:
- Adam is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which aligns with the skills needed in computer science.
- He has a love for solving puzzles, which is also a strong indicator as it is a common trait for computer science students.
- While he has a deep love for nature, plants, and animals, this is not directly indicative of computer science but does not rule it out either.
- His strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are traits beneficial in any field, including computer science.

Given these points, Adam's traits are supportive but not exclusively indicative of a field in computer science. Therefore, the probability could be considered moderate to high, but not certain.
