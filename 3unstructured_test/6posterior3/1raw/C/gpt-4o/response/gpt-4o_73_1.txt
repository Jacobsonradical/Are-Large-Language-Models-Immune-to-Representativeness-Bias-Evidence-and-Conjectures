To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' theorem. This calculation requires several steps and information about the base rates (prior probabilities) of students enrolled in computer science and the likelihood of certain personality traits given their enrollment in that field. 

However, without specific data on base rates and likelihoods, we can only provide a general subjective estimate based on the provided personality sketch.

Given Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants (interest in biology/natural sciences)
- Enjoys solving puzzles (a trait that could be useful in many fields, including computer science)
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts (relevant to computer science)
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals (suggests interest in potentially softer sciences or fields involving living organisms)
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication (a trait valuable in any field)

Based on these characteristics, Adam's personality appears to align with many traits valued in computer science (e.g., problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts) but also suggests strong interests in natural sciences/biological fields. These factors combined point to a moderate probability that he is in computer science.

Given that we don't have precise data, we provide an estimate taking into account both the alignment and the potential for other interests.
