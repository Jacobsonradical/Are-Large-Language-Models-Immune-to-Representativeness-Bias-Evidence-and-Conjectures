To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to leverage Bayes' theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihood values, we can only provide a qualitative approximation based on the given personality traits.

Let’s analyze the fit of Adam’s personality traits with the field of computer science:
1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants**: This trait doesn't directly align with typical computer science interests, which often involve technology and abstract problem-solving rather than nature.
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**: This trait fits well with typical computer science professions, which often require intense focus and problem-solving abilities.
3. **Warm heart and strong empathy**: While useful in any field, empathy is not particularly highlighted in typical computer science roles, which are more analytical.
4. **Deep love for animals**: This is more indicative of a field like biology or veterinary science.
5. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: This trait is strongly aligned with computer science, which often involves complex and abstract thinking.
6. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This is a universally valuable trait, but it does not provide a specific hint towards computer science.

Considering these points:

- **Positive Indicators for Computer Science** (2 traits): Enjoys solving puzzles, High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- **Neutral/Weak Indicators for Computer Science** (2 traits): Warm heart and strong empathy, Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
- **Negative Indicators for Computer Science** (2 traits): Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, Deep love for animals.

Based on the qualitative analysis, the likelihood of Adam being in computer science can be rated moderately but not high, as his traits are somewhat mixed in their alignment with the field.

Here is a rough estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.4
}

This value represents a moderate likelihood based on Adam's given personality traits and how they map onto typical attributes needed for computer science.
