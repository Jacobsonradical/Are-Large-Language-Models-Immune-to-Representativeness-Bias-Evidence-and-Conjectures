To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality traits, we can use Bayes' Theorem. However, to apply Bayes' Theorem in a rigorous way, we need to have prior probabilities and likelihoods which are not provided directly in the problem. We'll need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the provided information.

Given Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's consider how these traits align with the field of computer science:

1. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This aligns well with computer science, where problem-solving is key.
2. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: These traits are important in computer science due to the abstract nature of algorithms and computational theory.
3. **Curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals**: These traits might not directly align with traditional views of computer science, but they don't necessarily preclude it.

Given the alignment of several key personality traits (solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) with the field of computer science, we can reasonably estimate a moderate conditional probability.

{
  "computer science": 0.6
}

This probability assumes that while a significant number of Adam's traits align with computer science, they do not overwhelmingly suggest it as the sole or most likely field.
