To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider several factors:

1. The general likelihood of someone with Adam's traits being interested in computer science.
2. The base rate of computer science students among all fields of study.

Starting with Adam's traits:
- Curiosity about nature might align more with fields like biology or environmental sciences but can still be relevant for fields like computer science, particularly in areas like computational biology or environmental informatics.
- Enjoying solving puzzles aligns well with computer science, as it involves problem-solving and logical thinking.
- Warm heart and empathy are not direct indicators of computer science but do not preclude it.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators for success in computer science.
- Appreciation for hard work is valuable in any rigorous academic field, including computer science.

Considering these elements, Adam seems like someone who could very well be enrolled in computer science due to the strong alignment of key traits (problem-solving, high intelligence, abstract thinking).

However, we also must factor in the overall base rate of computer science as a chosen field among graduate students in the U.S., which has been fairly significant in recent years.

Taking all this into consideration:

{
  "computer science": 0.6
}

This indicates a moderately high probability, reflecting a reasonable likelihood given his personality and interests.
