To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we should use Bayes' Theorem. However, with the provided information, it's challenging to apply it precisely without specific prior probabilities or a broader population context. Instead, I can provide a qualitative assessment based on the characteristics described and how they intersect with what's typically expected in computer science.

Bayes' Theorem is described as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of being enrolled in computer science given Adam's personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of having Adam's characteristics given enrollment in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of a student being enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of having the characteristics described, regardless of the field of study.

Given Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, and abstract thinking, he possesses traits beneficial in computer science. However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals suggest possible inclinations towards fields like biology, veterinary science, or even psychology.

With the lack of exact statistical data, a rough estimation can be made. Let's propose the following:

- \( P(B|A) \): Traits like enjoyment of puzzles and abstract thinking are common in computer science students; let's estimate this to be relatively high, say 0.7.
- \( P(A) \): Computer science is a common field among graduate students, but not overwhelming; let's assume it to be around 0.2.
- \( P(B) \): The overall probability of possessing Adam's traits among all graduate students; this is less common if we consider his strong empathy and love for nature as a pairing. Let's estimate it moderately, say 0.4.

Applying a simplified, non-rigorous form of Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.4} = 0.35 \]

Hence the posterior conditional probability is:
