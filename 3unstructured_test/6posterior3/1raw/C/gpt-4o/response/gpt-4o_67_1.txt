To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a computer science program given his personality sketch, we can apply Bayesian reasoning.

Here's the format you asked for:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Curiosity about nature and plants**: This suggests a potential interest in biology, environmental science, or botany more than computer science.
- **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This characteristic fits well with computer science.
- **Warm heart, strong empathy**: These traits are generally more emphasized in fields like psychology, social work, or veterinary science.
- **Deep love for animals**: This is more aligned with veterinary science or zoology.
- **High intelligence and good at abstract concepts**: This aligns well with computer science, mathematics, and other STEM fields.
- **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work**: This is a general trait that can be found across many fields.

Given that the traits specifically align better with fields relating to nature, plants, and animals, but some traits also align with computer science (solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts), a reasonable posterior probability for Adam being in computer science, given his personality sketch, is about 0.2.
