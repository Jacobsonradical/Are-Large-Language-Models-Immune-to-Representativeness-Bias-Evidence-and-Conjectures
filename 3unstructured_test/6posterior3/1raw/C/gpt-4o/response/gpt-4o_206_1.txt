To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayesian reasoning. However, without specific prior probabilities or detailed data on how personality traits correlate with enrollment in computer science versus other fields, an exact numerical result cannot be produced. We can, however, make an educated estimate based on typical traits associated with students in different fields.

Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Quiet
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence
- Good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Traits aligning with computer science:
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Strongly aligns
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Strongly aligns
- Quiet: Neutral to positive
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Positive

Traits less aligned with computer science:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants: Leans toward biology or environmental science
- Strong empathy and deep love for animals: Leans toward fields related to biology, zoology, or veterinary studies

Given these observations, while Adam has several traits that could fit someone in computer science, some key interests (nature, plants, animals) suggest other fields might also be a good fit. Therefore, the probability isn't definitive but can be expressed as moderate.

Given these qualitative factors, the estimate of the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is moderate but not exceptionally high.
