To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, it's important to note that we don't have all the necessary information to compute an exact numerical answer (such as prior probabilities or the likelihoods of observing Adam's personality traits in each field). Therefore, we need to rely on logical reasoning based on the given personality traits.

Key considerations:
1. **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: these traits are favorable for studying computer science.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: this aligns well with activities in computer science, like coding and algorithmic problem-solving.
3. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: these traits are beneficial in highly demanding fields, including computer science.
4. **Curiosity about nature and love for animals**: these might generally align more with fields related to environmental science, biology, or zoology rather than computer science.

While Adam's empathy and love for animals do not necessarily point to computer science, other traits favor it. Given the mixed evidence, we might consider a moderate probability rather than an extreme low or high value.

Given this, we can provide a probabilistic estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.4
}

This value reflects a balanced likelihood that fits Adam's profile based on the available information.
