To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, several factors must be considered. These include his attributes and how they align with typical characteristics of computer science students.

Adam's characteristics:
1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**
2. **Quiet demeanor and enjoyment of solving puzzles**
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals**
4. **High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts**
5. **Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication**

Among these traits:
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are highly relevant to computer science, which often involves complex problem-solving and abstract thinking.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns closely with the analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science.
- Quiet demeanor may fit well with the common stereotype of computer science students focusing on individual tasks.

However, characteristics such as a love for nature, empathy, and dedication can be key traits for many other fields besides computer science. Fields such as environmental science, biology, or even psychology may also match well with these interests.

Given the lack of specific information directly linking Adam's curiosity in nature and plants to computer science, and the combination of traits which also align with other fields, the posterior probability is likely not too high but non-negligible. 

Here is the estimated posterior probability:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

This value indicates that while there is a reasonable chance he could be in computer science due to his intelligence, abstract thinking, and propensity for solving puzzles, other fields may be equally or more likely considering his other traits.
