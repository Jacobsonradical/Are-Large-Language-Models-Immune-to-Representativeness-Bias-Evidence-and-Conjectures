To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we must use Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can only provide a subjective estimate based on the information given.

Bayes' Theorem formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is a computer science student.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any given student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits.

### Subjective Estimation:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(A)\)**:
   Universities in the U.S. have a notable proportion of students in computer science, but it's not dominant across all fields. We might assign a moderate prior probability (e.g., 0.2 to 0.3).

2. **Likelihood \(P(B|A)\)**:
   Adam has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract conceptsâ€”all traits common in computer science. So, we might estimate this is reasonably high (e.g., 0.6 to 0.7).

3. **Overall Probability \(P(B)\)**:
   This includes the combined probability of observing Adam's traits across all fields, which is harder to estimate without specific data. Given the competitive nature of graduate programs in general and Adam's fit, we might estimate this at a moderate value (e.g., 0.3 to 0.5).

Combining these subjective estimates,

\[
P(\text{{computer science}}|\text{{personality sketch}}) \approx \frac{(0.6 \text{ to } 0.7) \cdot (0.2 \text{ to } 0.3)}{0.3 \text{ to } 0.5}
\]

Estimated range:
\[
P(\text{{computer science}}|\text{{personality sketch}}) \approx \frac{0.12 \text{ to } 0.21}{0.3 \text{ to } 0.5} \approx 0.24 \text{ to } 0.7
\]

Given the overlap and needing a single value, we might conservatively center our estimate around the midpoint of this range.

\[
P(\text{{computer science}}|\text{{personality sketch}}) \approx 0.4
\]

Thus, our final answer is:

{
  "computer science": 0.4
