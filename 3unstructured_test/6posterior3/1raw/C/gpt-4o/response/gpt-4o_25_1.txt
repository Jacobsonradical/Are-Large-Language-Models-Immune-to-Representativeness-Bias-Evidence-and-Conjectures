Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence and his ability to understand abstract concepts could align well with the field of computer science, his genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong empathy suggest that he might be more inclined towards a field related to environmental science or biology. Hence, the posterior conditional probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is not extremely high, but it is still a considerable option given his intelligence and problem-solving skills.
