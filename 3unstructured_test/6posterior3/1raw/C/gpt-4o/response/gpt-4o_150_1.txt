  "computer science": 0.7
}

Explanation: Given Adam's high intelligence, love for puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, it is reasonable to infer that these traits align well with the field of computer science. Additionally, his empathy and appreciation for hard work can be beneficial in collaborative projects, which are common in computer science. Hence, a posterior probability of 0.7 reflects a substantial likelihood that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
