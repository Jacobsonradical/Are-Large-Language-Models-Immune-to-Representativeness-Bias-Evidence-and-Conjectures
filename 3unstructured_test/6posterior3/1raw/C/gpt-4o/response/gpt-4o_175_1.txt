To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would ideally use Bayesian reasoning. However, due to lack of specific data and priors, I will provide a qualitative estimate based on the description provided:

Adam's characteristics include:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoyment of solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart and strong empathy.
4. Deep love for animals.
5. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
6. Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these characteristics, let's consider their relevance to computer science:
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence are positive indicators for a field that involves problem-solving and abstract thinking, such as computer science.
- Genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a love for animals might typically align more with fields like biology, botany, or environmental science rather than computer science.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals might align with fields involving direct work with living beings, such as veterinary science or environmental studies.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is a neutral trait that could apply broadly across many fields, including computer science.

Based on this qualitative assessment, while there is some alignment with computer science, there are also strong indications that his interests might lead him to different fields. Hence, the probability is best estimated with a conservative value, reflecting the mixed indicators.
