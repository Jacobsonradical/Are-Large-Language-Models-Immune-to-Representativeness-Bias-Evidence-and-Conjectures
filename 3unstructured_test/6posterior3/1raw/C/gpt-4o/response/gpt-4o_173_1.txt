To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which is mathematically given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any random graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

Without specific numerical data on the prior probabilities, I'll make reasoned assumptions to estimate these probabilities:

1. **P(B|A)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in computer science.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science.
   - Quiet nature and problem-solving skills also align with typical traits of computer science students.
   - However, a deep love for animals and strong empathy might be slightly less common but not exclusive to the field.

   Estimate: 0.7

2. **P(A)**: The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
   - Let's assume there are many fields a graduate student might choose. Since computer science is popular but not the majority, let's estimate:

   Estimate: 0.15

3. **P(B)**: The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields.
   - This represents the distribution of Adam-like traits among all graduate students. Given his unique combination of traits, we might consider it relatively rare but not extremely so.

   Estimate: 0.2

Putting these into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{0.2} = \frac{0.105}{0.2} = 0.525 \]

So, the estimated posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is:

{
  "computer science": 0.525
