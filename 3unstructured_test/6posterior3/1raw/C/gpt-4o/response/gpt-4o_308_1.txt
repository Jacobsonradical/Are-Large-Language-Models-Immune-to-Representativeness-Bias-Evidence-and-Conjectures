Based on the information provided, Adam's personality sketch includes qualities such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work. While these traits could be found in a computer science student, they are not necessarily the strongest indicators for this field compared to some others that might align more closely with his interests (e.g., biology, environmental science, or psychology).

However, given his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, which are critical in computer science, there remains a reasonable probability that he could indeed be enrolled in computer science.

Considering these factors, here's the computed posterior conditional probability for computer science:
