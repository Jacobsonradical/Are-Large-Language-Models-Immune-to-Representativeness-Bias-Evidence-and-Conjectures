To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need more specific data or assumptions to base our calculation on. However, given the lack of concrete numerical data, it's reasonable to make an educated guess based on Adam's traits and interests.

1. Adam has a quiet nature and enjoys solving puzzles.
2. Adam has a high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
3. Adam has a strong empathy, deep love for animals, and a curiosity about nature and plants.

Considering these characteristics:
- Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align well with skills needed in computer science.
- However, the strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature could suggest a propensity for fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology.

Given this qualitative analysis without specific numerical data, we can make an informed estimate rather than an exact calculation.

{
  "computer science": "0.5"
}

This estimate combines the alignment in problem-solving and abstract thinking with the possibility that his empathy and interests in nature and animals might lead him into a different field.
