To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we'll use Bayesian inference. Specifically, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam choosing different fields of study, the likelihood of these fields given his personality traits, and then update our beliefs accordingly.

Let's denote:
- \( P(F) \): Prior probability of the field \( F \).
- \( P(S | F) \): Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch \( S \) given the field \( F \).
- \( P(F | S) \): Posterior probability of the field \( F \) given the personality sketch \( S \).

To simplify, we will assume all academic fields to be equally likely at the start (this is a simplifying assumption due to lack of specific prior probabilities).

Given the general nature of Bayesian inference:
\[ P(F | S) = \frac{P(S | F) \cdot P(F)}{P(S)} \]

Since we assumed all fields equally likely initially:
\[ P(F) = \frac{1}{\text{Number of fields considered}} \]

We assess the likelihood \( P(S | F) \) based on how Adam's traits align with characteristics typically seen in students of those fields.

### Analysis

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Pros**: High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles.
   - **Cons**: Doesn't explicitly mention the technological or computational interest.

Given the simplification and considering the traits mentioned:

- Curiosity about nature and plants: Generally low relevance for computer science.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: Generally low relevance but not a deterrent for computer science.
- High intelligence, good with abstract concepts, solving puzzles: High relevance for computer science.

Given these considerations, we expect a moderate-to-high likelihood of Adam’s traits aligning with those typical for a computer science student, but it’s important to note there's lacking direct evidence (e.g., technological interest). Assuming there are other equally considered fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc., we must balance between these.

### Posterior Calculation
For simplicity and illustrative purposes, let’s assume 5 fields equally likely: Computer Science, Biology, Environmental Science, Psychology, and Physics.

Prior:
\[ P(F) = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \]

Considering the likelihood’s rough estimation:
- Computer Science: High intelligence, puzzle solving, abstract concepts align strongly. Say, \( P(S | \text{Computer Science}) = 0.7 \).

Overall normalizing denominator:
\[ P(S) = \sum_{i=1}^{5} P(S | F_i) \cdot P(F_i) \]
Assume other fields like Biology, etc., have more traits aligning generally but less directly with abstract concepts. We may assign likelihoods approximately proportionally and high for those not directly aligned.

\[ \Rightarrow P(S) \approx 0.7 \times 0.2 + 0.5(approximating for other fields...) + \text{others similarly.} \approx 2.7/5 \approx 0.54 \]

Thus using Bayes:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | S) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.54} \approx \frac{0.14}{0.54} \approx 0.26 \]

Thus, the result is an estimated posterior:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.26"
}
```

Remember, this is based on various simplifying assumptions. Detailed specific priors and refined likelihoods or domain knowledge might adjust outcomes.
