To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, we can use a qualitative Bayesian approach. However, without precise numerical values and prior probabilities, we will provide a reasoned estimation.

First, let's consider the likelihood that an individual with Adam's traits would choose computer science:

1. **Interest in nature and plants**: This might not heavily lean towards computer science but doesn't rule it out.
2. **Enjoyment of solving puzzles**: This is a strong indicator for computer science, as the field involves a lot of problem-solving.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals**: These traits could lead someone towards a field like biology, veterinary science, or environmental science, but computer science isn't ruled out completely if they apply these attributes in ways like developing software for animal conservation or environmental monitoring.
4. **High intelligence and abstract thinking**: These traits are very well aligned with computer science, as the field often requires high-level abstract thinking.
5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This is a neutral point but beneficial in any rigorous field like computer science.

Given these considerations, while some traits (like empathy and love for animals) might suggest other fields, the traits of enjoying solving puzzles and high intelligence with abstract thinking strongly support the likelihood of choosing computer science.

Considering a balanced perspective and without exact prior and likelihood values, we can qualitatively estimate the posterior probability. A more precise calculation would require exact numbers for Bayesian updating.

Assuming a moderate prior probability that a graduate student might be in computer science, we adjust it upwards based on his trait match for certain aspects of computer science.

  "computer science": 0.6

This value of 0.6 reflects that while Adam has a strong alignment with problem-solving and abstract thinking critical to computer science, there are significant elements in his personality sketch that could lead him to consider other fields as well.
