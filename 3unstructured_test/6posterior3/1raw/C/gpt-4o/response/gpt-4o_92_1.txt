To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, it's important to note that without specific prior probability distributions and a more rigorous data analysis, this will be a qualitative assessment rather than a precise quantitative one. 

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability of observing Adamâ€™s personality traits in graduate students.

Given Adam's interests and personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants,
- Enjoys solving puzzles,
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts,
- Strong empathy and love for animals,
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication,

Personality-wise, Adam's love for nature and animals might lean toward fields like biology or environmental science, while his puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could be relevant for computer science.

Given these considerations, we might qualitatively estimate that the likelihood of his traits fitting into computer science is moderate. Since data about exact population statistics in different fields isn't provided, the answer is somewhat speculative. 

Based on these qualitative considerations, here's the estimated posterior probability:
