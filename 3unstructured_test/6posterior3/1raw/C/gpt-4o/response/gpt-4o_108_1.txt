To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, because we don't have specific prior probabilities or likelihoods for each field based on his traits, I'll offer a qualitative assessment instead of a precise numerical answer.

Adam's personality sketch indicates:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm-hearted and empathetic.
4. Deep love for animals.
5. High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
6. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

While some of these traits align with fields such as environmental science, biology, or zoology, others suggest an inclination toward fields that involve solving complex problems and understanding abstract concepts, which could include computer science.

Computer science generally attracts individuals who:
- Enjoy solving puzzles and complex problems.
- Have high intelligence and a propensity for abstract thinking.
- Appreciate hard work and dedication.

Given these considerations, the probability is qualitative and heuristic, but it aligns with the typical traits of individuals in computer science.

Therefore:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

This value reflects a moderate likelihood that Adam could be enrolled in computer science given the personality traits detailed, particularly his problem-solving skills and intelligence, albeit with consideration of other possible fields that match his strong empathy and love for nature and animals.
