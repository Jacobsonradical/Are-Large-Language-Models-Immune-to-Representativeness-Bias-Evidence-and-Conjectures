To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities or additional data, we can only make a qualitative assessment.

Given the information:
- Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He enjoys solving puzzles, which is common among computer science students.
- A deep love for nature, empathy, and a warm heart, which may not be strongly related to computer science.

While aspects like high intelligence and puzzle-solving align with common traits in computer science students, his love for nature and empathy might suggest fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. 

Given this qualitative assessment:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

Note: This is a subjective estimate based on the personality traits provided without additional data or specific prior probability information.
