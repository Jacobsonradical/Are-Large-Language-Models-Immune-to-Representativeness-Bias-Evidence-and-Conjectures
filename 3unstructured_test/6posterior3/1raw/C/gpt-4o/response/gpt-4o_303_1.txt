To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch and the provided information, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. However, without the actual probability distributions and data, I can provide a reasoned qualitative estimate based on the personality traits described.

Given Adam's attributes such as high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, solving puzzles, quiet nature, and curiosity about nature, he could very well be in a field like computer science. Yet, his deep love for animals and strong empathy might also suggest fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies instead. Therefore, without explicit probabilities, a reasoned estimate can be given based on general likelihoods.

Since computer science does align well with attributes such as high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and solving puzzles, but might not align as perfectly with his deep love for animals and empathy, I'll provide a balanced estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

This value of 0.4 reflects that while computer science is a reasonable possibility given his traits, other fields might also be plausible choices based on his personality sketch.
