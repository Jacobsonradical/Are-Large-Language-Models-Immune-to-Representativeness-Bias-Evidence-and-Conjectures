To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, we would typically use Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we cannot calculate an exact value. Instead, we can offer a qualitative assessment based on the described traits and typical fields of study.

Adam's traits include intelligence, the ability to understand abstract concepts, an appreciation for hard work, and a love for puzzles. These characteristics align well with fields that include analytical thinking and problem-solving, such as computer science. On the other hand, his genuine curiosity about nature and plants as well as empathy and love for animals might also suggest suitability for fields such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies. 

Nevertheless, given he enjoys solving puzzles and is good at abstract thinking, as well as his intelligence, there is a reasonable likelihood that he could be enrolled in computer science.

Given these qualitative associations, a heuristic probability estimate might be reasonable to provide:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This value is indicative and should not be considered exact, reflecting the balance between his diverse interests and the relevance to the field of computer science.
