Calculating the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on his personality sketch involves a degree of subjective judgment, but we can make some reasonable assumptions based on the given information. 

Adam is described as having high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, both of which are important traits for success in computer science. However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature might lean more towards fields such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies.

Given these mixed signals, we can still estimate a reasonable probability:

- High intelligence and abstract thinking: This supports enrollment in computer science.
- Empathy and love for animals: This might steer towards life sciences or similar fields.
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Could suggest fields like botany or ecology.

Balancing these factors, I would estimate the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch as moderately possible but not the most likely field.
