  "computer science": 0.15
}

While the sketch of Adam's personality does align with traits that can be found in computer science students, such as high intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, his strong empathy, love for nature and animals, and focus on enjoying these aspects point more towards fields related to natural sciences, biology, or environmental studies. Therefore, the probability isn't zero, but it's not overwhelmingly high either. Taking these factors into account, I estimate the conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science to be around 0.15.
