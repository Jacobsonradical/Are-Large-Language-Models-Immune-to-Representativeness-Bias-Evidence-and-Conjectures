To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, it is necessary to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.

However, without specific statistical data on the distribution of personalities across various fields of study and their enrollment probabilities, any computation would be speculative. Consequently, an informed estimation will need to substitute precise values:

1. **Estimate of P(B|A):** People in computer science often possess high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, which align with elements of Adam's personality sketch. However, strong empathy, a warm heart, and a deep love for animals may be less typical in this field.
2. **Estimate of P(A):** Computer science is a relatively common graduate field.
3. **Estimate of P(B):** This personality sketch could fit other fields reasonably well (e.g., biology, environmental science).

Based on the provided information:

1. **P(B|A):** Let's assign this a moderate value, say 0.5.
2. **P(A):** Assume the prior probability is moderate, reflecting the commonality of Computer Science among graduate fields, say 0.2.
3. **P(B):** This is harder to quantify without knowing other similar fields, but we can assume it to encompass a variety of suitable fields. Letâ€™s estimate it at 0.5.

Using these values:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.5} \]

\[ = 0.2 \]

Thus, the posterior probability:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

This model balancing intuition and estimated likely distributions, of course, relies on plausible yet rough assumptions.
