To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would need to approach this through Bayesian inference. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, it is challenging to compute an exact numerical probability. Instead, I can provide a reasoned qualitative assessment based on the information provided:

Adam has a high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are qualities that align well with the field of computer science. Additionally, his enjoyment of solving puzzles is also indicative of an aptitude for computer science. However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature and its plants might suggest interests in fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to any field.

Given these considerations and trying to balance the evidence, the posterior conditional probability Adam was enrolled in computer science might not be extremely high but is still plausible.

Based on this qualitative assessment:
