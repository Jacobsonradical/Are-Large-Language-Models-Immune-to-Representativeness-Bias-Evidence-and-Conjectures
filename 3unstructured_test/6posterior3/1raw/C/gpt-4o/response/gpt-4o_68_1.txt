Explanation: Adam's interest in nature, animals, and plants, along with his deep empathy and love for solving puzzles, suggests he might be more inclined towards a field like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies rather than computer science. However, his high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts could potentially fit the profile for a computer science student, though it seems less probable given the other aspects of his personality sketch. Consequently, I would assign a relatively lower posterior probability to Adam being enrolled in computer science.
