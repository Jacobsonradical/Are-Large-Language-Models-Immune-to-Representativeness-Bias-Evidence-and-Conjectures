To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider a few factors related to his traits and interests:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants**: This may not directly correlate with computer science but indicates a propensity towards fields that involve exploration and understanding.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This is a strong indicator for computer science, as it often involves problem-solving and analytical thinking.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals**: These traits are generally associated with fields that involve caregiving or environmental work. However, they do not exclude the possibility of being in computer science.
4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: This is a strong indicator for computer science since the field often requires a high level of abstract thinking and intellectual capability.
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This applies broadly across many fields, including computer science.

Given these considerations, Adam's traits align well with someone who could be in computer science, particularly due to his problem-solving abilities and high intelligence. However, his strong empathy and love for animals suggest a lower but non-negligible probability of him being in a field directly related to these interests.

Taking all these into account subjectively without a precise Bayesian framework to work with statistical probabilities, we can moderately favor the likelihood of him being in computer science but not overwhelmingly so.
