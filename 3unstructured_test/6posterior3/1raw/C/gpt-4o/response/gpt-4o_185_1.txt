To compute the posterior conditional probability for Adam's enrollment in computer science given his personality sketch, we'd generally use methods rooted in Bayesian probability. However, such computations typically require prior probabilities and likelihoods that aren't provided in this scenario.

Instead, we can make an educated guess based on the information available:

1. Adam has a high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, traits that are beneficial for computer science.
2. He enjoys solving puzzles, which also aligns well with the problem-solving aspect of computer science.
3. His strong appreciation for hard work and dedication is important in any challenging academic field, including computer science.

However, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for plants, and animals might suggest a stronger inclination towards fields such as biology, environmental science, or related areas rather than computer science.

Based on this information, we can assign a subjective probability to the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in computer science, even though this cannot be a precise estimation without more data.
