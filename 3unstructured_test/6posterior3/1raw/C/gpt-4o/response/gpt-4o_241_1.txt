In order to compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics align with typical traits of computer science students. 

Traits that might align with a computer science student based on Adam's description include:

1. Enjoys solving puzzles – indicative of problem-solving skills important in computer science.
2. High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts – beneficial for understanding complex algorithms and computational theories.
3. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication – essential for persevering through challenging coursework and projects.

However, some aspects of his personality sketch that do not strongly align with traditional computer science stereotypes include:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants – suggests an interest more in biology or environmental sciences.
2. Deep love for animals – could indicate a potential fit in veterinary sciences or zoology.

Given these considerations and the provided information, I will assign a reasonably high probability to the field of computer science while acknowledging the mixed alignment.
