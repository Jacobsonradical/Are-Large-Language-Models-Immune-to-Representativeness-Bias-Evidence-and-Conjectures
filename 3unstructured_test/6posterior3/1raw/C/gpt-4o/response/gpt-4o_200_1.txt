To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider factors that would affect this probability. Here's the analysis:

1. **Curiosity About Nature and Plants**: This attribute might be less directly related to computer science compared to fields such as biology, botany, or environmental science.

2. **Enjoys Solving Puzzles**: This trait aligns well with computer science, as problem-solving and analytical skills are crucial in this field.

3. **Warm Heart, Strong Empathy, Deep Love for Animals**: These characteristics may align more with fields related to life sciences, social work, or psychology rather than computer science.

4. **High Intelligence and Understanding Abstract Concepts**: These traits are positively correlated with success in computer science, which often involves abstract thinking.

5. **Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication**: This trait is generally positive and applicable to many fields including computer science.

Given these considerations, although several traits do match well with computer science, some significant traits suggest other fields might be a better fit. Considering a balanced perspective on the probabilistic nature of personality traits aligning with computer science, we might come up with a moderate probability.

Based on this qualitative assessment, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science could reasonably be computed as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

This value reflects that while Adam has several traits conducive to success in computer science, there is also a significant probability that other fields could align better with his interests and personality.
