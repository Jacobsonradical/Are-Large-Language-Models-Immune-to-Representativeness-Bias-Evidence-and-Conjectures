  "computer science": 0.3

Explanation: Adam's personality sketch suggests he has a strong affinity for nature, solving puzzles, and abstract concepts, which could align with many fields. However, computer science requires high intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving skills, making it plausible but not overwhelmingly likely given the equal affinity towards nature-focused fields. Hence, the conditional probability is estimated at 0.3.
