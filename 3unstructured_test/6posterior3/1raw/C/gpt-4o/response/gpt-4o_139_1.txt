To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would typically need to apply Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. However, without the actual prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can't provide a precise numerical value between 0 and 1.

We can, however, perform a qualitative assessment based on the information given. Let's consider the following factors:

1. **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts** are traits that are beneficial in computer science.
2. **Genuine curiosity and enjoyment in solving puzzles** are also aligned with typical interests of those in the field of computer science.
3. **Empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication** are less directly related but could indicate a well-rounded individual who might also appreciate the collaborative and innovative aspects of computer science.

Given this qualitative analysis, we can infer that there's a reasonable likelihood that Adam might have been enrolled in computer science.

However, without exact data, assigning a precise posterior probability is speculative. If we must provide a value, we can express it as a subjective estimate based on the qualitative match:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Here, 0.6 indicates a relatively high probability, reflecting the alignment between Adam's personality traits and those commonly beneficial in computer science.
