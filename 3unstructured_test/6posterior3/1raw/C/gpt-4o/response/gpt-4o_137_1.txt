To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we don't have enough statistical data to provide an exact figure. However, we can perform a qualitative assessment based on his traits. Here's a reasoned qualitative analysis:

- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with the skills needed for computer science.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles could indicate an aptitude for problem-solving, which is essential in computer science.
- A love for nature, empathy, and warm-heartedness are not necessarily related to computer science directly, but they're not contraindications either.

Given this qualitative analysis, I'll provide a reasonable estimate based on the alignment of his personality traits with typical attributes beneficial for success in computer science.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This estimated value of 0.6 reflects a moderate likelihood that Adam could be enrolled in computer science, given his skills in abstract thinking and problem-solving.
