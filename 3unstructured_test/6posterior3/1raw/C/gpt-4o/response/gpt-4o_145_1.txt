To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to estimate how well Adam's traits align with the typical traits of a computer science graduate student.

### Key Traits that Align with Computer Science:
1. **High Intelligence**: Computer science often requires strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
2. **Enjoys Solving Puzzles**: This aligns well with the logical, problem-solving nature of computer science.
3. **Understanding Abstract Concepts**: A crucial skill for understanding complex algorithms and theoretical computation.

### Traits with Neutral or Negative Impact on Aligning with Computer Science:
1. **Genuine Curiosity about Nature and its Various Plants**: Though not directly aligned with computer science, this trait shows a broader intellectual curiosity.
2. **Quiet and Empathetic**: While these traits are not specific to computer science, they are common among many fields.

Given the alignment of critical traits, we can reasonably estimate the posterior probability:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

This value signifies that Adam's traits align strongly but not exclusively with someone likely to be enrolled in a computer science program.
