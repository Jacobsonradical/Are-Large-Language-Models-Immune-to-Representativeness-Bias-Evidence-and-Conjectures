Explanation: Adam's personality sketch indicates a high level of intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts, which are critical traits for success in computer science. Additionally, his love for solving puzzles aligns well with the problem-solving aspects of computer science. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy might point him towards fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. While it's still quite possible for Adam to be enrolled in computer science, given his broader interests, the probability is estimated to be moderate, around 0.3.
