To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider both the characteristics described in Adam’s personality sketch and how they might align with typical characteristics of students in different academic fields, including computer science.

Key aspects of Adam’s personality sketch that could be particularly relevant include:
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits are quite compatible with a field like computer science, which often requires strong problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, and a dedication to hard work.

However, Adam also has a deep love for nature, plants, and animals, which might suggest a natural sciences or biology-related field as well.

Given these considerations, let's assign a reasonable posterior probability based on these factors:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

This reflects an assessment where Adam's characteristics are relatively well-suited for computer science, but also acknowledges the potential for other related scientific fields that fit his personality sketch.
