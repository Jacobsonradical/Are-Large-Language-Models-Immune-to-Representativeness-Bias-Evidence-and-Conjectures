To calculate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a computer science program given his personality sketch, we utilize Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality traits.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Adam having his personality traits given that he is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality traits.

To solve this, we need estimated values or reasonable assumptions for these probabilities. 

Assume:
- P(A): The proportion of graduate students in computer science (CS). Let's estimate this at 20%, or 0.2, as it's a common field.
- P(B|A): The probability of having Adam's personality traits given he is in computer science. CS students often enjoy solving puzzles and may have a high intelligence. However, empathy and a love for nature and animals aren't explicitly aligned with a CS stereotype. Estimating this at around 0.3 seems reasonable.
- P(B): The probability of Adam's personality traits regardless of field. Given these traits aren't confined to any specific field and considering numerous students may exhibit them. We estimate this around 0.1.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.1} = \frac{0.06}{0.1} = 0.6 \]

So, in the specified format:

  "computer science": "0.6"
