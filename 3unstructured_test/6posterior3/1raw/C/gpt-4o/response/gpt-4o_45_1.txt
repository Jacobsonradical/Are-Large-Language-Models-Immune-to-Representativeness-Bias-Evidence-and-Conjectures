To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics align with the typical attributes and interests of a computer science student. We will base our evaluation on qualitative reasoning rather than strict mathematical probability due to insufficient statistical data.

Key characteristics that could relate to the field of computer science:
1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**: This trait doesn't directly align with computer science but suggests a love for discovery.
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**: This aligns well with computer science, as programming and algorithm design often involve puzzle-like problem-solving skills.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals**: These are not typical indicators of a computer science student but show a compassionate side which, while not for or against, doesnâ€™t weigh heavily in the decision.
4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: This is strongly aligned with computer science as the field involves abstract thinking, algorithms, and complex problem solving.
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This is a universal trait beneficial to any discipline and aligns well with the demands of computer science.

With the strongest supportive indicators being his puzzle-solving skills and abstract thinking capabilities, we can reasonably infer a moderate likelihood of Adam being in computer science.

Based on this analysis, let's assign a posterior probability to the field of computer science:
