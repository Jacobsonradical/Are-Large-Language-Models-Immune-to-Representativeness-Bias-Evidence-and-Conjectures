To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would ideally need a comprehensive dataset of students, their fields of study, and their personality traits. However, given the information provided, we can make an educated estimate based on the compatibility of his personality traits with the field of computer science.

Traits like high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and appreciation for hard work can be strongly aligned with the field of computer science. However, his deep love for animals and curiosity about nature and plants might suggest interests in biology or environmental science. 

Given this mixed alignment with computer science and other potential fields, let's consider a balanced approach:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

This estimate reflects a moderate likelihood that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given both his analytical strengths and interests that might align with other scientific fields.
