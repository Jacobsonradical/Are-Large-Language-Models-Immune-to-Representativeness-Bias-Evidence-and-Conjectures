To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, let's break down the information provided. We’ll take a qualitative approach given that precise numerical data isn’t available.

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants**:
   - Fields strongly related: Biology, Environmental Science, Botany.
   
2. **Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles**:
   - Fields related: Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering, Physics.
   
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals**:
   - Fields strongly related: Veterinary Science, Zoology, Animal Behavior, Environmental Science.
   
4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**:
   - Fields related: Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering, Physics, Philosophy.

5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**:
   - Fields related: Any highly demanding academic field (most postgraduate studies require this).

While Adam’s traits match several fields, the alignment with “enjoys solving puzzles,” “high intelligence,” and “good at understanding abstract concepts” are notably associated with computer science. His empathy and warmth might be less directly related to computer science but they don't negate the possibility, as social aspects and interdisciplinary applications can be part of modern computer science.

Considering the overlap with relevant traits for computer science and other fields, but acknowledging the concrete traits aligning well with computer science, we can estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.5
}

This represents a moderate association given the data provided. However, it should be noted that without more specific context, this estimate remains qualitative.
