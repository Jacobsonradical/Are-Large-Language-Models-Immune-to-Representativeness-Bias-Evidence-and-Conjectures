To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would typically use Bayes' theorem. The theorem is stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of event \( A \) (Adam being in computer science) given event \( B \) (Adam's personality sketch).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of event \( B \) given event \( A \).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event \( A \).
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of event \( B \).

However, we lack the exact probabilities for \( P(B|A) \), \( P(A) \), and \( P(B) \) in this context. Therefore, we can only provide a qualitative estimation based on typical characteristics associated with computer science students and Adam's personality sketch.

Given Adam's high intelligence, strong understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, he fits well into the profile of someone who might be studying computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals might slightly hint towards a field like biology or environmental science. 

Nevertheless, many people in computer science also have diverse interests, including nature and animals. Thus, taking these factors into account:

This estimation implies that while there is a reasonably good chance Adam could be studying computer science given his analytical nature and intelligence, his strong empathy and love for nature slightly reduce the certainty.
