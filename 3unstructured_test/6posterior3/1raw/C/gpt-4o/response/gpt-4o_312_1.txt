To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would typically use Bayes' Theorem. 

However, in the absence of detailed statistical data about prior probabilities (how common graduate students are in various fields), likelihoods (how likely individuals with Adam's personality would choose various fields), and normalizing constants, we can only make a qualitative assessment. 

Given Adam's high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and appreciation for abstract concepts, he might be well-suited for computer science. His empathy and love for nature and animals, while not directly related to computer science, do not preclude it. However, other fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine might seem more aligned based on his empathy and love for animals. 

Despite this, many computer science professionals have diverse interests, and the field itself offers the flexibility to combine computing with other interests (e.g., bioinformatics, environmental modeling). Based on this qualitative assessment:
