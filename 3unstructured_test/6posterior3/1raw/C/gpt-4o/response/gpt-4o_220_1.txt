To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would ideally use Bayes' Theorem. While exact probabilities often require detailed prior distributions and likelihoods, let's consider the elements from the sketch that might correlate with a field like computer science.

Adam's relevant traits:
- High intelligence
- Good at understanding abstract concepts
- Enjoys solving puzzles

These traits are quite strongly associated with success in computer science. However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals might align more closely with fields like biology or environmental science rather than computer science per se.

Given this mixed profile and assuming that he could fit into either category but perhaps with a slight lean towards natural sciences due to his emotional and empathetic characteristics, we might posit a modest probability for computer science.

Here is a plausible posterior probability value:

{
  "computer science": 0.4
}

This probability indicates a reasonable chance that Adam's attributes fit within the domain of computer science, though not overwhelmingly so due to the significant emphasis on characteristics related to nature and empathy.
