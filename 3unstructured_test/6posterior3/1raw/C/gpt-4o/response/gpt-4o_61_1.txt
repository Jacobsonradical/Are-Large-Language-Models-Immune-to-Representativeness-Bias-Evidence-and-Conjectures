To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(Field | Sketch) = \frac{P(Sketch | Field) \cdot P(Field)}{P(Sketch)} \]

Where:
- \( P(Field | Sketch) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(Sketch | Field) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in computer science.
- \( P(Field) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(Sketch) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

For simplicity, we will make reasonable assumptions about the probabilities based on typical characteristics of students in various fields:

1. **P(Sketch | Computer Science):** Computer science students often have high intelligence, enjoy solving puzzles, and can appreciate abstract concepts. Assuming a probability of 0.6.
2. **P(Computer Science):** The prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science. Let's assume it's reasonably high due to the prevalence of the field, such as 0.2.
3. **P(Sketch):** The overall probability of the personality sketch. This is tricky but can be seen as an aggregate of probabilities across all fields Adam might be in. Let's assume it to be the average, considering many fields, 0.5.

Using these assumptions:
\[ P(Field | Sketch) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.12}{0.5} = 0.24 \]

Thereby, we conclude:
