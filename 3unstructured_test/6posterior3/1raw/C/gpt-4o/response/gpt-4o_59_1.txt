To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, we would typically apply Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific base rates or further context, we can only provide a subjective estimation based on the personality sketch provided.

Hereâ€™s an interpretation of Adam's suitability for computer science:
- His interest in solving puzzles and intelligence suggests he might have an aptitude for computer science.
- His quiet demeanor may indicate a preference for individual or focused work, which is common in computer science fields.
- However, his deep love for nature, animals, and empathetic qualities might suggest he could be drawn to fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology.

Given these considerations, we can propose a reasonable, though non-empirical, estimate.

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This value tries to balance his technical skills and interest in problem-solving with his empathy and love for nature, suggesting there is some likelihood but recognizing other fields might be equally or more probable based on the description provided.
