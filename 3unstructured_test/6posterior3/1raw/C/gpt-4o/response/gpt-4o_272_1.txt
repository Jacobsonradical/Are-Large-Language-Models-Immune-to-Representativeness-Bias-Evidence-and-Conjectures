To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities or more detailed information, we will have to rely on some logical assumptions based on the given personality sketch.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Prior Probability (P(computer science))**: We assume a general prior probability that a student could be enrolled in computer science. This could be based on the fact that computer science is a common field of study among graduate students.

2. **Likelihood (P(Personality Sketch | computer science))**: We need to estimate how likely someone with Adam's interests and personality traits would be to study computer science.

Given Adam's strong intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and quiet nature, these traits align well with what is often seen in computer science students. However, his strong curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work typically associated with empirical tasks, and deep love for animals might suggest fields such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies. 

3. **Evidence (P(Personality Sketch))**: This is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch in any grad student, regardless of their field.

Using these components:

**P(computer science | Personality Sketch) = [P(Personality Sketch | computer science) * P(computer science)] / P(Personality Sketch)**

Without exact numerical values, we can provide a plausible estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This estimate takes into account the likelihood that Adam's intellectual traits align well with computer science while also recognizing that some of his other traits might lead him to other fields.
