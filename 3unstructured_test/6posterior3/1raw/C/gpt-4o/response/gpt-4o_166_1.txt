To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to analyze how well his traits and interests align with what is typically expected in that field. 

A Bayesian approach would require prior probabilities and likelihood ratios, but we'll use a qualitative analysis approach due to lack of specific numerical data. 

Traits and Interests:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants - Not closely related to computer science, more aligned with biology or environmental science.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles - A good fit for computer science, as it involves problem-solving.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals - Not specifically related to computer science but doesn't rule it out.
4. High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts - Strongly related to computer science.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication - Applicable to any field but definitely relevant to computer science.

Given these considerations, there are some traits that align well with computer science (solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts), while others (curiosity about nature and plants) might suggest different fields. 

Although there's no precise data, let's estimate the posterior probability:
