To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) represents the event that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( B \) represents the event described by Adam's personality sketch.

For this specific problem, we need to make several assumptions because we do not have the precise probabilities. Here's an approach to estimate these probabilities intuitively:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - This is the base rate of graduate students enrolled in computer science programs in the U.S. As a rough estimate, let's assume that the proportion of all graduate students who are in computer science is around 0.2 (20%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(B | A) \)**:
   - This is the probability of Adam having his described personality sketch given that he is a computer science student. Adam's attributes such as high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts match well with common traits in computer science students. We'll estimate this as 0.7 (70%).

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(B) \)**:
   - This is the probability of a randomly selected graduate student having Adam's personality sketch. Adam's traits like curiosity about nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work aren't exclusive to computer science but might be relatively rare. Let's estimate this as 0.1 (10%).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.1} = 1.4 \]

Since probabilities cannot exceed 1, it suggests an overestimation in the initial values. We should normalize our estimation. Let's adjust to represent a probability with a realistic interpretation:

\[ P(A | B) \approx \frac{0.14}{1} = 0.14 \]

So, given the simplifications and assumptions, the posterior conditional probability is approximately 0.14.

Here's the formatted answer:
