To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider the likelihood of the given traits fitting within someone studying computer science.

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants - Typically associated with biology, botany, or environmental science, but intellectual curiosity is also valuable in computer science.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles - Common trait in computer science.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals - More indicative of veterinary studies, animal science, or environmental fields, but empathy and warmth can be beneficial in user-centric areas of computer science like HCI (Human-Computer Interaction).
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts - These are crucial for computer science.
5. Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication - Useful in any field, including computer science.

Given these considerations, the likelihood of Adam being in computer science is affected by his problem-solving skills and his ability to understand abstract concepts. Although his empathy and love for animals aren't directly related to computer science, they don’t rule it out either. Adam’s high intelligence and the traits that align with problem-solving and abstract thinking positively support the field of computer science.

A prior probability based on general knowledge of graduate student fields would help refine this estimate, but given only the personality sketch, here is a reasoned estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This value indicates a reasonable probability (but not a certainty) that Adam could be a computer science student based on the given personality traits.
