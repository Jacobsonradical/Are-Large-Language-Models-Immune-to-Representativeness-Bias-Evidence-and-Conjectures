To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:  
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of having Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of having Adam's personality sketch, regardless of his field.

Assuming generic distributions without specific data:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(A) \))**: For simplification, let's assume equal prior probability for any graduate field major among a spectrum of common fields (e.g., Computer Science, Biology, Psychology, etc.). Say we have 5 common fields \(\Rightarrow P(A) = 1/5 = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood (\( P(B|A) \))**: This represents the probability of Adam having such a personality if he was in computer science. Given Adam's attributes like high intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts, this might be moderately likely but not very high due to his strong inclination towards nature, empathy, and animals, which are less characteristic of computer science students. Let's estimate this at 0.4.

3. **Total Probability (\( P(B) \))**: This is the normalization factor and can be a sum of the likelihoods over all possible fields. Given 5 possible fields:
   - Computing a rough estimate:
     - Computer Science: 0.4
     - Biology (given curiosity about nature and plants): 0.8
     - Psychology (given empathy and warmth): 0.6
     - Environmental Science: 0.7
     - Veterinary Studies (given love for animals): 0.7

   \[\Rightarrow P(B) \approx \frac{0.4 + 0.8 + 0.6 + 0.7 + 0.7}{5} = 0.64\]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.64} = 0.125 \]

This results in our final estimate output.
