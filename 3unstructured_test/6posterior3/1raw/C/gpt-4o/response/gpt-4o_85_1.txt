To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, we could theoretically apply Bayes' theorem if we had all the necessary prior and likelihood probabilities. However, due to limited data available in the problem, we will instead provide a qualitative estimate based on the given personality traits.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, love for animals, and the traits of being quiet, enjoying puzzles, having high intelligence, and appreciating hard work and dedication, it seems he might be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or a similar area rather than computer science.

However, his appreciation for solving puzzles and high intelligence might still make him a candidate for computer science. Given these considerations, we'll provide a subjective estimate.

This value is not precisely calculated and relies on a qualitative assessment based on the personality traits described.
