To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we'll use a form of Bayesian inference. However, for this exercise, we will make some simplified assumptions, as we do not have access to specific prior probabilities or conditional probabilities.

From the personality sketch of Adam:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart, strong empathy, a love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciates hard work and dedication.

Relevant inferred traits for computer science:
- Enjoys solving puzzles: This aligns well with computer science, which often involves problem-solving.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: These traits are commonly associated with success in computer science.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: This is a trait that would be beneficial in computer science.

Less relevant traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals may not directly align with computer science, although they do not rule it out.

Considering the above factors and given that we don't have concrete statistical data, we will make an educated estimation. Based on the traits directly aligning and considering the field's broad applicability, we'll estimate the posterior conditional probability.

{
  "computer science": 0.6
}

This value reflects a reasonable probability that Adam could be enrolled in computer science given the traits described, emphasizing his problem-solving skills, intellectual capacity, and dedication.
