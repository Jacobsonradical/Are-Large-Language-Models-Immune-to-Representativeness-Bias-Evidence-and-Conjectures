To calculate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to proceed through several steps, typically involving Bayes' theorem. While detailed quantifiable data on the likelihoods (prior probabilities, likelihoods, etc.) is not provided, I'll consider some qualitative aspects to make a reasoned estimation.

Adam exhibits characteristics such as:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet demeanor with a love for solving puzzles
- Warmth, empathy, and love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Here are key points to consider:
- Interest in nature and plants might align more with biological sciences.
- Puzzle-solving aligns well with fields like mathematics and computer science.
- Empathy and love for animals point towards fields like biology, veterinary science, or environmental science.
- High intelligence and abstract thinking would be valuable in computer science, data science, mathematics, etc.
- Appreciation for hard work is a generally good trait but not field-specific.

Considering these aspects:
- His love for solving puzzles and high intelligence points strongly towards fields that involve problem-solving and abstract thinking, such as computer science.
- His curiosity about nature may add some weight towards biological fields but doesnâ€™t rule out computer science.
- Empathy and love for animals could apply broadly and do not significantly sway the probability towards or away from computer science.

Given these considerations, I would estimate a reasonably high, but not certain probability for computer science, considering the alignment of his high intelligence and problem-solving interests.

Thus, a reasonable estimation might be:

  "computer science": 0.6
