To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider several key factors from the provided information:

1. **Personality Traits**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These characteristics are highly compatible with someone studying computer science.

2. **Curiosity about Nature and Animals**: This curiosity might suggest a leaning toward fields such as biology, zoology, or environmental science. However, this does not necessarily exclude computer science, especially if Adam is interested in areas like bioinformatics, ecological modeling, or machine learning applications in environmental data.

3. **Empathy and Warm Heart**: These traits are valuable in any field. While not exclusively indicative of computer science, they do not preclude it either. 

4. **Graduate Student in the U.S. in 2021**: With the significant presence and popularity of computer science programs in the U.S., it's reasonable to consider the base rate for enrollment in computer science graduate programs.

Considering these factors and attempting to quantify them into a posterior probability between 0 and 1 without explicit quantitative data, I'll make a reasoned estimate. The essential compatibility of his traits with computer science and the popularity of the field make it plausible. However, since his curiosity and empathy might point toward other fields as well, the posterior probability should reflect some level of uncertainty.

Thus, a reasonable estimate might be:

  "computer science": 0.45
