To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his described characteristics align with the field of computer science. Typically, students in computer science are known for high intelligence, an aptitude for solving puzzles and abstract concepts, and often have an appreciation for hard work and dedication.

However, the strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature might point towards fields that deal more with living organisms or environmental studies. Therefore, while Adam's traits of intelligence, puzzle-solving, and appreciation for hard work align with computer science, his empathy, and love for animals might slightly lower the probability compared to typical computer science students.

Given this analysis, let's provide an estimated value:

{
  "computer science": 0.6
