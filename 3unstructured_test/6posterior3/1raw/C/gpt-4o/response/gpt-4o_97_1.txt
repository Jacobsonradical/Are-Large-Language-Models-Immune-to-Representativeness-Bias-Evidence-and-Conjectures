To calculate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would typically apply Bayes' Theorem. However, given the information available, we will consider how his personality traits align with the common traits of people in the field of computer science. Below is a qualitative assessment leading to a subjective probability.

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**: People in computer science can indeed have diverse interests, including nature, but this isn't a strong indicator for or against the field.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This is a strong positive indicator for computer science, as problem-solving skills are crucial in this field.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals**: While not directly related to computer science, these traits don't necessarily disqualify someone from the field.
4. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: Another strong positive indicator, as computer science requires both these qualities.
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This trait fits well with the demanding and often rigorous nature of computer science studies.

Given the match of traits like puzzle-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, we assign a subjective high probability, but we must adjust for the fact that empathy and a love for animals might be less commonly emphasized in computer science narratives.
