To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we must consider the match between the characteristics described and typical traits for a graduate student in computer science. 

- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: This fits more with fields like biology or environmental science rather than computer science.
- Quiet boy enjoying solving puzzles: This suggests a proclivity for logical thinking and problem-solving, which is a good match for computer science.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals: These traits are more commonly associated with fields like psychology or veterinary science, though they donâ€™t exclude computer science.
- High intelligence and proficiency in abstract concepts: This is a very good match for computer science, as high-level abstract thinking is crucial in this field.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: This is a neutral trait that could apply to any graduate field, including computer science.

Considering these factors:

1. The enjoyment of solving puzzles and proficiency in abstract concepts align well with the field of computer science.
2. The empathy and love for animals might suggest a field closely tied to biology or psychology, but does not rule out computer science entirely.
3. Curiosity about nature points slightly away from computer science and towards more biological sciences.
  
Hence, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality traits, could be appreciable but not exceptionally high, taking into account the mixture of evidence suggesting compatibility with other fields:
