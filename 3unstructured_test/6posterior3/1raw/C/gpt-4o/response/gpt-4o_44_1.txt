To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, I would typically rely on Bayesian inference. To apply Bayes' theorem, we need the following:

1. **Prior Probability (P(E))**: The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science.
2. **Likelihood (P(T|E))**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits assuming he is in computer science.
3. **Evidence (P(T))**: The overall probability of observing such a personality sketch.

However, we don't have concrete statistical data for precise calculation, so we will make some logical estimations based on the given personality sketch and general knowledge.

Given Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits are a mix of qualities that could fit several fields, including computer science, biology, environmental science, etc. Here, we make a heuristic estimation.

1. **Prior (P(E))**: Let's assume that for graduate students in the U.S., the probability of being enrolled in computer science might be around 0.15 (15%).
2. **Likelihood (P(T|E))**: Assume that a person with Adam's traits fits moderately well with computer science (since his curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving ability align well), so we might assign this a value of 0.4.
3. **Evidence (P(T))**: The probability of observing such traits in general, assuming a student randomly from various fields, could be varied. Let's assume it’s around 0.3.

Applying Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(E|T) = \frac{P(T|E) \cdot P(E)}{P(T)} \]

Substituting the estimated values:

\[ P(E|T) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{0.3} \]

\[ P(E|T) = \frac{0.06}{0.3} \]

\[ P(E|T) = 0.2 \]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is:

{
  "computer science": 0.2
