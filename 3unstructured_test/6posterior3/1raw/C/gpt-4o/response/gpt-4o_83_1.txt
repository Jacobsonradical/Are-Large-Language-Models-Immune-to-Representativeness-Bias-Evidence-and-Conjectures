To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to employ Bayesian reasoning. Given that we don't have the exact priors and likelihoods necessary for a detailed computation, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the description provided.

Let's assess the match based on Adam's characteristics:

- Adam has high intelligence and can understand abstract concepts, which are important traits for someone in computer science.
- He enjoys solving puzzles, another relevant skill for computer science.
- However, he has a strong empathy, a love for animals, and an appreciation for nature, which might suggest a leaning towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies rather than computer science.

Considering these points, we can propose a posterior probability value while acknowledging the inherent subjectivity due to the lack of precise statistical data.

Given this qualitative assessment, here's the computed probability:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This value suggests that while there are characteristics in Adam's personality sketch that align with someone studying computer science, other aspects of his profile might make fields related to nature or animals more likely.
