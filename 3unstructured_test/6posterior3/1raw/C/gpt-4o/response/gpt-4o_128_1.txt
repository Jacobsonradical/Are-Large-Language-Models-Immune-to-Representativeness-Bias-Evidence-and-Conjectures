To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his qualities align with common traits found in computer science students. 

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

### Explanation:
- **Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants**: This trait is more commonly associated with fields like biology, botany, or environmental science rather than computer science.
- **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This trait might indicate an interest in problem-solving and logic, which aligns well with computer science.
- **Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals**: These traits are less directly related to computer science but suggest Adam is likely to pick a field where he feels he can have a meaningful impact.
- **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: These qualities are critical for success in computer science.
- **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: These traits are important for any field but are particularly valuable in demanding fields like computer science.

Based on the above analysis, while some of Adam's traits are a good fit for computer science, others suggest he might be more inclined towards fields focused on nature and animals. Therefore, I have assigned a moderate probability of 0.3.
