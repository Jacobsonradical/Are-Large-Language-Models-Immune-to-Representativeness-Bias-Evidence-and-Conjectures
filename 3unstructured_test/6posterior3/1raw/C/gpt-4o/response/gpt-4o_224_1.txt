To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits match the type of student typically found in that field. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects of Adam's personality and how they might relate to a computer science student:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**: This trait does not strongly indicate a preference for computer science specifically, as it is more related to biological sciences, environmental science, or botany.

2. **Solving puzzles**: Being good at solving puzzles can correlate well with the skill set needed for computer science, which often involves problem-solving and logical thinking.

3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals**: These traits are more commonly associated with fields like psychology, social work, veterinary science, or biology, rather than computer science.

4. **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: These are strong indicators of success in computer science, which involves theoretical understanding and abstract reasoning.

5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This trait is universal and can apply to any field, including computer science.

Given these considerations, we can conclude that while some of Adam's traits align well with computer science (like solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts), others (like his empathy and love for nature) do not necessarily point towards a strong likelihood of being enrolled in computer science. 

Based on a qualitative assessment of the alignment between Adam's traits and the typical characteristics of a computer science student, we might assign a moderate probability to the possibility that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Thus, a reasonable posterior conditional probability might be:
