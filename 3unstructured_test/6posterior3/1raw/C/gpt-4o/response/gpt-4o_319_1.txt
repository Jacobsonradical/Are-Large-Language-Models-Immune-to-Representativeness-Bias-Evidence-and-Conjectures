To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem. However, to apply Bayes' Theorem effectively, we need the prior probabilities and the likelihoods, which are typically derived from more extensive data sets or domain expertise. For simplicity, we will make some reasonable assumptions based on the provided information.

Let's denote:

- \( P(CS|PS) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(PS|CS) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(PS) \): The overall probability of having a personality sketch like Adam's.

We can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|PS) = \frac{P(PS|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(PS)} \]

Making assumptions about the probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): Assuming the popularity of computer science among graduate students, we might estimate this to be around 0.20 (20%).
- \( P(PS|CS) \): Computer science students often have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, so this could be relatively high, say 0.70 (70%).
- \( P(PS) \): The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch can be more complex involving various fields, but let's approximate it to around 0.10 (10%) to account for his specific mixture of traits.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|PS) = \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.20}{0.10} = 1.4 \]

Since probabilities cannot exceed 1, we must interpret this result carefully. The high numerator suggests a strong fit, we must normalize it within a logical framework. Given our assumptions, let's cap the result at 1 (100%) as an indication of high confidence rather than directly over-inflating probabilities:

\[ P(CS|PS) \approx 0.70 \]

Thus, based on the given personality sketch and reasonable assumptions:
