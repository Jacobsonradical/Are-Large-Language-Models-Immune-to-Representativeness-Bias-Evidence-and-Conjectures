  "computer science": 0.2
}

Explanation:
Given Adam's personality traits—his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and enjoyment of solving puzzles—it's more likely that his field of study would align with natural sciences, biology, or environmental studies. However, the traits of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts also align with computer science, suggesting some probability, albeit lower, for this field. Given these considerations, I’ve estimated the probability of Adam being in computer science as 0.2.
