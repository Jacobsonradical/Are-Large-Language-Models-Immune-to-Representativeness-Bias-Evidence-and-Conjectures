To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. However, we do not have enough specific numerical data to perform precise calculations. Instead, we will make an educated guess based on the information provided.

Bayes' theorem is stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability of event A occurring given event B is true.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of event B occurring given event A is true.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability of event A.
- \(P(B)\) is the probability of event B.

For Adam:
- \(A\) can be his enrollment in computer science.
- \(B\) can be his personality sketch.

We will consider qualitative insights:

1. **Genuine Curiosity:** Computer science often attracts curious individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and uncovering how things work.
2. **Enjoys Solving Puzzles:** This trait aligns strongly with computer science, which involves algorithmic thinking and problem-solving.
3. **Warm Heart and Empathy:** While these traits aren't specific to any field, having empathy can be valuable in user-centered design and ethical considerations in technology.
4. **Deep Love for Animals:** This does not particularly favor computer science over other fields.
5. **High Intelligence and Understanding Abstract Concepts:** These are crucial for success in computer science.
6. **Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication:** Important for any advanced study, including computer science.

Given the combination of enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and an ability to understand abstract concepts, it is reasonable to infer that Adam could be involved in computer science, although his empathy and love for animals might also align with fields like biology or environmental science. Based on the qualitative match of these traits with computer science, an educated guess for the probability can be made:
