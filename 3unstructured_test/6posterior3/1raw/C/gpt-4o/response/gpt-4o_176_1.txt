To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider the traits mentioned and how they correlate with typical characteristics of a computer science student. Let's break this down qualitatively:

1. **Intelligence and Good at Abstract Concepts**: This strongly correlates with computer science, as the field requires high intellectual ability and understanding abstract concepts like algorithms, data structures, and computational theories.

2. **Enjoys Solving Puzzles**: Another strong correlation, as many computer scientists enjoy problem-solving and logic puzzles, which are integral to programming and algorithm design.

3. **Quiet and Empathetic with a Love for Animals**: These traits are more neutral with respect to computer science. The love for animals and empathy do not strongly correlate with or against the field.

4. **Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication**: This correlates positively as computer science generally requires diligent work and perseverance.

5. **Genuine Curiosity About Nature and Plants**: This does not strongly indicate an inclination towards computer science; it might suggest an interest in biology or environmental science, but it does not preclude him from being interested in computer science as well.

Given that the strong relevant correlations (intelligence, abstract thinking, puzzle-solving, and appreciation for hard work) outweigh the neutral and non-correlating traits, it is plausible to conclude that the posterior probability is on the higher side, albeit not certain.

A reasonable posterior probability, given his personality sketch, could be estimated around 0.7.
