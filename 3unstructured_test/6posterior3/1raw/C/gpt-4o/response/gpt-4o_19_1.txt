To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science (CS) given his personality sketch, we need to consider several elements that play a role in how a person's interests and traits match the characteristics of individuals typically found in the field of computer science. 

For the sake of this example, let us assume a few base rates and likelihoods (though not statistical data-based, these assumptions can provide a guiding framework):

1. **Base Rate for Enrollment in CS:**
   In the U.S., let's estimate that about 10% of graduate students are enrolled in computer science programs.

2. **Likelihood Given Traits:**
   Adam's traits can be broken down and qualitatively assessed for suitability to computer science:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: This could be less directly related but could manifest in CS fields like bioinformatics or environmental data analysis.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: This is highly relevant and supportive of computer science.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: This aligns strongly with the skills needed in computer science.
   - Empathy and love for animals: This is less directly relevant, though it might inform choices to work on animal-centric technology solutions, such as AI for wildlife conservation.
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: This aligns well with the perseverance needed in rigorous computer science studies.

Given these points, we can say that the alignment of Adam's traits to typical characteristics of individuals in computer science is pretty strong, though his empathy and animal love slightly dilute that fit.

Combining these elements, we can estimate the subjective conditional probability.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

In this hypothetical and simplistic qualitative assessment, the attributes related to problem-solving, intelligence, and abstract understanding heavily outweigh the less-directly-related qualities, giving us an estimated posterior conditional probability of 0.7 for Adam being enrolled in computer science.
