  "computer science": 0.2
}

Explanation: Although Adam's curiosity, high intelligence, and problem-solving skills might point towards a fit for computer science, his genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals might suggest other fields like biology or environmental science could be a better fit. Therefore, while there is a non-negligible chance he might be in a computer science program given his abstract thinking and intelligence, the probability isn't extremely high. A value of around 0.2 reflects this consideration.
