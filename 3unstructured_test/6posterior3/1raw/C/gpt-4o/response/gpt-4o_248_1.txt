To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science (CS) given his personality sketch, we typically use Bayes' Theorem. However, the details needed to make an accurate calculation, such as the prior probabilities of students in different fields, their characteristics in those fields, and the likelihood of Adam's traits within those fields, are not provided. Therefore, a precise numerical value can't be determined without additional statistical data.

Nevertheless, I can give a qualitative assessment based on Adam's interests and traits:

- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are traits often found in CS students.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns with the problem-solving nature of CS.
- Computer science can involve studying algorithms, which might appeal to someone who likes solving puzzles.

However, some traits such as a deep love for animals, warm heart, strong empathy, and a curiosity about nature are less directly related to computer science and might be more associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or even veterinary studies.

Given these considerations, a qualitative posterior probability can be formulated as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

This probability is a qualitative estimate and should be interpreted as a moderate likelihood. For an accurate posterior probability, empirical data on the distribution of students' traits across different fields would be needed.
