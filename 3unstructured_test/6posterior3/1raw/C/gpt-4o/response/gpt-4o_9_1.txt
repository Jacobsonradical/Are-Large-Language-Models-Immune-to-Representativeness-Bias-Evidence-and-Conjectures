To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we must consider the alignment of his described traits with the typical traits of a computer science student.

Traits mentioned in Adam's sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet boy
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence
- Good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Computer science students typically demonstrate:
- Enjoy solving puzzles (strong alignment)
- High intelligence (strong alignment)
- Good at understanding abstract concepts (strong alignment)
- Appreciate hard work and dedication (strong alignment)

Additional traits that were mentioned about Adam:
- Curiosity about nature and plants
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals

While these additional traits do not directly indicate a tendency toward computer science, they also do not preclude an interest in the field.

Given these considerations and the alignment of several key traits, here's our probability assessment:

{
  "computer science": 0.6
