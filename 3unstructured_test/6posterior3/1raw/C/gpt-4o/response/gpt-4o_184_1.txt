To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider both his personal traits and his interests in relation to the typical fields of study for graduate students. However, please bear in mind that this is not a precise calculation but more of a probabilistic estimation based on available clues.

Adam's traits:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
2. Enjoys solving puzzles
3. Warm heart and strong empathy
4. Love for animals
5. High intelligence
6. Good at understanding abstract concepts
7. Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Considering these points, we assess their alignment with typical characteristics of graduate students in computer science:

1. Enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence are strong indicators for a fit in computer science.
2. Good understanding of abstract concepts is a notable match for computer science, which often involves complex problem-solving and theoretical concepts.
3. Curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and strong empathy typically align more directly with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary sciences.

While Adam's personality traits around empathy, love for nature and animals might suggest a stronger fit for biology-related fields, his enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science. Given about seven traits provided, the alignment with computer science might not be overwhelming but still significant.

Thus, taking these points into account, I would estimate a moderate posterior conditional probability for Adam being enrolled in computer science.
