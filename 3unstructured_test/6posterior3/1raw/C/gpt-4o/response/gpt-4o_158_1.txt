To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayesian reasoning. Bayesian inference updates the probability estimate for a hypothesis as additional evidence is acquired.

The fields of interest can be modeled using relevant features from Adam's personality sketch. However, without specific base rates (prior probabilities) of enrollment in various fields for graduate students in the U.S. in 2021, the solution includes subjective estimation.

Assumptions and simplifications:
1. We don't have prior probabilities (base rates) so we'll assume equal priors for fields considering them equally likely initially.
2. We use the given personality traits to weigh their compatibility with a typical student in computer science.

Key personality elements:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted
- Strong empathy and deep love for animals
- High intelligence, good at abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Factors affecting the likelihood of Adam being in Computer Science:
- Enjoys solving puzzles and high intelligence: **Positively correlated**
- Good at understanding abstract concepts: **Positively correlated**
- Curiosity about nature and deep love for animals: **Less correlated** with typical CS focus
- Warm-hearted and strong empathy: Neutral but not typical markers for CS

Given the above considerations, while solving puzzles, high intelligence, and the appreciation for abstract concepts are positive indicators, the love for nature and animals and high empathy are less related to computer science than to other potential fields like biology or environmental science.

The probability must reflect balance, leading to an intuitive but not definitive value:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```
This implies a 30% probability given how his traits distribute in the context of computer science. This is a subjective assessment lacking precise statistical data and therefore should be interpreted as a rough heuristic.
