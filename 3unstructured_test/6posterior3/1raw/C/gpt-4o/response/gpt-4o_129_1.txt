To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we should consider how Adam's traits align with typical characteristics of a computer science student. Here's the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Traits and Interests:**
    - **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants:** This is not a direct indicator of computer science but shows a scientific and inquiry-driven mind.
    - **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles:** Puzzles often require logical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are relevant to computer science.
    - **Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals:** These traits are more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies but donâ€™t exclude computer science.
    - **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts:** This is highly relevant to computer science, which requires understanding complex algorithms and theoretical concepts.
    - **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication:** This trait is universally valuable but particularly important in rigorous fields like computer science.

2. **Background Context:**
    - **Graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:** Many graduate programs in the U.S. have a significant number of students in computer science, which is a highly popular and competitive field. This statistical context slightly increases the likelihood.

Given these considerations, we can assign a qualitative probability. While Adam's empathy and love for animals might point more towards life sciences, his problem-solving skills, intelligence, and appreciation for abstract concepts align well with computer science.

Let's estimate the posterior conditional probability:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

This reflects a reasonably high likelihood that Adam could be in computer science, given that the indirect indicators do not strongly negate this possibility and there are several supporting traits.
