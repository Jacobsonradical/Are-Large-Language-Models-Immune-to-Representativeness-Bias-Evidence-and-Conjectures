To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. However, we do not have explicit priors and likelihoods to use the theorem directly. Instead, let's qualitatively assess the likelihood based on his personality traits and provided information. 

Adam's traits include:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoying solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Based on these traits, some fields might seem more aligned with his personality than others. For instance, fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology might seem more directly relevant to his interests in nature and animals. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also suggest a capacity for computer science, especially if it is applied to problem-solving or understanding natural systems.

Given this qualitative assessment, it's reasonable to place his probability of being in computer science slightly lower, but not extremely low, as he has the intellectual capability and enjoys puzzles, which is relevant to the field.

Hence, within a range of 0 to 1, let's assume a moderate probability.
