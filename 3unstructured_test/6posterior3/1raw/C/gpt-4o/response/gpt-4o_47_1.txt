To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider both the provided personality traits and the base rate (prior probability) for students enrolling in various fields. However, since we lack specific base rates and detailed modeling information, I can only provide a conjectural estimate based on the alignment of Adam's traits with the typical characteristics valued in computer science.

Traits like high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles are strongly aligned with success in computer science. However, Adam's warm heart, empathy, love for animals, and a genuine curiosity about nature and plants might also suggest alignment with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science.

With these considerations in mind, I would assign a reasonably high conditional probability to computer science, while not asserting full certainty.

Therefore, my estimated posterior probability is:
{
  "computer science": 0.6
}
