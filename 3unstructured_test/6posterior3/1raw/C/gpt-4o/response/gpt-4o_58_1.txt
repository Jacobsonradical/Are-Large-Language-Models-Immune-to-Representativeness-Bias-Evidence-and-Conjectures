To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would ideally utilize Bayes' Theorem. However, without exact numerical information about the probability distribution of Adam's personality traits among computer science students versus the general graduate student population, I will provide a reasoned qualitative assessment to offer a value between 0 and 1. 

Adam's traits such as high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and an enjoyment of solving puzzles could align well with a field like computer science, which often requires these skills. However, his strong empathy, love of animals, and curiosity about nature and its various plants might suggest a tendency towards fields like biology, environmental science, or other natural sciences rather than computer science specifically.

Considering the balance of these traits:
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts fit computer science well.
- Love of nature and animals, strong empathy, and curiosity about plants are less typically aligned with computer science and more with life sciences.

Taking into account these contrasting alignments, I will provide a moderately low probability:

  "computer science": 0.3
