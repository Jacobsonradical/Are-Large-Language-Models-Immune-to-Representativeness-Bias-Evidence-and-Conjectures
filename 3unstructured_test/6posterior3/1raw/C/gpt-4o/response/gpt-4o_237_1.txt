To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, it's important to note that a precise calculation would typically require specific probability values for each trait and their respective correlations with various academic fields, which are not provided here. Given the qualitative nature of the personality sketch, we will make an educated estimation based on the provided characteristics and their typical relevance to computer science.

Let's break down Adam's personality traits and see how they relate to computer science:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants**: This trait leans more towards natural sciences like biology or environmental science rather than computer science.
   
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This is strongly aligned with computer science, where problem-solving skills are essential.

3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals**: While these traits suggest a compassionate nature, which is less directly related to computer science, they don't preclude interest in the field.

4. **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: This is a strong indicator for computer science, which often deals with abstract thinking and problem-solving.

5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This is a positive indicator for any challenging field, including computer science.

Given these traits, Adam has qualities that are both aligned with and diverge from the typical profile of a computer science student. The enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence are strong indicators towards computer science. However, his curiosity about nature and empathy might suggest other fields such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology.

Based on this qualitative analysis, we can estimate the likelihood that Adam might be enrolled in computer science.

So, we might estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.6
}

This value acknowledges that while Adam's traits align well with computer science, there are other strong interests in nature and animals that could lead him to other fields.
