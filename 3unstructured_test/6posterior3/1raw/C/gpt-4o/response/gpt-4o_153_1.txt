Given the personality sketch of Adam and the information about his educational background, we can use a qualitative approach to estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. However, without specific statistical data, this will be a subjective estimation rather than a precise calculation.

Adam's characteristics include:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

While some of these traits align with the field of computer science (such as enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts), others (such as a deep love for animals and a strong curiosity about nature) suggest a possible interest in fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science.

Given these mixed indications, we might weigh the traits and make an informed estimation. Let's assume the probability of a graduate student in the U.S. being in computer science without any additional information is moderate, say around 0.25 (25%).

Given that some of Adam's traits are highly compatible with computer science, but others strongly pull towards biological and environmental sciences, we might estimate a posterior conditional probability somewhere between the low and medium range to account for these competing interests.

  "computer science": 0.3

This indicates a moderate probability, but slightly adjusted to account for his strong affinity for nature and animals alongside his high intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities.
