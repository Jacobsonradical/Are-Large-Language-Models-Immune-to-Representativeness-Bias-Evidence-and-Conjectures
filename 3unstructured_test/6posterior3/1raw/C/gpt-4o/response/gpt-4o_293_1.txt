To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, we'd typically use Bayes' theorem. However, we don't have specific prior probabilities or likelihoods based on detailed statistical data. Instead, we can make a reasoned estimation based on the given characteristics and compare them to typical attributes of students in the field of computer science.

Adam's attributes such as high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with characteristics beneficial for computer science.

Given that context, here is a reasoned estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.7
}

This suggests a reasonably high probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, acknowledging the match between his traits and those often found in this field.
