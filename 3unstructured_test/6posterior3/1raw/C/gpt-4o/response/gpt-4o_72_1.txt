To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would ideally use Bayesian inference. Without empirical data or prior probabilities, we will have to rely on qualitative reasoning based on the traits described.

Given Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, appreciation for hard work, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and quiet demeanor, he could potentially fit into multiple fields. However, his interests and traits align closely with fields that involve analytical thinking, problem-solving, and possibly computational biology or environmental sciences.

Since we don't have explicit prior probabilities or a dataset to infer from, this estimation is inherently subjective but informed by typical characteristics of students in various fields.

Given that:
- Adam has high intelligence and understands abstract concepts (traits beneficial in computer science),
- Enjoys solving puzzles (common in computer science problem-solving),
- But also has a significant interest in nature and animals (less typical for computer science),

I would estimate the conditional probability Adam was enrolled in computer science as follows:
