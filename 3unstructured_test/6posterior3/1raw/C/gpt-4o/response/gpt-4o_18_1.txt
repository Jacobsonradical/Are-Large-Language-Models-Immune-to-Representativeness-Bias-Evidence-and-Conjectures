To compute a posterior conditional probability in this context ideally requires detailed information about the base rates (prior probabilities) of graduate students in each field, the likelihood of someone with Adam's personality traits being in each field, and the distribution of personality traits among students in those fields. Since this information is not provided, making precise calculations isn't possible. However, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the information given.

Adam's traits show a strong inclination towards nature, animals, solving puzzles, high intelligence, and abstract thinking. These traits might fit better into fields related to biology, environmental science, or cognitive sciences, rather than computer science. However, some of the traits such as solving puzzles, high intelligence, and abstract thinking do overlap with typical traits found in computer science students.

Given this qualitative analysis, we can estimate the posterior probability without exact numerical data:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

This value accounts for the overlap of certain traits with computer science, but also acknowledges that his strong curiosity about nature and love for animals may lean him towards other disciplines.
