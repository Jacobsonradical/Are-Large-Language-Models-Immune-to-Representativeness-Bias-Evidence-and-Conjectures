To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, we can leverage Bayes' theorem. Bayesian analysis involves combining prior knowledge with the provided evidence to make an estimate. While I don't have specific numerical datasets, we can conceptually analyze the fit of Adam's personality with the field of computer science based on commonalities.

Traditional proportionate representation in graduate fields:
- Computer science attracts many students with strong intellectual abilities and curiosity in problem-solving.
- Attributes like high intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding abstract concepts are strongly correlated with computer science.
- However, it is also essential to factor in Adam’s deep love for nature and animals, which might steer preferences towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science.

Combining these factors:
- Given Adam's problem-solving skills and intelligence, he fits well within many aspects of computer science.
- His strong empathy, appreciation for hard work, and love for nature might slightly decrease the probability compared to someone with purely computational or technical interests.

Given these qualitative assessments, let’s estimate a value. Note that this is a rough estimate due to the absence of exact prior probabilities and domain-specific statistical data.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

The value of 0.6 reflects that there is a moderately high likelihood that Adam could be studying computer science, given the parts of his personality that align with typical traits of students in that field, while also allowing for other interests that may slightly lower this probability.
