Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest certain fields may be more likely than others. Computer Science can involve abstract concepts which align with his high intelligence, but it typically is not as directly concerned with nature, animals, or empathy-driven fields as much as certain sciences like biology or environmental science might be. Therefore, while there's still a possibility, it isn't the highest probability based on the given characteristics.
