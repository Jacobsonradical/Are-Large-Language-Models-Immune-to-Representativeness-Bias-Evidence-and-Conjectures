Computing precise posterior probabilities would typically require detailed prior probabilities and explicit likelihoods for each field of study, which are not provided in this scenario. However, based on the given personality sketch of Adam, some qualitative insights can be offered.

Let's assess Adam's fit for computer science based on his characteristics:

- **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**: This characteristic could apply to a variety of fields, including computer science if considering areas like computational biology or bioinformatics.
  
- **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This is a strong indication that he might find computer science appealing, especially with areas like algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving in programming.

- **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals**: These traits might suggest a tendency towards fields with direct human-animal interaction, such as biology, veterinary medicine, or environmental sciences, though computer science isn't excluded if he applies it towards humane technology or animal welfare applications.

- **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: These are key traits beneficial in computer science, which often requires abstract thinking and advanced problem-solving.

- **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This can be applied to any rigorous academic field, including computer science.

Taking these factors into account, we can qualitatively estimate the posterior conditional probability.

This estimate reflects his problem-solving skills, intelligence, and appreciation for abstract concepts, all of which align well with attributes needed for computer science. However, other personal interests could influence his choice away from this field.
