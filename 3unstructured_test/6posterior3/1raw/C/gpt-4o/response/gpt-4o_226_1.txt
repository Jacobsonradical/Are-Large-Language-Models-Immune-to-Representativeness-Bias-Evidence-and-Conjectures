To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would generally use Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific numerical values for the prior probabilities and likelihoods associated with different fields and the given personality traits, this exercise will rely more on qualitative assessment.

Given Adam's traits ("genuine curiosity about nature and plants," "love for animals," "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," and "good at understanding abstract concepts"), there are several academic fields he might have been enrolled in. Computer science could be one possibility given his intelligence and enjoyment of puzzle-solving, which aligns well with the problem-solving aspect that is central to computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals might suggest other fields like biology or environmental science.

Still, for the sake of this exercise, let's assign a qualitative probability based on these considerations.

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

This value reflects the likelihood that he could be in computer science due to his problem-solving skills and intelligence, balanced against the likelihood that his love for nature and animals might lead him to another field.
