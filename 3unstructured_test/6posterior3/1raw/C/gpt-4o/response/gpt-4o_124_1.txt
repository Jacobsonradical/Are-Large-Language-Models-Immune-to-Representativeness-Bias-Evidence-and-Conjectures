To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, we could apply Bayes' theorem. However, without concrete prior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in various fields and specific likelihoods, an exact numerical answer is challenging to determine. Instead, we can qualitatively assess the fit:

Adam’s strengths include:
- High intelligence
- Understanding abstract concepts
- Solving puzzles
These traits dovetail well with computer science, which demands high intellect and abstract thinking.

However, his deep love for animals and genuine curiosity about nature and plants may not strongly correlate with computer science, suggesting other fields like biology or environmental science could be more fitting.

Given these considerations, let’s estimate a moderate posterior probability.
