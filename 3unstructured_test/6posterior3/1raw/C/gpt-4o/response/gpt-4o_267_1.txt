To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits match the typical traits associated with a student in that field. This involves applying Bayesian inference, but without explicit prior probabilities and likelihoods, the calculation is quite qualitative. 

Key traits from Adam's personality sketch for comparison to a computer science student:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Neutral or mildly negative for computer science.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Strongly positive.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals: Neutral or mildly negative for computer science.
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts: Strongly positive.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Positive.

From this qualitative analysis, Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and good understanding of abstract concepts are significant positive indicators toward computer science. The empathy and love for animals are neutral to slightly negative indicators but do not outweigh the stronger positive indicators.

Given this qualitative assessment, a reasonable posterior probability might be around 0.6 or higher since there is a notable fit, but not an overwhelming one.
