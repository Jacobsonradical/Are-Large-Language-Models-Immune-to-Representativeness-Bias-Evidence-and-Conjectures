To calculate the posterior conditional probability, we need to consider both the likelihood of someone with Adam's traits enrolling in computer science and the prior probability of enrollment in computer science among graduate students in the U.S. Since we don't have specific statistical data, we can make an informed estimate based on the personality sketch.

From Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted, empathetic, loves animals
- High intelligence and good at abstract concepts
- Appreciates hard work and dedication

These traits make him a good fit for fields that involve problem-solving and abstract thinking, such as computer science. However, his love for nature and animals might suggest a leaning toward environmental science, biology, or fields related to sustainability.

Thus, considering these factors qualitatively, we estimate the likelihood of him being in computer science:
