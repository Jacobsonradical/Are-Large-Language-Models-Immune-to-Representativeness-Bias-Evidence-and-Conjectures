To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how his traits align with typical characteristics of computer science students, as well as general enrollment data. 

Given that Adam has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts, these are all qualities that align well with the skill set needed for computer science. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals might indicate a likelihood for fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps even veterinary studies.

The Bayesian probability can be roughly estimated using this qualitative alignment:

P(Computer Science | Personality) = [P(Personality | Computer Science) * P(Computer Science)] / P(Personality)

However, without exact values for these probabilities, we'll consider a logical estimate based on the information. Given Adam's attributes that align with computer science traits and cross-reference with fields directly tied to his interest in nature and animals, we might estimate as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.4
}

This value accounts for the significant overlap in Adam's skill set with what is required for computer science, though recognizing his vocational interests may also lean towards other science-related fields.
