To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. However, since we don't have specific numerical values for prior probabilities or likelihoods, we can only make a qualitative assessment.

Given Adam's personality sketch:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits do not strongly align or misalign with computer science. Here's a qualitative assessment:

1. **Curiosity about nature and plants**: This might suggest a leaning towards biology or environmental science.
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**: This aligns well with problem-solving needed in computer science.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy for animals**: This doesn't particularly lean towards or away from computer science.
4. **High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts**: This aligns well with computer science.
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This is valuable in any field, including computer science.

Based on this qualitative assessment, it seems there's a decent but not overwhelming probability that Adam could be enrolled in computer science given his profile.
