To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be mathematically expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Adam is in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of Adam having the given personality sketch.

We do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, so we can make some reasonable assumptions based on common knowledge and typical probabilities.

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(A) \))**: Let's assume a reasonable prior probability that a graduate student might be enrolled in computer science. Given the popularity and demand for computer science, we could assume a prior probability of around 0.2 (or 20%). This estimate can vary, but for simplicity, we will use this value.

2. **Likelihood (\( P(B|A) \))**: This is the probability that someone in computer science has the specific personality traits described. Some aspects of the sketch, such as high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, align well with typical traits in computer science. Empathy and love for animals might be less relevant directly but don't contradict enrollment in the field. Let's assume a likelihood of around 0.5 (or 50%).

3. **Marginal Probability (\( P(B) \))**: This is the overall probability of having the given personality sketch across all fields. Given that empathy, intelligence, and curiosity about nature are quite general traits, let's assume a marginal probability around 0.3 (or 30%).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1}{0.3} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]

So, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.33.
