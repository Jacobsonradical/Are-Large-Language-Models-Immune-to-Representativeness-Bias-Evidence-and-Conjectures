To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, one would ideally use Bayes' theorem. However, since we do not have the prior probabilities, likelihoods, or the marginal probability, we'll need to make an educated guess based on qualitative analysis and the known characteristics of individuals in computer science.

Adam's characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

While Adam's love for nature and animals might initially steer us away from computer science, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with the traits often found in computer science students. The appreciation for hard work and dedication is another positive indicator for the field of computer science, which requires rigorous study and problem-solving efforts. 

Given these characteristics, we believe Adam has a moderate likelihood of being enrolled in computer science. 

Therefore, our educated guess for the posterior conditional probability is as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.4
