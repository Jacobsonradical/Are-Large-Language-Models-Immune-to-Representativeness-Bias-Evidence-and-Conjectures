To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, let's consider the following factors:

1. **Curiosity about nature and plants**: This trait doesn't strongly indicate a preference for computer science.
2. **Solving puzzles**: This trait aligns well with computer science due to the problem-solving nature of the field.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals**: These traits are more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or any field focusing on living beings.
4. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: These traits are certainly valuable in computer science, where conceptual thinking and problem-solving are essential.
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This is not field-specific and can apply to any demanding field, including computer science.

Considering all these traits, some aspects fit well with computer science (solving puzzles and abstract thinking), while others lean more towards fields related to nature and animals. Given that graduate studies typically involve a high degree of specialization, we recognize the competitiveness but also the diversity of students' backgrounds in computer science.

We cannot determine the exact prior probability without specific data. However, with the information given, we can provide a reasonable estimate for the posterior probability.
