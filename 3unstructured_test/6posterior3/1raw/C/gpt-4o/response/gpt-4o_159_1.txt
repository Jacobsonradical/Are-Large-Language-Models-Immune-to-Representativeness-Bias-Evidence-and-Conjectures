To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider several factors from his personality and academic background that align with the characteristics typically associated with computer science students. Given his attributes, let's break down the relevant information:

1. **High Intelligence and Abstract Concepts**: Computer science often requires a high level of intelligence and the ability to understand and work with abstract concepts, which fits Adam's description.
2. **Curiosity about Nature and Plants**: While this aligns more with fields like biology or environmental science, it doesn't rule out interest in computer science, especially if combined with fields like bioinformatics.
3. **Enjoyment of Solving Puzzles**: This is a strong indicator for computer science, as the field heavily involves problem-solving and logical thinking.
4. **Quiet and Empathetic**: These traits are less directly relevant to computer science but do not exclude it either.
5. **Graduate Student in the U.S. in 2021**: Graduate programs in computer science are prevalent and diverse in the U.S., making it a feasible option.

Given this synthesis, there are some strong indicators aligned with computer science, although his interest in nature and plants may point to other fields as well. Therefore, I would position the probability moderately high but not definitive.
