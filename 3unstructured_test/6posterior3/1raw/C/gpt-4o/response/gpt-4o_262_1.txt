To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, we should consider the attributes mentioned as well as the general likelihood of someone with those attributes choosing computer science.

Adam's attributes:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals
- High intelligence
- Good understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

These characteristics align with several fields, including biology, environmental science, psychology, and computer science. However, the specific combination of solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work does make computer science a plausible field, though not definitively so considering the aspects related to nature and empathy.

Given the attributes and their alignment with the typical profile of a computer science student, but also balancing them against attributes suggesting other fields, a balanced posterior probability can be estimated.

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

This value reflects a moderate likelihood, incorporating both matching and mismatching characteristics of Adam with the field of computer science.
