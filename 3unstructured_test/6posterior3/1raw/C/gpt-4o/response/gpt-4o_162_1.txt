To determine the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider the likelihood and prior probability of each field fitting Adam's traits. Although we donâ€™t have exact numerical values, we can make a reasonable estimation based on the information provided.

Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and puzzles, alongside his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, suggests that he might be a good fit for fields such as biology, environmental science, or even some branches of computer science that involve simulations or data analysis related to nature.

Given his curiosity about nature, it seems somewhat less likely that he would have chosen a purely technical or theoretical branch of computer science, though it remains a possibility (e.g., computational biology or environmental modeling might be relevant subfields).

In the absence of specific numerical data, let's estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

This estimate assumes that while there is a possibility Adam was in computer science, it is not the most intuitive match based on his described interests and personality traits, but it remains a substantial possibility due to the overlap in analytical skills and the potential for interdisciplinary applications.
