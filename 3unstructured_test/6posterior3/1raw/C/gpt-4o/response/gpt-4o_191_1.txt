To compute the posterior probability, we need to consider how well Adam's personality traits align with the typical qualities of someone studying computer science. However, without specific base rate statistics about the distribution of personality traits across different fields, we can only make a subjective qualitative assessment.

Based on Adam's personality sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals
- High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Computer science students often share some of these traits, especially enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals might suggest a leaning towards fields related to biology, environmental science, or psychology. 

Given this qualitative assessment, let's assign a subjective probability that reflects a reasonable estimate but not an overly high confidence considering possible other fields that may align with Adam's interests and traits.

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

This value acknowledges that while Adam shares some common traits with computer science students, his deep love for animals and nature somewhat decreases the posterior probability for this specific field.
