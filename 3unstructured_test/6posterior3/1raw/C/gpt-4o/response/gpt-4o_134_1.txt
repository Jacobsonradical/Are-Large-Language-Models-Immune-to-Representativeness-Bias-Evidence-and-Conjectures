To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on the given personality sketch, we need to consider how his traits align with typical characteristics of students in that field. 

Given the information:

1. Adam has genuine curiosity about nature and plants - this could indicate a lean towards natural sciences, biology, or environmental science.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles - this trait aligns well with fields like mathematics, engineering, physics, and computer science.
3. Warm heart and empathy - typically associated more with fields that involve working with people directly or animal care, such as psychology, social work, veterinary science, or humanities.
4. Deep love for animals - suggests a potential inclination towards biology, zoology, veterinary science, or environmental science.
5. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts - this aligns well with computer science, mathematics, physics, philosophy, and other analytical fields.
6. Appreciation for hard work and dedication - this is a general quality that can apply to many rigorous academic fields.

Considering the overlap with the traits that are highly relevant to computer science (enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts), but weighing in the possible stronger inclinations towards nature-related fields due to his curiosity about plants and love for animals, we can make an educated guess on the posterior probability.

Based on a qualitative assessment of how these traits match typical fields of study and considering common enrollment patterns:

{
  "computer science": 0.35
}

This value suggests a moderate likelihood that Adam was enrolled in a computer science program, though not overwhelmingly high due to his strong interest in nature and animals which might skew his likelihood towards more biological or environmental sciences.
