To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would generally need more specific information about the base rates (prior probabilities) of students in different fields, as well as how likely students with Adam's profile would enroll in computer science relative to other fields. However, given the information provided in his personality sketch, we can make a qualitative assessment.

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication might be more strongly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or even veterinary studies. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do align well with the requirements of computer science, but his personality sketch leans more towards natural sciences and fields involving empathy and animals.

Given this qualitative analysis and without additional statistical data, the posterior probability would likely be lower for computer science compared to fields more directly aligned with his interests in nature and animals.

Therefore, a reasonable estimate based on the provided information might be:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

This estimate acknowledges his aptitude for abstract thinking and intelligence, which matches computer science, but also considers his strong inclination toward nature and animals, which might make other fields more likely.
