To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would need additional data on the distribution of personality traits among various fields, including computer science. In the absence of detailed statistical data, we can make a rough estimation based on his attributes and the common characteristics of students in the field of computer science.

1. Strong intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are common traits for computer science students.
2. Appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns with the rigorous nature of computer science programs.
3. Curiosity and problem-solving skills are highly relevant for computer science.
4. Adam's empathy and interest in nature and animals are not directly related to computer science, but they do not contradict it either.

Given this qualitative assessment and recognizing that detailed data is absent:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"  // The field aligns moderately well with Adam's traits.
}
