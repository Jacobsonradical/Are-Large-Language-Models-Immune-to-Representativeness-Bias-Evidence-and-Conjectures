To compute the posterior probability, we would typically use Bayes' Theorem. However, given we don't have specific prior probabilities or likelihoods provided, I'll base the answer on a qualitative analysis of the information provided in the personality sketch.

Adam's curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are traits that could be beneficial in many fields, including computer science. However, there's also a significant emphasis on nature, plants, and animals, which may suggest an inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, or ecology.

Taking that into account, I would estimate the posterior probability given the personality sketch and assuming a rough general prior distribution of graduate students across various fields. Given the abstract thinking and puzzle-solving traits, but also considering the focus on nature and animals:
