To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider both his personality traits and the likelihood of these traits being associated with a computer science student.

Using Bayesian reasoning, we consider the following factors:

1. **Prior Probability**: The base rate of grad students in the U.S. studying computer science.
2. **Likelihood**: The compatibility of Adam's personality traits with those typically found in computer science students.
3. **Normalization**: Overall probability that Adam could belong to fields other than computer science.

### Prior Probability
The U.S. has a substantial number of graduate students in various fields, but let's assume computer science is one of the more common fields. Thus, P(CS) could be moderately high.

### Likelihood
Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants (neutral/possibly less relevant)
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles (highly relevant, common among computer science students)
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals (neutral)
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts (highly relevant)
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication (relevant across many fields, but beneficial in CS)

The likelihood of these traits fitting a typical computer science student seems reasonably high but not exclusive to CS.

### Posterior Probability Calculation (Assumption-based)
Given Adam's traits, we might qualitatively estimate that these traits are reasonably consistent with a computer science student but also fit students in other fields (like biology, neuroscience, environmental science, etc.).

To arrive at a numerical probability, consider expert judgment and Bayesian framework, which may give a posterior probability value roughly estimated to be around 0.6 to 0.7 given the traits:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65
}
```

Thus, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.65.
