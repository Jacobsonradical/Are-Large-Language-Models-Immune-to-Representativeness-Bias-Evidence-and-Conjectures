  "computer science": 0.3
}

This probability value is speculative, based on his interests and personality traits. Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align with the skills required for computer science, but his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest he might more likely be involved in fields such as biology, ecology, or environmental science. Therefore, while there's some probability he could be in computer science, it's balanced by other interests that may lead him to different fields. Thus, a moderate probability of 0.3 is assigned.
