To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider the relevance of his traits to the field of computer science. Although we don't have a specific dataset to derive empirical probabilities, we can make a qualitative assessment based on his characteristics.

### Key Traits and Their Relevance:
1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants:** Less directly related to computer science.
2. **Solving puzzles:** Highly relevant, as computer science often involves problem-solving skills.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals:** More relevant to fields like biology, psychology, or veterinary sciences, not directly related to computer science.
4. **High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts:** Very relevant to computer science, which requires abstract thinking and intelligence.
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication:** Important in all fields, including computer science.

Given these points, Adam's curiosity about nature and his empathy may not point directly to computer science. However, his intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are highly indicative of skills valuable in computer science. We need to balance these against the traits that seem less relevant to the field.

Hence, while this isn't a rigorous statistical computation, based on qualitative assessment, here is a reasonable estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6
}
``` 

This suggests a moderate likelihood that Adam could have been enrolled in computer science, primarily based on his interest in puzzles, intelligence, and abstract thinking, despite his other interests which might suggest alternate fields.
