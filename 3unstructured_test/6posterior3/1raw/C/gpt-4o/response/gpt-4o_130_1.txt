To calculate the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would conventionally use Bayes' theorem:

P(Computer Science | Personality) = (P(Personality | Computer Science) * P(Computer Science)) / P(Personality)

However, we do not have access to specific prior probabilities for each potential field he might be enrolled in. Instead, we will take an intuitive approach given the information from the personality sketch.

Factors in favor of Adam being in computer science:
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts: This aligns well with the intellectual demands of computer science.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: This trait is common in fields requiring problem-solving skills, including computer science.

Factors against Adam being in computer science:
- Strong curiosity about nature and plants: This might point towards a field related to biology, botany, or environmental science.
- Deep love for animals and empathy: These traits might be more commonly associated with studies in areas such as veterinary science, zoology, or another life sciences field.

Given these considerations, while it is plausible that someone with his intellectual traits and problem-solving skills might be in computer science, his strong naturalistic and empathetic tendencies might suggest fields in the sciences dealing more directly with life and nature.

Assigning a likely probability (acknowledging the subjective nature due to lack of specific prior data):

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

This represents a moderately low probability, considering the specifics of Adam's empathy and natural curiosity which may likely incline him more toward natural sciences and life sciences.
