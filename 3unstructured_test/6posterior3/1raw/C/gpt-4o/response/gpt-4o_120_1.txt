To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we’d generally use Bayes' Theorem. While the exact calculation would require detailed domain-specific statistics, we can provide a reasonable estimation based on the given information.

Adam has a personality that includes traits such as high intelligence, solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, empathy, and love for animals and nature. Given these traits, let’s consider how likely someone with this sketch would be to enroll in computer science.

Traits and estimation:
1. **High Intelligence and Understanding Abstract Concepts**: This highly aligns with computer science.
2. **Solving Puzzles**: Also aligns well with computer science due to the problem-solving nature of the field.
3. **Empathy and Love for Animals/Nature**: These might align more with fields like biology or environmental science, but they do not exclude computer science, especially if Adam is interested in fields like AI for biology or environmental modeling.

Given that these traits could reasonably align with computer science but also considering there are other fields where these traits are common (such as biology, environmental science, engineering), we might place a moderate but not exclusive probability on computer science.

So, let's estimate a probability:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

This value reflects a considered likelihood, acknowledging that his interests could equally place him in a variety of graduate fields but that computer science remains a strong candidate given the problem-solving and abstract reasoning components of his personality.
