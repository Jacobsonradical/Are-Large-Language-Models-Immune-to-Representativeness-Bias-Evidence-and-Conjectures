To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Adam's personality sketch being observed.

Given only the personality sketch, it is challenging to quantify these probabilities precisely. However, we can make reasonable assumptions based on typical characteristics:

1. **P(B|A)**: The probability of Adam's characteristics given he is in computer science can be moderately high if we consider that individuals in such a field often display high intelligence and problem-solving skills. However, his strong empathy and love for nature and animals might be less directly correlated with computer science.
   
2. **P(A)**: This is the base rate of graduate students in computer science. Information on exact statistics would be needed, but let's generally assume that a notable share, say 20%, of graduate students are in computer science due to the high demand for tech professionals.

3. **P(B)**: This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits in the general graduate student population, including various fields related to nature, animals, and human empathy, which could be substantial but not precisely measurable.

Let's hypothesize some example values for the sake of computation:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.5 \) (Assuming that some computer science students can have his empathy and love for nature)
- \( P(A) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(B) \approx 0.1 \) (Assumed based on the uniqueness of combination traits altogether)

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.1} = 1.0 \]

However, a value of 1.0 would indicate certainty, which is unrealistic. This suggests our hypothetical values or understanding may need adjustment, but given Adam's combination of empathy and nature curiosity diverges somewhat from the stereotypical computer science student profile, a more conservative estimate might be prudent in a real scenario.

Given the nature of the traits, qualitatively but not perfectly fitting computer science, let's present a more balanced, revised probability:

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4 \]

Thus:
```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

This acknowledges Adam's intelligence and problem-solving aligning somewhat with computer science but his deep empathy and nature focus being slightly atypical for the field.
