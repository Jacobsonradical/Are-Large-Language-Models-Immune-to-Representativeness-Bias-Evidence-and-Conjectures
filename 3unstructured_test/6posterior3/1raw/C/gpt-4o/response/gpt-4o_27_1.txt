To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider his traits and how they might align with a typical computer science student. 

Given Adam's personality:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Some of these traits can be seen as relevant to a computer science student:
- Enjoying solving puzzles aligns well with computer science, which often involves problem-solving and logical thinking.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are crucial in computer science as well.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is also important in this field.

However, Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants are not typically strongly aligned with the field of computer science. While these traits don't exclude someone from studying computer science, they might be more indicative of someone interested in fields like biology, environmental science, or possibly cognitive science.

Therefore, based on this analysis, we still might assign a moderate posterior probability to computer science considering the mixed alignment of his traits with the field. 

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

This number represents a balanced estimate considering both the alignment with problem-solving, intelligence, and dedication (traits that match well with computer science) and the traits suggesting interests possibly outside of computer science.
