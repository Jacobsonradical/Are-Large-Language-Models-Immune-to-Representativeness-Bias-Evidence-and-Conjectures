To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we'd typically use Bayes' theorem. However, without having precise prior probabilities and likelihoods for various fields of study, we must provide a subjective assessment based on the information given in the personality sketch.

Let's assess the relevant traits of Adam that could align with computer science:

1. **High Intelligence and Good at Abstract Concepts:** These are strong indicators for a field that requires logical thinking and problem-solving, such as computer science.
2. **Enjoys Solving Puzzles:** Computer science often involves troubleshooting and algorithmic thinking, which aligns well with puzzle-solving skills.
3. **Curiosity About Nature and Its Various Plants:** This might suggest a field like biology or environmental science; however, this curiosity does not preclude computer science, especially in areas like bioinformatics or environmental modeling.
4. **Empathy and Love for Animals:** These traits might suggest a career in fields like biology, veterinary studies, or even environmental science over computer science.
5. **High Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication:** This is a general trait that applies to many fields, including computer science.

Considering the above points, while Adam's empathy and love for animals might lean away from computer science, his intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving skills could align well with this field. Overall, without additional data to quantify likelihoods accurately, a subjective but reasoned posterior probability would be based on aligning his key traits with common aspects of computer science.

{
  "computer science": "0.5"
}

This value of 0.5 suggests a balanced probability, taking into account his strong intellectual traits that fit well with computer science, while also considering his empathy and love for nature, which might lean him towards a different field.
