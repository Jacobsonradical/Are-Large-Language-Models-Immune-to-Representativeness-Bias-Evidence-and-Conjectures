To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, we would generally apply Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities or detailed statistical data on the correlation between personality traits and field of study choices, we can only make a reasoned qualitative estimate.

Given the information:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, which might suggest fields like biology, botany, or environmental science.
- His intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts are traits often associated with computer science and other analytical fields like mathematics or engineering.
- His empathy and love for animals could suggest a fit with biology, zoology, or veterinary science.
- The appreciation for hard work and dedication is a more general trait that could fit many disciplines.

Given Adam's strong intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts, there is a reasonable chance he might have chosen computer science. However, considering his pronounced interest in nature, plants, and animals, he may be more inclined towards fields involving life sciences.

So, while there is a likelihood that Adam could have chosen computer science, it's balanced against his strong leanings toward nature and life sciences. My estimated probability, factoring in the possible inclination towards natural sciences but also the compatibility with computer science, might be moderate but not dominant.
