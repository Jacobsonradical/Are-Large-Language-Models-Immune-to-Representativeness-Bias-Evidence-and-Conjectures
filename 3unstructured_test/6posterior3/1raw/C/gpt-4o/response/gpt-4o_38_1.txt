To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to weigh the likelihood of his traits aligning with a computer science profile. Here we will consider:

1. High intelligence and abstract thinking: These are strong indicators for a field like computer science.
2. Enjoyment of solving puzzles: This is also a trait common among computer science students.
3. Curiosity about nature and plants: While not specific to computer science, this suggests a broader range of scientific interest, which can still align with the field.
4. Warm heart, empathy, and love for animals: These traits are more aligned with fields like biology or environmental science, but they do not preclude an interest in computer science.
5. Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: This can apply to many fields but is necessary for success in computer science as well.

Considering these points, we can hypothesize that Adam has a reasonable probability of being a computer science student, but itâ€™s not exceedingly high because some of his traits also align well with fields like biology or environmental science.

Let's assign a probability value based on this reasoning. Assuming there is an equal initial likelihood for various fields of study (biology, environmental science, computer science, etc.), and slightly leaning towards computer science based on key traits:
