To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Here, the posterior probability P(Field | Personality) is computed as:

\[ P(\text{Field} | \text{Personality}) = \frac{P(\text{Personality} | \text{Field}) \cdot P(\text{Field})}{P(\text{Personality})} \]

However, given the sketch and the format requested, we will proceed qualitatively, making reasoned estimations based on the given data.

1. **Personality Fit (P(Personality | Field))**:
   - Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science.
   - His genuine curiosity and enjoyment of solving puzzles also suggest a good fit with computer science activities.
   - The empathy and appreciation for hard work are neutral but not detrimental.

2. **Prior Probability (P(Field))**:
   - STEM fields, including computer science, tend to have a higher number of graduate students compared to some other fields.

3. **Normalization Constant (P(Personality))**:
   - This is a bit complex without specific data but can be considered as summing over all possible fields, each weighted by its respective likelihood and prior.

Given the personality traits and general fit to the activities within computer science, we estimate the posterior probability:

{
  "computer science": 0.6
} 

This estimation reflects a moderately high probability based on the provided information.
