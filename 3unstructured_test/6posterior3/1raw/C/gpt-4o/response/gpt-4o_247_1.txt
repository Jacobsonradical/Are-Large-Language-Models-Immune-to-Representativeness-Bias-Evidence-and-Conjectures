To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we will use Bayesian reasoning. 

However, please note that this is a hypothetical scenario, and exact probabilities would ideally require numerical data on the distribution of personality traits across different fields, which we do not have. Instead, we will provide a qualitative analysis based on the given description.

Given Adam's attributes:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits could certainly align with a field like computer science (due to problem-solving skills and high intelligence). However, his deep love for nature and animals might make fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science more probable.

Given the limited details and aiming to convert this qualitative assessment into a quantitative probability:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

This value reflects that while Adam's skills could suit computer science, his interests in nature, plants, and animals potentially make him more likely to be in another field. However, without precise data, this remains an educated guess.
