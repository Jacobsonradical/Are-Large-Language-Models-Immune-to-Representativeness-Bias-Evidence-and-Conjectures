In order to compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how his interests, traits, and background align with the field of computer science.

1. **Genuine Curiosity About Nature and Plants**:
   - Less directly related to computer science but does suggest a strong general curiosity.

2. **Enjoyment in Solving Puzzles**:
   - Highly relevant to computer science, especially in problem-solving and algorithm design.

3. **Warm Heart, Strong Empathy, Deep Love for Animals**:
   - Not directly relevant to computer science but can align with fields like bioinformatics or animal behavior modeling.

4. **High Intelligence and Understanding of Abstract Concepts**:
   - Very relevant to computer science, which often requires abstract thinking and logical problem solving.

5. **Understanding and Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication**:
   - Positive attribute relevant for any field, including computer science.

Given that Adam is a graduate student, we need to consider that most graduate students in computer science exhibit traits like puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and the ability to understand abstract concepts. While his empathy and love for animals donâ€™t directly point to computer science, they don't negate the possibility either.

Based on these weighted considerations and assuming we have no prior specific data on the overall graduate student distribution across fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": 0.65
}

This value takes into account the strong alignment in problem-solving and abstract thinking, while adjusting for areas less directly related to computer science.
