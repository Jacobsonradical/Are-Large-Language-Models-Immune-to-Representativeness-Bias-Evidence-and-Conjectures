To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, we can use Bayes' Theorem. However, it’s important to note that without actual statistical data on the probability distribution of personality types across different fields of study, we can only make an educated guess based on the given information.

Bayes’ Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Adam having the given personality sketch, assuming he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of a graduate student having Adam's personality sketch.

We can make a few assumptions:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science, might be relatively high given the popularity of the field, let's assume 0.20.
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability that a computer science student has Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, empathy, and love for animals) might be moderate, let’s assume 0.3.
- \( P(B) \), the overall probability of a graduate student having Adam's personality traits, might be less straightforward to estimate. We might assume it is moderate to low due to the specific combination of traits, let’s say 0.15.

So applying these to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.20}{0.15} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.06}{0.15} \approx 0.4 \]

Hence, the prediction would be:
