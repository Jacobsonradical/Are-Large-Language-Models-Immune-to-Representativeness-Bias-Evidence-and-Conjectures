To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his personality traits align with typical characteristics of students in that field. 

1. **Curiosity about nature and its various plants**: This trait is more commonly associated with fields like biology, botany, or environmental sciences rather than computer science.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This is strongly aligned with the skills and interests of computer science students.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals**: These traits are not specifically indicative of any particular field but are more commonly associated with fields involving direct care or interaction, such as veterinary science, psychology, or social work.
4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: These traits are beneficial in computer science as it involves abstract thinking and problem-solving.
5. **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This is a general positive trait that can apply to any field of study.

Given the above points, especially considering his enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence which align well with computer science, but also noting his curiosity about nature which is less aligned, we can estimate the posterior probability.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can arrive at the following posterior probability value:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Note that this is a subjective assessment and actual data on graduate fields of study and personality trait alignments would provide a more accurate probability.
