To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics align with the stereotypical attributes of a computer science student. These attributes include high intelligence, abstract thinking, problem-solving skills, and possibly an appreciation for dedication and hard work.

Let's analyze Adam's personality traits:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants - This trait does not directly relate to computer science but suggests a broad interest in intellectual pursuits.
2. A quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles - This strongly aligns with the typical trait of computer science students, as they often enjoy problem-solving.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals - These traits are not typical for computer science but do not necessarily disqualify him from the field.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts - These traits are very relevant and beneficial for computer science studies.
5. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication - This aligns well with the demanding nature of computer science.

Taking into account all these factors, we can make an educated estimate. While we don't have exact statistical data on the proportion of computer science students with these traits, we can infer a likelihood:

Given the strong alignment with problem-solving skills, intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work, combined with the less directly related but not disqualifying other traits, I will estimate the probability:
