To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Adam's personality traits given he is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits.

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can only make a qualitative guess. Given Adam's traits:

1. **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: Strongly associated with computer science, requiring logical thinking and abstract reasoning.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Suggests problem-solving skills, which are central to computer science.
3. **Curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, strong empathy**: These traits might align more with fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology, but they do not preclude an interest in computer science.

Given these points and typical stereotypes about computer science students, we can make an educated guess about the probability.

\[ P(computer science) \]

Considering the provided information and the factors mentioned:

{
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Therefore, there is a relatively high, but not overwhelming, posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on his personality sketch.
