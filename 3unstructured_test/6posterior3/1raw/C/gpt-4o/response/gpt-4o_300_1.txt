To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on his personality sketch, we need to take several points into account that correlate his characteristics with the likelihood of him being in that field. 

Here are some points to consider:

1. High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts: These attributes align well with computer science, which often requires strong analytical and abstract thinking skills.

2. Enjoyment of solving puzzles: This also aligns with the problem-solving nature of computer science.

3. Genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy: These traits might be more strongly associated with fields related to biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than traditional computer science.

4. Quiet demeanor and warm heart: These traits could apply broadly and don't strongly exclude or favor computer science.

Given the information, while Adam's love for animals and empathy could suggest an interest in fields more directly related to natural sciences or social sciences, the indications of high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding abstract concepts do fit well with computer science.

Based on these considerations, here is an educated estimate of the posterior conditional probability:

{
  "computer science": 0.6
}

This value indicates a moderate likelihood that Adam could have been enrolled in computer science, taking into account both the matching traits and those that might suggest other fields.
