To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics align with traits typically found in computer science students.

Adam:
- Has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Is quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
- Has a warm heart, strong empathy, and loves animals.
- Possesses high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Traits of a typical computer science student:
- Enjoys solving complex problems and logical puzzles.
- Appreciates abstract concepts and theoretical frameworks.
- Requires high intelligence and dedication.
- Quiet and introverted characteristics are often prevalent (though not universally).

Now, let's match these characteristics:

1. Enjoys solving puzzles: Matches.
2. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: Matches.
3. Dedication and hard work: Matches.
4. Quiet: Matches.

The alignment is fairly strong, although his curiosity about nature and empathy towards animals might also suggest suitability for fields like biological sciences or environmental science. However, these traits do not exclude computer science, and the strong emphasis on problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence aligns well with computer science.

Given these considerations, we can estimate the posterior conditional probability as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.7
}
