To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we use Bayes' theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we need to make reasoned assumptions based on the information provided. Let's break it down:

1. **High intelligence & understanding abstract concepts**: These traits are highly relevant for computer science students.
2. **Curiosity about nature and plants**: This may be less directly relevant to computer science and more relevant to fields like biology or environmental science.
3. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This trait aligns well with computer science.
4. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals**: These traits are more associated with fields involving direct interaction with living beings, like veterinary science or biology.
5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This is a more general trait but certainly valuable in computer science.

Given this information, let's make an educated guess about the likelihood of Adam being in computer science. While his curiosity about nature and love for animals point away from computer science, traits like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving align well with it. Considering these points, I would estimate the probability as moderate.

  "computer science": "0.6"

This value suggests that while there's significant evidence to support that Adam was enrolled in computer science, his interests outside of the typical scope of computer science temper that likelihood.
