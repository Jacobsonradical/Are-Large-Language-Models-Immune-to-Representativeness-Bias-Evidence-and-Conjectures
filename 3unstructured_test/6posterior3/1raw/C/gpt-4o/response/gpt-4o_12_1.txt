To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. However, we would typically require prior probabilities and the likelihood of this specific personality sketch given enrollment in computer science and other potential fields for a more accurate calculation. Since we don’t have access to specific data, we can make a reasoned estimate based on common characteristics associated with computer science students.

Adam has several traits that might align well with studying computer science:
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts. This is highly relevant to computer science, which often requires solving complex problems and abstract thinking.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles. Many computer science tasks, like coding and algorithms, can be seen as puzzle-solving.

The other traits, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, and deep love for animals, don’t directly match with computer science but also do not exclude it.

Given these considerations, let's make a reasoned estimation.

Please note that this is a hypothetical estimate based on a qualitative analysis of the traits provided. Exact probabilities would require specific data on the distribution of personality traits among computer science students and other fields.
