To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch would typically involve applying Bayes' Theorem. However, without concrete data on the prior probabilities or the likelihoods of someone with Adam's personality traits being in various fields, the calculation cannot be precise.

Instead, we can provide a qualitative estimate based on the traits provided. Adam demonstrates curiosity, problem-solving skills, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard workâ€”all of which are traits that could align well with a field like computer science.

Given this qualitative analysis, we'll provide an estimated posterior conditional probability.
