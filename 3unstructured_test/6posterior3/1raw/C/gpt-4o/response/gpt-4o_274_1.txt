To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would ideally use Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Adam having this personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of having this personality sketch in the general population of graduate students.

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we will make reasonable qualitative assessments based on the given information.

**1. \( P(B|A) \): Probability of having this personality sketch given computer science enrollment.**
   - Computer science students are often analytical and good at solving puzzles, and they often have high intelligence and appreciation for hard work.
   - Curiosity about nature and empathy may be less strongly associated but are not contradictory.

**2. \( P(A) \): Prior probability of being enrolled in computer science.**
   - Computer science is a popular field among graduate students but not the only one. Let's assume it's reasonably common among graduate students.

**3. \( P(B) \): Probability of having this personality sketch in the general graduate student population.**
   - Curiosity about nature, empathy, high intelligence, and puzzle-solving are traits that may be distributed across a few fields like biology, psychology, and computer science. This makes the sketch somewhat but not overly common.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we might deduce a moderate probability for \( P(A|B) \).

Given the qualitative nature of this analysis, I will estimate:

  "computer science": "0.6"
