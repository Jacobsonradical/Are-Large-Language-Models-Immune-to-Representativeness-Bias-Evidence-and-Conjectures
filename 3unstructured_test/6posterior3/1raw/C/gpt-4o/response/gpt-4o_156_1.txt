To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' theorem. In this scenario, it is challenging to provide a precise numerical value due to the lack of quantitative data, so we'll make a qualitative assessment.

First, we need to assess how likely Adam's personality traits align with someone studying computer science.

- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are traits often associated with computer science students.
- Enjoying solving puzzles aligns well with computer science, which often involves problem-solving and logical thinking.
- A genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals are less directly related to computer science but do not preclude it.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work are valuable in any field, including computer science.

Given these assessments, we can qualitatively determine the likelihood, though exact numerical calculation in probability would require more detailed data. However, based on the positive alignment of criteria like intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving with the field of computer science, we can estimate a reasonable posterior probability.

Considering all these points, here is an estimation in the required format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65
}
```

This value reflects a higher-than-average probability due to the alignment of several key traits with those often found in computer science students.
