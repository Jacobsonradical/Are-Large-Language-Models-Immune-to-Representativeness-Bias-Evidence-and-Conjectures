To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his personality traits align with the typical characteristics of someone studying computer science.

Let's break it down:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants:** This trait doesn't particularly align with computer science, which is more about algorithms, data structures, and programming.
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles:** This is a strong match, as many computer science students and professionals enjoy problem-solving and often work independently or in quiet environments.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals:** These traits are not directly relevant to computer science and are more commonly associated with fields involving human or animal care.
4. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts:** This trait aligns well with computer science, which requires strong analytical and abstract thinking skills.
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication:** This is relevant to many fields, including computer science, which often demands perseverance and effort.

Based on these considerations, we can infer:

- Some traits are strongly indicative of a fit in computer science (high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles).
- Some traits are neutral or less indicative (curiosity about plants, empathy, love for animals).

Given the alignment and considering Adam was a graduate student in 2021 in the U.S., I might estimate a moderate to high posterior conditional probability that he was enrolled in computer science.

This value reflects a balanced consideration of the strengths and weaknesses of the alignment between Adam's personality sketch and typical traits of a computer science student.
