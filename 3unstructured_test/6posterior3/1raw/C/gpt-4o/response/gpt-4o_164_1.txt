To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would ideally use Bayes' Theorem, which factors in prior probabilities, likelihoods, and evidence. However, since specific numerical figures for these parameters aren't provided, I'm going to make a reasoned qualitative assessment based on Adam's personality traits and interests.

Given that Adam has high intelligence, enjoyment in solving puzzles, and appreciation for abstract concepts, he exhibits traits that align well with the skills and interests often required for a field like computer science. Additionally, his strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication would also contribute positively to pursuits in this field.

On the other hand, Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy might suggest a natural inclination toward fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. 

Given this balanced mix of attributes that align well with both computer science and other nature-oriented fields, we would assign a moderate to high posterior probability for computer science.

  "computer science": "0.6"
}

This value represents a considered estimate that, while Adam has personality traits suitable for computer science, his strong inclination towards nature and animals might also incline him towards different fields.
