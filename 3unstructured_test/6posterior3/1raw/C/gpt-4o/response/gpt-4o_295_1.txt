To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayesian reasoning. However, this calculation would typically require some empirical data about the likelihoods and prior probabilities of various fields of study given certain personality traits. 

Given the information available in Adam's personality sketch, we can perform a qualitative rather than a strictly quantitative assessment. Here’s the step-by-step process to reason through this qualitatively:

1. **Personality Traits Matching to Field Requirements**:
   - Adam’s high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are traits commonly associated with success in computer science.
   - His enjoyment of solving puzzles also aligns well with the problem-solving and logical thinking aspects of computer science.

2. **Interest in Nature and Animals**:
   - Although interest in nature and animals is not directly related to computer science, it does not preclude someone from pursuing computer science. 
   - Fields like environmental studies or biology might seem more closely related to his interest in nature and animals, but interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics also exist.

3. **Empathy and Warm Heart**:
   - While empathy and a warm heart are valuable in any field, direct applicability to computer science is less obvious unless he is working on projects like animal conservation technology or nature data analytics.

Based on qualitative logic:

- Adam’s intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving skills strongly align with computer science.
- Love for animals and nature might not be directly relevant but can coexist with computer science, especially in interdisciplinary applications.
 
Given these considerations, while it's challenging to assign a precise numeric probability without empirical data, qualitatively, it seems reasonably likely that Adam could be enrolled in computer science. 

Thus, the posterior probability is reasonably high though not guaranteed.
