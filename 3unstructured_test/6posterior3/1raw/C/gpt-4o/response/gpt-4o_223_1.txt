  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Explanation:
Given Adam's personality sketch, we assess his suitability for computer science. His intelligence, strong understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the requirements for a computer science student. However, his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals might suggest he could also be inclined towards fields like biology or environmental science. Therefore, while he has attributes that are favorable for computer science, his interest in nature suggests that there are other fields that might also be highly relevant to his character, leading to a moderate conditional probability of 0.3 for computer science.
