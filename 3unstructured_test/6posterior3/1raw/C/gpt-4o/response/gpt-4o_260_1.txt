Explanation:

Using the information provided in Adam's personality sketch, some traits align with common characteristics found in computer science students such as high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles. However, other aspects like strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants might make other fields, such as biology or environmental science, more likely. Combining these aspects, a reasonable posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is approximately 0.35.
