To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayesian reasoning or use our judgment based on the provided information about Adam's traits and interests. 

Adam has traits and interests such as curiosity about nature, a knack for solving puzzles, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals. While these can align with a field like biology, environmental science, or even psychology, they don't strongly point directly towards computer science. However, his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be relevant for computer science.

Letâ€™s make an educated estimation:

1. **Base Rate:** Consider the proportion of graduate students in the U.S. who are enrolled in computer science. For simplicity, let's assume a rough estimate that 20% of graduate students are in computer science.

2. **Likelihood:** Assess how likely it is for someone with Adam's personality to be in computer science based on typical traits. Given his interest in puzzles and high intelligence, there's some affinity, but his empathy and love for animals might sway him toward biology or environmental sciences.

3. **Posterior Probability:** Given the attractiveness of his personality towards other fields, we'll conservatively estimate the likelihood.

Let's round the numbers and conservatively estimate:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science | Adam's personality}) \approx 0.3
\]

Therefore, our estimation would be:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
