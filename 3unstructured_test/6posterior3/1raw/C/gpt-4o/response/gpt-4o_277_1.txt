To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in a computer science program given his personality sketch, we will need to make some estimations based on the provided information.

In Bayesian probability, the posterior probability can be calculated using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the posterior probability of A given B (i.e., the probability Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch).
- \( P(B | A) \) is the likelihood of observing personality traits B given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability that any graduate student has personality traits B.

Since we do not have precise values for these probabilities, let's adopt some reasonable assumptions:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   Let's assume that out of all graduate students, around 10% are enrolled in computer science.
   Hence, \( P(A) = 0.10 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(B | A) \)**:
   Students in computer science often possess analytical skills, high intelligence, and an interest in solving puzzles. Therefore, a reasonable assumption for \( P(B | A) \) could be 0.7 (70%).

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(B) \)**:
   Adamâ€™s traits, such as high intelligence, empathy, and love for nature and animals, can be observed in many fields. Let's estimate that such traits are found in 40% (0.4) of the general graduate student population.

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.70 \times 0.10}{0.40} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.07}{0.40} \]
\[ P(A | B) = 0.175 \]

So, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is 0.175 (or 17.5%).

Therefore, the answer can be provided in the required format as:
