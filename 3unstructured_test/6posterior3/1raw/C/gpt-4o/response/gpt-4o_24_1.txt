This estimate is based on the observation that Adam's high intelligence and strong understanding of abstract concepts are characteristics that align well with computer science. However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants suggest that he might be equally or more inclined towards fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. Hence, while computer science is a plausible field for Adam, it is not the most obvious choice given the broader context of his personality traits.
