To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to make some educated assumptions based on his traits and the likelihood of those traits being associated with someone in that field.

Adam's personality sketch suggests:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm heart and empathy.
- Deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Now, let's break down how these traits might align with a computer science field:
- Enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.
- High intelligence is beneficial in any field, including computer science.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is applicable to graduate studies in general.
- His genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy do not directly align with computer science but do not exclude it either.

Based on the alignment of his skills with the demands and nature of computer science, we can make an educated guess. Note we don't have population statistics specific to the field and traits, but we can qualitatively assess the probability.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

This value of 0.7 reflects a reasonably high likelihood that Adam could be enrolled in computer science given his enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are core aspects of computer science. His other traits, while not directly aligned, do not significantly conflict with this field either.
