To compute the posterior conditional probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of A given B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of B.

In this case:
- \( A \) is Adam being enrolled in computer science.
- \( B \) is Adam's personality sketch.

We need to estimate the probabilities:

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \)**: This is the prior likelihood that a graduate student in 2021 would be enrolled in computer science. Let's denote this by \( P_{\text{CS}} \). According to data from various surveys and academic institutions, a reasonable estimate for this could be around 10% or \( 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**: The probability of having Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science. Given Adam's personality traits (such as high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, ability to solve puzzles, and an understanding of abstract concepts), these are reasonably aligned with computer science characteristics, so let's say this probability is moderately high, around \( 0.6 \).

3. **Total probability \( P(B) \)**: This would be the probability of Adam's personality sketch among the general population of graduate students. This can be more complex to estimate. Let's say such a profile that fits Adam is somewhat common, but not overly so; we might estimate this as \( 0.15 \).

Now, we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{0.15} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.06}{0.15} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.4 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is:
