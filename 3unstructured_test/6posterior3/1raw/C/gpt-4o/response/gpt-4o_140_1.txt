To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would ideally use Bayes' Theorem. However, precise numerical probabilities require detailed data on the enrollment rates in various fields and how closely different personality traits align with those fields. For the sake of this exercise, I’ll make reasoned qualitative assessments based on Adam's characteristics and the typical traits and interests of students in various fields.

Based on Adam’s personality sketch, let's analyze the given traits in the context of computer science:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants**: While this trait might suggest an inclination towards fields like biology or environmental science, it doesn’t directly exclude an interest in computer science.

2. **A quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles**: This strongly aligns with computer science since programming and algorithms often involve problem-solving and puzzle-like thinking.

3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals**: These traits are quite broad and could fit many fields. It might suggest a leaning towards fields involving direct interactions with living entities, but empathy can also be a valuable trait in user-centric software design.

4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: These are crucial for success in computer science, which often involves complex and abstract problem-solving.

5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This is a general trait that is valuable in any field, including computer science.

Considering the combination of traits and making a reasoned assessment, we can qualitatively estimate the posterior conditional probability:

{
  "computer science": 0.6
}

This value suggests a reasonable likelihood that Adam, given his characteristics and interests, could have chosen to enroll in computer science.
