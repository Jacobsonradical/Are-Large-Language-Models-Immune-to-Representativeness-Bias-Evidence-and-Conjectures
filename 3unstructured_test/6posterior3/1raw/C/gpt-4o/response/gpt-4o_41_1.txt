To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would ideally use Bayes' Theorem. However, without actual prior probability data and likelihoods, we can provide a reasoned estimate.

Given Adam's high intelligence, strong understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, it is reasonable to infer that there is a relatively higher likelihood that he could be enrolled in computer science. Here is an estimated answer:
