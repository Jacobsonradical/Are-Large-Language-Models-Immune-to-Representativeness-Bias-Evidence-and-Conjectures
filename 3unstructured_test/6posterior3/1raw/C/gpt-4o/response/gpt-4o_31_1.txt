To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his characteristics match typical traits and interests of students enrolled in computer science programs. 

Given the personality sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence
- Good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's break down how these traits relate to a typical computer science student:
1. Enjoys solving puzzles: This aligns well with computer science, as it involves problem-solving.
2. High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: These are important in computer science.
3. Appreciation for hard work and dedication: necessary to succeed in computer science.

However, traits like a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals are less directly aligned with the typical interests of computer science students. 

Balancing these considerations, we can estimate the posterior conditional probability.
