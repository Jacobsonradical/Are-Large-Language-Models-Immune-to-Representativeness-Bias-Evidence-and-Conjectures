To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:

- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of having Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of having Adam's personality sketch.

To solve this, we need to make some educated estimations or use data if available. Let’s assume the following:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**: The proportion of graduate students enrolled in computer science. Let's assume this is \( 0.2 \) (20%), which may vary depending on the university's programs.

2. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**: The probability of having Adam’s personality traits given he is in computer science. We must evaluate how common Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, puzzle-solving, empathy, and love for animals) are among computer science students. Given that computer science students often enjoy puzzles and abstract thinking, let’s assume this is \( 0.4 \) (40%).

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(B) \)**: The overall probability of someone having Adam's personality traits as a graduate student. Without specific data, this is difficult to estimate precisely. Let's assume this is \( 0.2 \) (20%).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{computer science} | \text{personality sketch}) = \frac{P(\text{personality sketch} | \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(\text{personality sketch})} \]

\[ P(\text{computer science} | \text{personality sketch}) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} = 0.4 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is:
