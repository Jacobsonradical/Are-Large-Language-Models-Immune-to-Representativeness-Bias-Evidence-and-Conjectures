To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to employ Bayesian reasoning. However, the detailed statistical distribution of students in various fields matching Adam's personality traits isn't provided, so we must make a reasoned estimate based on the information given.

Adam's interest in nature, puzzles, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are traits that could align with studies in computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals might also align him with fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology.

Considering these factors:

1. The interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests a good fit for computer science.
2. Nature and animals might not directly suggest computer science unless he could be working in a related interdisciplinary field like bioinformatics or environmental modeling.
3. Empathy and a warm heart might lean towards fields involving social impact, though it doesn't exclude STEM fields.

Given these considerations, we estimate the probability, taking into account that computer science is a common choice for high intelligence and problem-solving skills, but noting his additional interests which might diversify his academic focus:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

This estimate implies a moderate likelihood that Adam was enrolled in computer science, balancing between his evident fit for the field and his other interests and traits.
