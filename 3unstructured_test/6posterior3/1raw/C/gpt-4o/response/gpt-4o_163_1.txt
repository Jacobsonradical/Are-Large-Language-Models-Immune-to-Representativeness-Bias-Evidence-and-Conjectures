To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits align with those typically associated with this field. Here are some key points from his personality sketch as they relate to computer science:

1. **Curiosity about nature and various plants**: While this trait might be more associated with fields like botany or environmental science, curiosity in general is a valuable trait in computer science for problem-solving and exploration.

2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This is a strong indicator, as computer science often involves solving complex problems and thinking algorithmically.

3. **Warm heart and strong empathy**: These social and emotional traits are not typically the primary focus in computer science, though they can be beneficial in collaborative projects and understanding user needs.

4. **Deep love for animals**: This trait is more directly relevant to fields like zoology or veterinary science, but it doesn't preclude interest in computer science.

5. **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: Strong fit, as computer science requires the ability to grasp abstract reasoning and complex theories.

6. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This is crucial for any challenging field, including computer science.

Given these points, while some of Adam's interests (e.g., love for animals, curiosity about nature) might not directly suggest computer science, his enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and appreciation for dedication align well with the field.

Therefore, an estimated posterior conditional probability might be:

  "computer science": 0.6
