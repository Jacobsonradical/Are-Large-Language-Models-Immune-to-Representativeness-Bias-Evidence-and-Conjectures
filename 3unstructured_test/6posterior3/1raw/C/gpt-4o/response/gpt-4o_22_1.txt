To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we'll consider the traits described and how they align with typical characteristics associated with computer science students.

1. **Curiosity about nature and plants**: This trait alone doesn't correlate strongly with computer science and might be more aligned with fields like biology, botany, or environmental science.

2. **Solving puzzles**: This is a trait that strongly aligns with computer science, as coding and debugging can often be seen as complex puzzles.

3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals**: These traits suggest a compassionate and empathetic personality, which doesn't directly correlate with computer science but also doesn't exclude it. It's more neutral in this respect.

4. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: These traits are well-suited for computer science, which often involves abstract thinking and problem-solving.

5. **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This is a general trait that could apply to any field but is definitely beneficial in the demanding and often challenging field of computer science.

Given these considerations, while not all traits directly point to computer science, the key traits related to puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence suggest a reasonable likelihood.

Combining these insights, I would estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This value reflects a moderate likelihood that his personality and interests are consistent with someone in the field of computer science.
