In order to compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context can be stated as follows:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science (A) given his personality sketch (B).
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch occurring.

Given that we do not have the exact probabilities for these values, we will provide a reasoned estimation based on the information provided.

1. **\( P(B | A) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality traits (interest in nature, solving puzzles, empathy, intelligence) given that he studies computer science. While it's not the most typical match for a computer science student, it's certainly possible. Let's estimate it as 0.3.

2. **\( P(A) \)**: The prior probability that any given graduate student is studying computer science. Given the popularity of the field, let's assume it's fairly high, around 0.2.

3. **\( P(B) \)**: The probability of someone having Adam's specific personality traits irrespective of their field of study. Since his traits are quite specific but not unique, let's estimate this as 0.4.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem gives:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = \frac{0.06}{0.4} = 0.15 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.15.
