In order to compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can employ Bayesian reasoning. 

We denote:
- P(CS) as the prior probability that Adam is studying computer science.
- P(personality sketch | CS) as the likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is studying computer science.
- P(personality sketch) as the marginal probability of Adam having this personality sketch.

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability P(CS | personality sketch) is given by:
\[ P(CS | personality sketch) = \frac{P(personality sketch | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(personality sketch)} \]

However, exact numerical values for these probabilities are not directly provided, so we must make some educated assumptions based on typical traits associated with computer science students and the general population.

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS))**:
    - We assume an equal distribution across several fields of study, without concrete data. Let's tentatively set \( P(CS) \) as 0.1 (assuming there's a broad and fairly equal interest in various fields among graduate students).

2. **Likelihood (P(personality sketch | CS))**:
    - Students in computer science often possess high intelligence, good problem-solving skills, and an understanding of abstract concepts, which aligns with Adam's traits. Therefore, a higher likelihood (let's estimate 0.7) that a computer science student fits Adam's personality sketch.

3. **Marginal Probability (P(personality sketch))**:
    - To find this, we consider how common Adamâ€™s personality traits are among all students. Given they are somewhat specialized (curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, empathy), let's assume 0.5.

Using these estimates:
\[ P(CS | personality sketch) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.5} = \frac{0.07}{0.5} = 0.14 \]

Thus:

  "computer science": "0.14"
