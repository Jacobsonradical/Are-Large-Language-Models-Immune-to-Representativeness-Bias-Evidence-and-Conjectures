To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. However, because we don't have access to the base rates (prior probabilities) of students studying different fields or the likelihoods of the observed traits given those fields, we can only provide a qualitative assessment based on the information given.

Given Adam's traits and interests:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Traits 2, 4, and 5 fit well with someone who could be studying computer science, as the field requires problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, and dedication. However, traits 1 and 3 are more aligned with biological sciences, environmental science, or a field involving direct interaction with animals.

Considering these factors, the probability is neither very high nor very low but somewhat moderate. Therefore, the posterior conditional probability can be estimated as follows:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
