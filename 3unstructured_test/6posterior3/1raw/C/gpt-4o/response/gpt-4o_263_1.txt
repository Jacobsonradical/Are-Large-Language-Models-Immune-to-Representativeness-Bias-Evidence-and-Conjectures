To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. However, since we don't have specific numerical data regarding the probabilities of each major given his traits, we'll have to rely on qualitative analysis to estimate this probability.

Bayes' Theorem formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was a computer science student given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of having Adam's personality traits given he is a computer science student.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science student.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits. 

Based on Adam's personality sketch:
- Adam has a keen curiosity about nature and plants.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- Has a warm heart, empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Appreciates hard work and dedication.

Computer science students often:
- Enjoy problem-solving and abstract thinking.
- Require intelligence and a high capacity for understanding and applying theoretical concepts.
- Need to be dedicated to succeeding in their studies.

However, Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are not typical indicators for computer science specifically; they might align more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary science. 

Given the absence of concrete numerical data, an estimated conditional probability can only be constructed from qualitative reasoning. 

Based on the qualitative analysis:

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.3 \]

This figure takes into account the fit between Adamâ€™s abstract problem-solving skills and intelligence with computer science, but also weighs in his stronger inclinations towards nature and empathy.
