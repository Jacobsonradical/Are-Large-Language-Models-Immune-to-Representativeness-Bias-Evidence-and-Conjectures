{
  "computer science": 0.4
}

My estimate is based on certain aspects of Adam's personality that align with traits often found in computer science students, such as high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and good understanding of abstract concepts. While these traits do point towards computer science, Adam's deep love for nature, plants, and animals may suggest a different field, such as biology or environmental science. Given the mixed alignment, I assign a moderate probability of 0.4 for computer science.
