To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science (CS) given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem. Unfortunately, I don't have specific numerical data to apply traditional Bayesian analysis, but I can provide a qualitative assessment based on Adam's traits.

Here's the personality sketch summary:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciates hard work and dedication

The field of computer science often attracts people who enjoy solving puzzles and have high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts. However, the strong empathy and love for nature and animals might sometimes be more prominently associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies.

Given these considerations, we can make a reasonable qualitative estimate. While we can't assign a precise number, the blend of Adam's traits provides a balanced perspective between various fields. Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science may not be extremely high but still within a reasonable range.

Here's the formatted response:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Note: This is a subjective estimate, and actual probability could vary based on more context-specific data.
