Computing the exact posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch would typically require access to prior probabilities and the likelihood of different fields given the personality traits. However, based on the provided personality sketch alone, I can offer an educated estimate on how well it aligns with a typical computer science profile.

Adam's traits include:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet demeanor
- Enjoying solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Those traits relevant to computer science include high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoyment in solving puzzles, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. While these align well with computer science, his deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and strong empathy might also align with fields like biology or environmental science.

Given these considerations, I'll provide an estimated value:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
