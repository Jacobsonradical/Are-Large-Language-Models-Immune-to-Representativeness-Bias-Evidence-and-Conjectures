To compute the posterior conditional probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of event B occurring given that A is true.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of event A occurring given that B is true.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability of B.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability of A.

For our purpose:
- Let \( B \) be the event that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- Let \( A \) be Adam's personality traits and characteristics.

Therefore, we need to determine:
1. \( P(A|B) \): The probability of Adam having these personality traits if he is in computer science.
2. \( P(B) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science.
3. \( P(A) \): The overall probability of Adam having these personality traits.

Given the lack of specific numerical data, I'll justify general assumptions:

1. \( P(A|B) \): Many students in computer science have high intelligence and are good at understanding abstract concepts. However, a deep love for nature and empathy for animals may not be as prevalent. Let's assume \( P(A|B) \approx 0.3 \).

2. \( P(B) \): Roughly estimating, letâ€™s assume that around 20% of graduate students are in computer science. So, \( P(B) = 0.2 \).

3. \( P(A) \): This might be trickier, as we must consider how common these personality traits are among graduate students in general. Given Adam's empathy, love for nature, and intelligence, let's assume \( P(A) \approx 0.1 \).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(A)} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.1} = \frac{0.06}{0.1} = 0.6 \]

So, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality traits is approximately 0.6.
