To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' theorem. However, because we lack specific statistical data to definitively calculate probabilities, we'll provide a qualitative assessment based on the information given.

Given Information about Adam:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: This aligns more with fields like Biology, Botany, Environmental Science, or Ecology rather than Computer Science.
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles: This trait could align with Computer Science, where problem-solving is pivotal.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: These traits are more common in fields like Biology, Veterinary Science, or Zoology.
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts: This is a strong trait for success in Computer Science.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: This is a general trait beneficial in any field, including Computer Science.

Based on the qualitative match to Adam's personality traits, the probability is not high given his strong inclination towards nature and animals. However, his intelligence and puzzle-solving capabilities align well with Computer Science. Therefore, we'll balance these considerations to provide an estimated probability.
