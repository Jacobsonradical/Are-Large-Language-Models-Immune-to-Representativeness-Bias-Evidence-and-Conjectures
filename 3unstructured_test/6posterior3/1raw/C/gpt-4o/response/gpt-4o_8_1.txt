To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider his traits and how they correlate with the field of computer science. However, providing an exact value requires detailed statistical data on student characteristics across different fields, which isn't provided here. Instead, I'll assess the likelihood based on the given traits and general assumptions:

- Curiosity about nature and plants may suggest a leaning towards biological sciences, environmental science, or related fields.
- Enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are traits that align well with computer science.
- Strong empathy and love for animals might suggest a potential interest in zoology, veterinary science, or related fields, but does not exclude computer science.

Given these considerations, while Adam's curiosity about nature leans him slightly towards biological sciences, his enjoyment of puzzles, intelligence, and abstract thinking significantly align with traits often found in computer science students.

Therefore, we can hypothesize a moderate probability that he might be in computer science, though it is not overwhelmingly certain.

This value reflects a moderate likelihood, acknowledging both his alignment with computer science attributes and his naturalistic interests.
