To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would typically use Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can only assess a rough subjective estimate based on the given data.

Given Adamâ€™s strong intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and understanding of abstract concepts, these traits are generally favorable for a field like computer science. However, his deep love for animals, empathy, and curiosity about nature might lean towards fields such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary science.

Despite these considerations, the fact that he enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence are strong indicators for computer science. Given these mixed but relevant traits, a reasonable subjective estimate could be around 0.4.
