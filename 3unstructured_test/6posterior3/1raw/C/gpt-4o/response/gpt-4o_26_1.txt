To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would ideally use Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities or any likelihood functions, we can only make an educated guess based on the provided traits and their relevance to computer science.

- **Curiosity about nature and plants**: This trait is often less explicitly aligned with fields like computer science.
- **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This strongly aligns with computer science, as it involves problem-solving and logical thinking.
- **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals**: While these traits are somewhat uncommon focal points in computer science, they do not directly preclude it. 
- **High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts**: This is very relevant, as computer science requires abstract thinking and intelligence.
- **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This aligns well with the rigorous nature of computer science studies.
- **Graduate student in the U.S.**: Computer science is a common field for graduate studies in the U.S., especially for intelligent individuals with good problem-solving abilities.

Given the aforementioned points, here's a reasonable estimation:

{
  "computer science": 0.4
}

This represents a moderate likelihood, given some traits directly align with computer science, while others suggest a broader academic interest possibly encompassing other scientific or engineering disciplines.
