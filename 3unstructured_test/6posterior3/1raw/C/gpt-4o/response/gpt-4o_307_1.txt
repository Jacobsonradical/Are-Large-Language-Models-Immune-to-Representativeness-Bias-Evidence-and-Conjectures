Given Adam's personality sketch, we need to estimate the posterior conditional probability that he was enrolled in computer science (CS). We will consider the traits provided and assess how well they align with typical characteristics of CS students.

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants:** This trait does not strongly suggest CS, as such curiosity is often associated with biology, environmental science, or related fields.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles:** This is a strong indicator for CS, as problem-solving and puzzle-solving are central to programming and algorithm design.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals:** These traits typically align more with fields that involve interpersonal interactions, such as psychology, medicine, or veterinary sciences, but they don't exclude CS.
4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts:** This is a positive indicator for CS, as abstract thinking is crucial in the field.
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication:** This trait can apply to many fields, including CS, but it is not exclusive or particularly indicative.

Taking all these factors into consideration, the traits that directly align with CS are his enjoyment of solving puzzles and his intelligence/abstract thinking. The other traits, while positive, are either neutral or slightly suggest fields that are not as closely associated with CS.

Therefore, based on Adam's personality sketch, we estimate the posterior conditional probability that he was enrolled in computer science as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This value acknowledges the strong indicators for CS while also accounting for the traits that are not directly aligned with it.
