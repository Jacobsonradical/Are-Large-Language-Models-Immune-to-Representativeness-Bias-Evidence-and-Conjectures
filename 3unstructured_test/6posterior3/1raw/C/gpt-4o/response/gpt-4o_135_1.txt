To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, we apply Bayes' Theorem. This theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

For our scenario:
- \( A \) represents Adam being enrolled in computer science.
- \( B \) represents Adam's personality traits.

First, we need to estimate the following probabilities:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is in computer science.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of observing Adam’s personality traits given that he is in computer science.
3. \( P(B) \): The total probability of observing Adam’s personality traits across all fields.

Given that we do not have exact statistical data, we will make some qualitative assumptions:

1. \( P(A) \): According to education statistics, computer science is a popular field, but not the most common. Let's assume roughly 20% of graduate students are in computer science.

2. \( P(B|A) \): We evaluate how well Adam's personality traits fit with being a computer science student:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants: This is somewhat relevant, as computer science students can be curious.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles: This is highly relevant, as many computer science students like problem-solving.
   - Strong empathy and love for animals: This is less directly relevant but doesn't contradict being a computer science student.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: This is highly relevant for computer science.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Again, very relevant.
   
   Let's assign \( P(B|A) \) a high probability, say 0.75, because most traits are conducive to being a computer science student.

3. \( P(B) \): We also consider how common Adam's traits are among all graduate students. Suppose this is moderately common. Let's assume \( P(B) = 0.50 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75 \cdot 0.20}{0.50} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.50} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.30 \]

So, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is 0.30.
