To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. However, we don't have specific prior probabilities and likelihoods provided in the query. Despite this, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided.

### Educated estimation:

- **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Less correlated with computer science.
- **Enjoys solving puzzles**: High correlation with computer science.
- **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals**: These traits are neutral or could slightly correlate negatively with computer science, preferring fields like biology, veterinary sciences, or psychology.
- **High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts**: Strong correlation with computer science.
- **Understands and appreciates hard work and dedication**: Neutral or positively correlated with any field including computer science.

Combining these observations, Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and aptitude for abstract concepts strongly fit the profile of a computer science student, while his love for nature and animals might push towards a different field. However, the key strengths relevant to succeeding in computer science prominently stand out.

Therefore, making an educated guess:

{
  "computer science": 0.6
