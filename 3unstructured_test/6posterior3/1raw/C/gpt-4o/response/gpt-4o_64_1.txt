To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how traits described in the sketch intersect with typical characteristics and interests of computer science students. 

The Bayesian approach to this problem involves calculating the likelihood of the personality traits given enrollment in computer science and the overall probability of enrollment in computer science among graduate students.

However, without quantitative data on base rates of personality attributes among computer science students or base rates of graduate enrollment in computer science, we cannot provide a precise value. Instead, we can discuss the likelihood qualitatively and make an educated estimate based on the description.

Adam’s traits include:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

The traits that may align well with computer science are:
- Enjoys solving puzzles (programming often involves solving logical problems)
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts (important for understanding complex algorithms)

However, some traits are less directly related to typical computer science attributes:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants (more common in life sciences)
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals (less indicative of computer science, though not exclusive)

Given these points, we might estimate the conditional probability based on narrative alignment without precise quantitative data. Considering a moderately strong alignment but the possible diversity of Adam’s interests, we might set our qualitative assessment roughly in the middle range.
