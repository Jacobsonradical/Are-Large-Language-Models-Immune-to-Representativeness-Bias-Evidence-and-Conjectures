To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of Adam having his personality traits given he is in computer science.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \(P(B)\) is the probability of Adam having his personality traits.

Let's break it down:

1. **Estimate \( P(A) \):** The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is studying computer science. Let's assume it's around 1 in 10, or \( P(A) \approx 0.1 \).

2. **Estimate \( P(B|A) \):** The probability of having Adam's personality given that he is in computer science. Adam's empathy, love for nature, and animals are not commonly definitive traits of typical computer science students, though his intelligence and puzzling skills may fit. Let's assign it an approximate value: \( P(B|A) \approx 0.3 \).

3. **Estimate \( P(B) \):** The overall probability of a graduate student having Adam's personality traits, irrespective of the field. Given Adam's traits are quite unique, we might estimate it to be \( P(B) \approx 0.05 \).

Now, we can compute \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.05} = \frac{0.03}{0.05} = 0.6 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is:
