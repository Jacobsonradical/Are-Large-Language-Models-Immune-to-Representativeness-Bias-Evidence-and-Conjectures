To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, one would typically apply Bayes' theorem. However, without specific data or prior probabilities regarding the enrollment distribution and personality traits across different fields of study, it's not possible to provide a precise numerical value. Instead, I can offer a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch provided.

Let's consider the traits given:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits could be relevant to many fields of study including computer science. However, some traits like curiosity about nature and love for animals might typically be more associated with fields such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies. On the other hand, traits such as enjoying solving puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science.

Given the qualitative analysis, we might estimate the posterior conditional probability for computer science to be somewhere in the middle range, neither too high nor too low, considering both the supportive and less supportive evidence.

  "computer science": 0.5

This is a cautious estimate in the absence of precise data and priors, acknowledging the balancing evidence provided by Adam's diverse interests and qualities.
