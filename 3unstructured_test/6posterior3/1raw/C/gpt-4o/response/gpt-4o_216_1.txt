To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. While we don't have specific numerical data to perform an exact calculation, we can make a subjective estimation based on the provided personality traits.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that hypothesis A is true given evidence B.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of observing evidence B given that hypothesis A is true.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis A being true.
- \(P(B)\) is the overall probability of observing evidence B.

For this specific case:
- A: Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- B: The personality traits provided in the sketch.

Given Adam's characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- Quiet demeanor, enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm-hearted, strong empathy, love for animals.
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits align somewhat with fields like biology, environmental science, and psychology. However, the traits of intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, along with puzzle-solving could also align with computer science. 

Considering these points and the broad applicability of computer science to virtually all fields, the probability is non-zero but perhaps not overwhelmingly high because other factors like his love for animals and nature could steer him towards other sciences.

A reasonable subjective estimation might be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This reflects that while there is a chance Adam could be in computer science, given his interest in nature and animals, there might be higher probabilities for other fields.
