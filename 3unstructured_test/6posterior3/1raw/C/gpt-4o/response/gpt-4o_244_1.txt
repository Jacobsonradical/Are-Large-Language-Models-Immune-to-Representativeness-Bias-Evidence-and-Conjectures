Computing the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch involves considering the relevance of his traits to the field.

Let's break down Adam's personality traits in relation to computer science:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants** - This trait suggests an interest in natural sciences and might not strongly relate to computer science.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles** - High relevance to computer science, as problem-solving is a fundamental skill in this field.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals** - These traits are more aligned with fields that involve direct human or animal interaction, such as psychology, biology, or veterinary science, and may not be highly indicative of a computer science background.
4. **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts** - Strong alignment with computer science, which often requires dealing with abstract thinking and complex problem-solving.
5. **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication** - Relevant to virtually any field, including computer science, indicating a strong work ethic.

Given these points, we can infer that while some of Adam's traits align with computer science, others suggest he might be interested in fields more directly related to nature and life sciences. Although he does enjoy solving puzzles and has the capability to understand abstract concepts, the probability isn't overwhelming given the entire personality profile.

Given this qualitative analysis, let's assign a reasonable probability:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

This value indicates that while there is a significant possibility that Adam could be in computer science due to his problem-solving skills and intelligence, his interests in nature and empathy lower this probability somewhat.
