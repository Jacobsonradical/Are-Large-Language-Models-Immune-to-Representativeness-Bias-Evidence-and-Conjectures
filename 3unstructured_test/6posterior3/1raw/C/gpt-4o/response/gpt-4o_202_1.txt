To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of observing Adam's personality traits, considering all fields of study.

Given the qualitative nature of the data, we'll make reasonable assumptions based on common knowledge and logical inferences.

1. **\( P(B|A) \):** The likelihood of Adam’s traits in computer science.
   - Curiosity, abstract thinking, puzzle-solving can align well with computer science.
   - Empathy and a love for nature and animals might be less prevalent but not incongruent with computer science.
   - Assume \( P(B|A) \approx 0.6 \).

2. **\( P(A) \):** The prior probability of being in computer science.
   - Graduate programs often have a significant number of students in computer science.
   - Assume \( P(A) \approx 0.2 \).

3. **\( P(B) \):** The overall probability of Adam’s traits.
   - Traits like curiosity, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking are reasonably common across many disciplines.
   - Empathy and love for nature/animals add some specificity.
   - Assume \( P(B) \approx 0.3 \).

Using these estimates:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.3} \]

\[ P(A|B) = 0.4 \]

So the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.4.
