To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we'd typically rely on Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality traits.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is a computer science student.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \(P(B)\) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits.

We would need data on the following to calculate these probabilities accurately:
1. The proportion of computer science graduate students among all graduate students (\(P(A)\)).
2. The likelihood of a computer science student having the particular traits described in Adam's personality sketch (\(P(B|A)\)).
3. The overall likelihood of any graduate student having these traits (\(P(B)\)).

Without specific empirical data, we can only make a qualitative assessment. Given the traits described:
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Lower associated probability with computer science.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles: Higher associated probability with computer science.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: Higher associated probability with computer science.

Assuming that computer science students make up a significant portion of the graduate student population, and considering that some of his traits do align with those of a typical computer science student (e.g., solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts), I'd estimate the probability to be moderate.

Let's make a reasoned estimate here:

{
  "computer science": 0.4
}

This is a moderately high probability, reflecting the combination of fitting and non-fitting traits for computer science students.
