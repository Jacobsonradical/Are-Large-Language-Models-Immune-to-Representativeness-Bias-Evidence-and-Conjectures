To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would ideally use Bayesian inference. However, without specific prior probabilities (base rates) and likelihoods for each field given Adam's attributes, it is not possible to compute an exact numerical probability. Instead, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the given traits:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**: This could suggest a field like biology, botany, or environmental science more than computer science.
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**: This trait aligns well with computer science, which often requires patience and problem-solving skills.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals**: These traits may be more commonly associated with fields like veterinary science, psychology, or medicine.
4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: This is a key trait for success in computer science, as well as other technical and scientific fields.
5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This trait is likely to be common across many fields, including computer science.

Given these points, Adam's empathy and love for nature point him more towards fields related to life sciences, but his problem-solving skills and high intelligence could indeed make him suitable for computer science. However, computer science does not directly align with his love for nature and animals. Therefore, considering these traits qualitatively, we can give a moderate posterior probability for computer science.
