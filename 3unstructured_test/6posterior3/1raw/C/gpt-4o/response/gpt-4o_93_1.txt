To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can frame this within a Bayesian context. Note, however, that such probability is relatively informal without detailed base rate data (priors) or likelihoods from specific studies. 

We can consider the personality traits and attempt to qualitatively assess the likelihood that a person with such traits would be found in the computer science field.

1. **Interest in Nature and Plants**: This is generally associated more with biological sciences or environmental science, less directly with computer science.
   
2. **Enjoying Solving Puzzles**: This is a trait that aligns well with computer science, as it involves logical problem solving.

3. **High Intelligence and Understanding Abstract Concepts**: This trait significantly aligns with most STEM fields, particularly computer science where abstract thinking is crucial.

4. **Empathy and Warm Heart**: While these are positive traits, they are not directly indicative of any particular field but could suggest an interest in human-centered fields like psychology, social sciences, or even interdisciplinary areas like Human-Computer Interaction.

5. **Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication**: This is a trait that supports success in many fields, including computer science.

Given these assessments, we can lean towards a qualitative estimate. 

Overall, Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators for computer science. Thus:

{
  "computer science": 0.65
}
  
This is a rough estimate given the nature of the traits and the field. In a real-world scenario, specific data about the distribution of such traits among computer science students and comparative data with other fields might help to refine this probability.
