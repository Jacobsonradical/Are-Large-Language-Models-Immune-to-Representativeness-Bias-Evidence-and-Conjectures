To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider both Adam's personality traits and how they align with the characteristics typically associated with students in computer science.

Given traits:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
2. Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles
3. Warm heart and strong empathy
4. Deep love for animals
5. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
6. Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Field Considerations:
- Computer Science students often exhibit high intelligence and strong skills in solving abstract problems, aligning with Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles.
- While computer science does not inherently relate to a curiosity about nature and plants or a deep love for animals, these personal interests do not preclude someone from studying computer science.

Given these considerations, here is a reasonable estimate of the probability:

{
  "computer science": 0.4
}

This estimation suggests that while some of Adam's characteristics strongly align with those typical of computer science students (intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities), his other interests may make him just as likely to pursue another field. Therefore, the probability is moderate rather than high.
