To estimate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider not only his traits but also the likelihood that such traits are commonly associated with computer science students. Adam's love for solving puzzles and his high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts are significant indicators that align with the nature of computer science. However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication might not be as directly correlated with computer science students but don't contradict it either.

Let's denote:
- P(CS | Personality): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- P(Personality | CS): The likelihood of Adam having these personality traits given that he is in computer science.
- P(CS): The prior probability that any random student is in computer science.
- P(Personality): The overall probability of observing the given personality traits in the general student population.

Given the traits:
- Problem-solving and abstract thinking (high correlation with computer science)
- High intelligence (generally high among graduate students)
- Empathy and love for animals (not typical but not exclusive of computer science)

Using Bayesian inference, we consider the following:
- Computer Science students often exhibit problem-solving skills and high intelligence.
- Empathy and a love for animals don't rule out computer science but also fit other fields such as biology or psychology.

Assuming a non-formal Bayesian approach and weighting the strongest indications:

{
  "computer science": 0.6
}

This value represents a reasonably strong likelihood that Adam could be in computer science considering his problem-solving skills and intelligence, balanced with his other less correlated traits.
