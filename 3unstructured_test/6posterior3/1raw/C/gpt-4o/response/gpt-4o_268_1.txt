This estimate considers Adam's high intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of abstract concepts â€” all traits that align well with the field of computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and deep interest in nature might lead him toward fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies. Thus, while there is a reasonable probability that Adam pursued computer science, these other factors slightly lower the likelihood.
