Sure, let's analyze the information given and apply some reasoning to estimate the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the details of his personality sketch.

First, let's break down Adamâ€™s characteristics:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart and strong empathy.
4. Deep love for animals.
5. High intelligence and good at abstract concepts.
6. Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

While Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, might suggest a field related to biology or environmental science, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are traits that could also align well with computer science.

Computer science, as a field, often involves solving complex problems, working with abstract concepts, and requires a high level of intelligence and a strong work ethic.

Given these considerations, it seems reasonable to allocate a non-trivial posterior probability to the possibility of Adam being enrolled in computer science.

Considering the information given and combining general intuition about the distribution of graduate students in various fields, an estimated conditional posterior probability can be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

This value reflects the possibility, tempered by the fact that some of his traits strongly align with fields like biology or environmental sciences as well.
