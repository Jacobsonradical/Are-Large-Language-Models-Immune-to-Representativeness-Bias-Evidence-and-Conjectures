To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we must consider the traits provided and how they correlate with typical characteristics of graduate students in computer science. This calculation would typically require specific base rates and likelihood ratios, which we don't have here. However, we can make an educated guess based on qualitative analysis.

Traits such as high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, problem-solving skills, and appreciation for hard work fit well with computer science. However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature might suggest a different field.

Given the information:
- High intelligence and problem-solving are very relevant for computer science.
- Strong empathy and love for animals might suggest biosciences, psychology, or environmental sciences.
- Curiosity about nature leans towards environmental sciences or biology.

The combination of all these traits makes it plausible but not overwhelmingly certain that he could be in computer science. 

Given these considerations, a reasonable estimate might be around 0.5 to reflect the mixed relevance of the traits provided.
