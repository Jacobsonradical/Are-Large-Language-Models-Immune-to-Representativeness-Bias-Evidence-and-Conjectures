To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we consider the provided characteristics and how they align with typical attributes of individuals in the computer science field. 

Adam's characteristics:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
2. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
3. Warm-hearted with strong empathy and a love for animals
4. Intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts
5. Appreciates hard work and dedication

In relation to computer science:
- Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators that align well with computer science skills.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work also align well with the demands of computer science.
- Curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals are less directly related, but they do not preclude someone from being in the computer science field.

Given these factors, the characteristics most strongly associated with computer science (solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, high intelligence, and dedication) are present in Adam's personality sketch.

Thus, while some characteristics are less typical, the strong alignment with key attributes gives a moderate-to-high probability.

Based on this qualitative assessment, we can assign a posterior conditional probability.
