To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider several factors including the prevalence of computer science as a graduate field, the alignment of Adam's interests and skills with the field of computer science, and any additional specific data we might have about Adam that could sway our judgment.

1. **Prevalence of Computer Science as a Graduate Field**: Computer science is a popular field for graduate studies in the U.S., so there is a reasonably high base rate for students enrolling in computer science.

2. **Alignment of Interests and Skills**: 
   - **High Intelligence and Understanding Abstract Concepts**: Computer science requires a high level of intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts, which aligns well with Adam's qualities.
   - **Curiosity and Puzzle Solving**: Enjoyment of solving puzzles is highly relevant to computer science, as problem-solving is a core aspect of the field. 
   - **Empathy and Warm Heart**: While these traits are less directly relevant to computer science, they do not preclude it and might be beneficial in areas such as user experience design or ethical AI.
   - **Appreciation of Hard Work and Dedication**: These traits are advantageous in any academic field, including computer science.
   - **Love for Nature and Plants**: This interest may seem less directly related to computer science, but interdisciplinary fields such as bioinformatics or environmental modeling might integrate these interests.

Given the strong alignment of some key traits with computer science and the high base rate of enrollment in computer science graduate programs, the probability is reasonably high. However, the love for nature and plants suggests Adam might also consider fields like biology or environmental science.

Considering these points, it is sensible to provide a conditional probability estimate within the higher range but not absolute certainty.
