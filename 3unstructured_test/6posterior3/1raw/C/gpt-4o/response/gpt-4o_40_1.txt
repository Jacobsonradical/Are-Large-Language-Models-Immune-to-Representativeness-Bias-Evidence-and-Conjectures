To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Although we don't have specific quantitative data for prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the provided information.

Adam's personality sketch indicates:
- A genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals.
- High intelligence, good at abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits could align with several fields, including computer science, but also biology, environmental science, psychology, and other fields that value abstract thinking and problem-solving.

Let's roughly assess the relevance to computer science:
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles: highly relevant.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: highly relevant.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: relevant.
- Curiosity about nature and plants: less directly relevant to computer science but could be part of interdisciplinary interests.

Based on these qualitative assessments, I'd estimate the conditional probability as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.25
}

This assumes that while Adam's traits make him somewhat likely to be in computer science, they also match well with several other fields.
