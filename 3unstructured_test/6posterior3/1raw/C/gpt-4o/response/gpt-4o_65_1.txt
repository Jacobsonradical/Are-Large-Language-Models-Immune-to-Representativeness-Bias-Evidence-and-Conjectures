To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we have to consider various factors including base rates of different fields among graduate students, the typical personality traits associated with fields, and any overlap between Adam's traits and those that might be prevalent in computer science.

Adam's personality traits such as genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, empathy, and strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are quite universal and might be found in a number of fields, including computer science. However, fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or even animal science might also match his personality traits well.

Given the information:

1. **Prior Probability**: The general proportion of graduate students in computer science in the US.
2. **Likelihood**: The commonality of traits like enjoying puzzles and high intelligence in computer science.
3. **Posterior Probability**: Considering the alignment of his specific personality with computer science.

Empathy and a deep love for animals might usually be less associated with computer science compared to fields like biology or psychology.

Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence, which are strong indicators for computer science students, we can assume a moderately high likelihood for computer science.

Using subjective Bayesian inference, we can make an educated estimate for the posterior probability.

{
  "computer science": 0.4
}

This estimate assumes that while Adam's love for animals and nature might suggest other fields, his affinity for puzzles and high intelligence are significant indicators for computer science, though not overwhelmingly so.
