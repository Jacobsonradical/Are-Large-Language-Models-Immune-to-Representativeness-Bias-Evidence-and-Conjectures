To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would ideally need more detailed data about the base rates of each field among graduate students and how Adam's characteristics map to likelihoods for each specific field. However, given the provided information, I can offer a qualitative estimation.

Adam's interests and skills suggest certain affinities:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Love for animals.
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
- Warm heart and strong empathy.
- Enjoy solving puzzles.

Let's consider each of these factors in the context of computer science:
- Curiosity about nature and plants and a love of animals might not directly correlate with computer science.
- High intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts are certainly advantageous in computer science.
- Enjoying solving puzzles aligns well with computer science, especially areas such as algorithm design, cryptography, and data science.
- Empathy is generally less emphasized in technical fields but could be beneficial in user-centered design and collaborative work in computer science.

Given the strengths in puzzles and abstract thinking, combined with an indirect but not strong alignment with nature and empathy aspects, we might reasonably estimate that there's a notable but not overwhelming likelihood Adam could be in computer science.
