To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to assess how well his characteristics align with the typical traits of someone in that field.

Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet and enjoys puzzles
- Warm-hearted, empathetic, and loves animals
- High intelligence and good at abstract concepts
- Appreciates hard work and dedication

Given these traits, let's evaluate:

- Curiosity about nature and plants: This doesn't directly correlate with computer science but indicates a scientific mindset.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Highly relevant, as computer science requires problem-solving skills.
- Warm-hearted, empathetic, and loves animals: Not directly relevant but shows a well-rounded personality.
- High intelligence and good at abstract concepts: Highly relevant, as computer science often involves dealing with abstract problems and theories.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant, as computer science programs are rigorous and require sustained effort. 

Considering these points, Adam does have several traits that align well with those commonly found in computer science, particularly his puzzle-solving skills, intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts.

Hence, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch might not be very high but still significant.
