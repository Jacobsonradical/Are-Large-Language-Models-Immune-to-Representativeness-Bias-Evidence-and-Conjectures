To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider the match between the characteristics described and the typical attributes of students in the field of computer science. However, computing a precise probabilistic value would require extensive data about the distribution of personality traits in various fields, which exceeds the information available here.

We can, however, make a qualitative assessment based on common knowledge and the information provided. 

### Reasoning:
1. **Genuine Curiosity about Nature and Plants**: This trait aligns more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, or botany than with computer science.
2. **Enjoys Solving Puzzles**: This aligns well with computer science, as problem-solving and logical thinking are key components.
3. **Warm Heart, Strong Empathy, and Deep Love for Animals**: These traits might suggest a person-oriented field such as veterinary science, psychology, or social work, rather than the typically more technical and less directly human-focused field of computer science.
4. **High Intelligence and Understanding of Abstract Concepts**: This aligns well with computer science, where abstract thinking is crucial.
5. **Strong Understanding and Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication**: This is a trait that is broadly applicable to many fields, including computer science.

Overall, there are traits in Adam's personality sketch that align with computer science, notably enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, but other traits like his love for nature, animals, and empathy might align him more naturally to other fields.

Considering these factors, I would assign a qualitative posterior conditional probability in a quantitative manner based on the match to computer science:

{
  "computer science": 0.4
}

This value is below 0.5 because while there are significant matches (like problem-solving and abstract thinking), other strong personality traits suggest a better fit with non-computer science fields.
