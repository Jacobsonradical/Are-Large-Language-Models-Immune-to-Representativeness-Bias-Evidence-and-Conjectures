To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would typically use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. However, since we do not have specific prior probabilities and likelihoods for Adam's characteristics, we need to make educated assumptions based on the information provided.

Given his interests and personality:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants - May suggest an inclination towards natural sciences, biology, or environmental science rather than computer science.
2. Enjoying solving puzzles - This characteristic aligns well with computer science, as it often involves problem-solving.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals - These traits may align more with fields like biology, veterinary science, or psychology.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts - This is a strong indicator for suitability for computer science, as it requires abstract thinking and problem-solving skills.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication - This trait is valuable in any field, including computer science.

Given the mixed signals but recognizing the relevance of problem-solving and abstract thinking to computer science, I'll provide an estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

This value represents a moderate likelihood that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on his personality traits, acknowledging that while some traits strongly fit, others suggest possible interests in different fields.
