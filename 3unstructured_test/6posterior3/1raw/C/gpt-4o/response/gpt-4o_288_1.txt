To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider the likelihood of his traits and interests aligning with a typical computer science student, as well as prior probabilities of students in various fields. However, without specific empirical data on the distribution of student characteristics across different fields, it is challenging to provide an exact numerical value. Instead, I will analyze the likelihood based on the provided personality traits and their relevance to computer science.

Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has a strong empathy, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciates hard work and dedication. 

Traits relevant to Computer Science:

1. Enjoys solving puzzles: High relevance. Problem-solving is a central skill in computer science.
2. High intelligence: High relevance. Computer science typically requires a strong intellectual ability.
3. Understanding abstract concepts: High relevance. Computer science frequently involves dealing with abstract thinking and concepts.

Traits less directly relevant:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants: Low relevance. This is more related to life sciences or environmental studies.
2. Strong empathy and deep love for animals: Medium relevance. These traits are less central to computer science but don't necessarily exclude it.

Given these considerations, the probability is moderate but not overwhelmingly high, as some traits are quite relevant while others are more aligned with different fields. With qualitative reasoning, a reasonable posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on his personality sketch might be around 0.5.
