To determine the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to rely on both the traits exhibited by Adam and any relevant domain knowledge about what might be typical characteristics for students in this field. This reasoning involves applying Bayesian reasoning qualitatively, as we don't have actual numerical probabilities to plug into Bayes' theorem. 

Nonetheless, based on Adam's personality:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Given these traits:
1. Enjoying puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts align well with skills and interests typical of computer science students.
2. His strong empathy and love for animals might point towards fields like biology, environmental science, or related fields where these traits are highly relevant.

While it's not exclusively determinative, there is a reasonable likelihood that someone with Adam's traits might have an interest in computer science. Nevertheless, the traits pointing towards a strong empathy and love for animals might reduce the probability he is in computer science compared to fields closely related to his interests in nature and animals.

Thus, while we would need more context or data to be precise, a qualitative consideration may lead us to estimate a moderate probability:
