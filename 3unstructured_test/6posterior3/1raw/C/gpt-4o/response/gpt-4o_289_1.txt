To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{computer science} | \text{personality sketch}) = \frac{P(\text{personality sketch} | \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(\text{personality sketch})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{computer science} | \text{personality sketch}) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(\text{personality sketch} | \text{computer science}) \) is the likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch if he is in computer science.
- \( P(\text{computer science}) \) is the prior probability of a student being enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(\text{personality sketch}) \) is the overall probability of observing this personality sketch.

Given that we do not have the actual values for the likelihoods and priors, we can qualitatively assess how well Adam's personality fits a typical computer science student and use that to estimate the probability:

1. **Intellectual Curiosity and Intelligence**: People in computer science often exhibit high intelligence and curiosity (relevant to problem-solving).
2. **Solving Puzzles**: This is highly relevant as computer science involves problem-solving.
3. **Warm Heart, Empathy, and Love for Animals**: These traits are not typically differentiating for or against computer science unless the specific area of focus involves ethical computing or robotics with a focus on animal behavior.
4. **Understanding and Appreciation for Hard Work**: This is generally positive as computer science can be demanding.

Considering the above traits and how they align with the characteristics of computer science students:

\[ P(\text{personality sketch} | \text{computer science}) \] might be moderately high.
\[ P(\text{computer science}) \] can vary but it's a popular field, so let's assume it's not extraordinarily high or low.
\[ P(\text{personality sketch}) \] depends on how common such a personality sketch is among all fields.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can estimate a moderately high probability but not 1 (which would indicate certainty).

This indicates a high but not absolute confidence that Adam, given his personality traits, could be enrolled in computer science.
