To calculate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, we would ideally need a prior probability distribution of students enrolled in various fields of study, as well as likelihoods derived from the personality traits provided. Since we don't have specific data, we need to rely on a reasoned estimation based on the given information:

1. Adam has a curiosity about nature and plants.
2. He's quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy, and loves animals.
3. He has high intelligence and understands abstract concepts.
4. Appreciates hard work and dedication.
5. He was a graduate student in 2021.

Given his personality traits, fields that seem to directly correlate with his interests and traits include biology, environmental science, and possibly psychology or cognitive sciences. Computer science also deals with solving puzzles and abstract concepts, but it may not directly align with his love for nature, plants, and animals.

Taking all this into account, we could estimate the posterior probability for Adam being enrolled in computer science, though admitting it's speculative without precise data.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

The value of 0.3 (or 30%) reflects a reasonable probability that aligns with Adam's trait of enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, while also considering that his primary interests might lie more towards nature-related fields.
