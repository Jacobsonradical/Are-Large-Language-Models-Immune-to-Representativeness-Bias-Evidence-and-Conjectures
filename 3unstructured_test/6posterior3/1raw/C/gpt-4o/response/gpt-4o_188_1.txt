To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would ideally use Bayes' theorem. However, without concrete numerical data regarding base rates or likelihoods, we must rely on a qualitative assessment.

Adam's personality traits, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, don't strongly align with or contradict specific aspects of computer science. Nonetheless, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence can be relevant to computer science.

Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) = Enrollment in computer science
- \( B \) = Personality traits described

Given limited exact data to compute numerical probabilities and relying on a qualitative approach:

- \( P(A) \) (prior probability of enrollment in computer science): Relatively moderate to high given the popularity of the field.
- \( P(B|A) \) (likelihood of described personality traits given enrollment in computer science): Somewhat moderate as puzzle-solving and intelligence are relevant, but nature and animals less so.
- \( P(B) \) (overall probability of the described personality traits): Could occur in various fields, not particularly unique to computer science.

Thus, considering both supportive and non-supportive factors:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

This value is a subjective estimate reflecting a moderate probability, accounting for the alignment and misalignment of the described traits with typical characteristics of computer science students.
