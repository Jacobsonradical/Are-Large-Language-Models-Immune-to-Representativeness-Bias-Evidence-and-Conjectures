To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would typically use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch in the general population of graduate students.

However, to provide an exact numerical value, specific data would be required for these probabilities, which is generally beyond the scope of a simple analysis. Here, we will make some reasoned estimations based on common knowledge and the given information.

1. **\( P(A) \) - Prior Probability for Computer Science:**
   Generally, computer science is a common field of study among graduate students in the U.S., but it's not the most common field. Let's assume \( P(A) \) = 0.1 (10%).

2. **\( P(B|A) \) - Likelihood of Personality Traits Given Computer Science:**
   Adam's traits include high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles, which are relevant to computer science. However, traits like a strong curiosity about nature and deep love for animals might be less typical. Assuming a moderate probability, let's estimate \( P(B|A) \) = 0.4.

3. **\( P(B) \) - Overall Probability of Personality Traits:**
   These traits can apply to a wide array of disciplines, not just computer science. Assuming a diverse set of graduate students with various interests, let's estimate \( P(B) \) = 0.2.

Given these assumptions:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = 0.2 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is 0.2 (20%).
