To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can look at the aspects of his personality that align with the characteristics and skills typically needed for a computer science student. However, please note that without specific prior and likelihood information, this process is somewhat subjective, and any value provided will be an educated guess.

Adam exhibits the following traits and interests:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Quiet and enjoys puzzles.
3. Warm-hearted, empathetic, and loves animals.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Strong understanding and appreciation of hard work and dedication.

Given these traits, here are some points to consider:
- Enjoying solving puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also important traits for a computer science student.
- His love for nature and animals and empathy might not be directly related to computer science, but they do not conflict with it either.
  
Overall, based on the traits relevant to computer science (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work), there is a reasonable probability that Adam could be enrolled in a field like computer science. 

Given the subjective nature of the calculation, an estimated value might be:

{
  "computer science": 0.6
