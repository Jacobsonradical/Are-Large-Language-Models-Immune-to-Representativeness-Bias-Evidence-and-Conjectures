To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we must use an interpretation based on the personality traits described.

Bayes' Theorem in this context can be formulated as:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

Given the sketch:

Adam's traits like high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science. Curiosity and problem-solving skills also align with this field. However, Adam's empathy, deep love for animals, and nature may suggest other fields possibly related to biology or life sciences as well.

Without quantitative measures, we assess that the likeliness of enrolling in computer science is reasonably high but not overwhelmingly dominant.

Considering these subjective assessments, a reasonable posterior probability for computer science could be estimated within 0 and 1. Given the qualitative alignment particularly with the intelligence and problem-solving skills, an educated guess might look like:

  "computer science": 0.6
