To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well Adam’s personality traits align with attributes commonly found in computer science students. Additionally, we can use Bayesian reasoning if prior probability data and likelihoods are available. However, in the absence of specific data, we shall perform a qualitative analysis based on Adam's personality traits relative to general trends in computer science students.

**Traits Analysis with Respect to Computer Science:**
1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants:** This is not strongly associated with computer science but does not conflict.
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles:** Strongly aligns with typical computer science student profiles.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals:** These traits are neutral or slightly less emphasized in typical computer science profiles.
4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts:** Highly aligns with computer science.
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication:** Commonly found in computer science students.

Given this, we will make a qualitative estimation for the posterior probability:

{
  "computer science": 0.75
}

This value reflects the strong alignment of Adam’s problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts with the typical traits of computer science students, despite some of his traits being more neutral or slightly less aligned.
