To compute a posterior conditional probability, we generally use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability of event A occurring given that B is true.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of event B occurring given that A is true.
- \(P(A)\) is the initial probability of event A.
- \(P(B)\) is the initial probability of event B.

However, without precise statistics for the probabilities necessary, we instead use a reasoned estimation based on the given personality sketch.

Adam's profile includes the following traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted with strong empathy and love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Considering these traits:
1. Curiosity about nature and plants might not align perfectly with computer science but can be tangential in fields like bioinformatics.
2. Enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns well with computer science, which often involves problem-solving.
3. High intelligence and abstract thinking ability align well with the technical and theoretical work in computer science.
4. Empathy and love for animals, while not directly related, don't exclude him from working in computer science.

Taking these into account, let's estimate the probability:

{
  "computer science": 0.4 
}

This value reflects that while Adam has traits fitting for computer science, his strong inclination towards nature and empathy suggests he might equally well suit other fields like biology, environmental sciences, psychology, or related interdisciplinary areas.
