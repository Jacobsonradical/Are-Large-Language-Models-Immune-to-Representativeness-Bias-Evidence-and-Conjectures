To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider the base rate (prior probability) of computer science enrollments among graduate students, and how well Adam's characteristics align with common traits of computer science students.

Firstly, let's assume the base rate for graduate students in computer science in the U.S. is approximately 15%. This is a rough estimation for illustration purposes.

Now, let's evaluate how well Adam's traits align with common traits of computer science students:

1. **Genuine Curiosity about Nature and Plants**: This is neutral for computer science.
2. **Solving Puzzles**: Highly relevant for computer science as it involves problem-solving skills.
3. **Warm Heart and Empathy**: More common in fields like psychology or social sciences, but not exclusive to them.
4. **Deep Love for Animals**: This is neutral or slightly more relevant to biology or environmental sciences.
5. **High Intelligence and Abstract Thinking**: Highly relevant for computer science.
6. **Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication**: Relevant to all fields but critical in STEM fields, including computer science.

Using Bayes' theorem conceptually:

P(Computer Science | Adam’s Traits) ∝ P(Adam’s Traits | Computer Science) * P(Computer Science)

Given that Adam's traits are a mixed bag for computer science, but notably, the problem-solving, intelligence, and abstract thinking are significant, we can adjust the base rate slightly upwards.

Let's estimate the likelihood based on his traits:
- High overlap: Solving puzzles, high intelligence, abstract thinking (weighted heavily).
- Medium overlap: Hard work and dedication.
- Low overlap: Empathy, love for animals (weighted less).

Adjusting the base rate of 0.15 upwards due to high relevance traits:

P(Computer Science | Adam’s Traits) ~ 0.15 (base rate) * 1.33 (adjustment factor for relevant traits) = 0.20 (rounded)

Therefore:

{
  "computer science": 0.20
