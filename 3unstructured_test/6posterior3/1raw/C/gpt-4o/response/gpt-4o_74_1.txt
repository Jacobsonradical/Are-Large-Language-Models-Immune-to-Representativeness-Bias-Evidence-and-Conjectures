To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would typically use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch across all fields.

Without specific numerical values, we can make an educated estimation based on the given personality sketch and general knowledge:

1. \( P(A) \) (the prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science): Based on general knowledge, computer science is a popular field. Let's assume this to be around 0.2 (20%).
2. \( P(B|A) \) (the probability of the personality traits given a computer science background): Considering the traits described (high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts), these are reasonably aligned with typical skills in computer science. Let's estimate this to be around 0.5 (50%).
3. \( P(B) \) (the total probability of observing the personality traits across all fields): Given the broad applicability of traits like empathy, intelligence, and curiosity, let's assume this to be around 0.3 (30%).

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1}{0.3} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]

So the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately:

{
  "computer science": 0.33
