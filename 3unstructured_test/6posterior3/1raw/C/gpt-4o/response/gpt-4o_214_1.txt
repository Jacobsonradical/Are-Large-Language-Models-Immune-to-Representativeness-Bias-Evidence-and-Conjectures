To calculate the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we would ideally use Bayes' Theorem. This requires knowing the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in computer science and other fields, as well as the likelihood of his personality traits given each field. However, with the information provided, we can make a reasoned estimate based on the described personality traits and the compatibility of these traits with computer science.

Given that Adam:
- Is a graduate student,
- Has high intelligence,
- Enjoys solving puzzles,
- Understands abstract concepts,
- Has a genuine curiosity about nature (which might also be aligned with computer science applications like bioinformatics or environmental simulations),

These traits are commonly found in students of computer science, as the field often involves solving complex problems and working with abstract concepts. Including Adam's empathy and love for animals might align him more with fields like biology or environmental science, but his puzzle-solving and abstract reasoning skills strongly suggest compatibility with computer science.

Given these considerations, the posterior conditional probability might look as follows:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

This is a reasoned estimate based on the information provided. Itâ€™s important to note that the exact posterior conditional probability would require more specific data for a precise calculation.
