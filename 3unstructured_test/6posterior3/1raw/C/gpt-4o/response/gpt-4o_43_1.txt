To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, Bayesian principles require us to consider how well his characteristics align with typical traits of students in this field, as well as the base rate of students in this field.

Given the provided personality sketch and traits, we need to estimate how likely it is that a person with such characteristics would choose computer science:
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are strong factors aligning well with computer science.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: This is another trait commonly associated with computer science students.
- A quiet demeanor doesn't provide much direct evidence but isn't incompatible with the field.
- Strong empathy, warm heart, and love for animals: These traits are less directly related but don't necessarily exclude the possibility.
- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants: This might be more commonly associated with fields like biology or environmental science, although curiosity in general is beneficial in any academic pursuit.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Universally beneficial and relevant, though more neutral across disciplines.

Considering the alignment between his traits and those generally seen in computer science, and recognizing that there are fields where other aspects of his personality might fit even better, I would compute a moderate probability.

As an estimation:

{
  "computer science": 0.4
}

This value reflects a reasonable likelihood but acknowledges that other fields could also be strongly relevant given his personality.
