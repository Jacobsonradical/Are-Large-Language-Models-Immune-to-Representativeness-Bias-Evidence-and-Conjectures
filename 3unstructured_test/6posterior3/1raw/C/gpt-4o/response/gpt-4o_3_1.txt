To compute the posterior conditional probability, we would typically apply Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific prior probabilities or more quantitative data regarding how personality traits correlate with certain fields of study, providing an exact numerical value would be speculative. Instead, we can conduct a qualitative assessment to guide our estimation.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- He has a strong curiosity about nature and plants.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- Has empathy and a love for animals.
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
- Appreciates hard work and dedication.

Considering these traits, fields strongly associated with nature, plants, and animals (e.g., biology, environmental science) would seem more relevant. However, computer science also involves solving puzzles and abstract concepts.

Given this, I would estimate the posterior conditional probability of Adam being in computer science field to be relatively moderate, but less than those directly involving his interests in nature and animals.

Here's a qualitative estimation:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

This value reflects a moderate likelihood, acknowledging his interest in solving puzzles and abstract concepts, but considering his stronger inclination towards nature and animals which may lead him towards other fields.
