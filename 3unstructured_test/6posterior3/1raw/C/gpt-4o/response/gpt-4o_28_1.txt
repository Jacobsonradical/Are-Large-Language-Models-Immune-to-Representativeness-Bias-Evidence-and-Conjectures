To compute the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, we would typically use Bayes' Theorem. However, since we do not have prior probabilities or a specific dataset, we can only make a qualitative assessment based on the provided information.

Let's break down Adam's personality traits to infer how likely he is to be enrolled in computer science:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants:** This trait is less directly associated with computer science, as computer science usually doesn't focus on natural elements.
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles:** This is a strong indicator for computer science since many computer scientists are known for being introverted and enjoying problem-solving.
3. **Warm heart and strong empathy:** While empathy is valuable in any field, it is not a primary characteristic for computer science.
4. **Love for animals:** This trait doesn't strongly correlate with computer science but doesn't preclude it either.
5. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts:** This is a strong indicator, as these are essential skills in computer science.
6. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** This trait is applicable to many fields, including computer science.

Considering these points qualitatively:
- Positives for computer science: Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts.
- Negatives or neutral: Curiosity about nature and plants, warm heart and empathy, love for animals.

Given this qualitative assessment and considering that the most significant indicators (problem-solving ability, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts) align well with computer science, we might estimate a reasonably high probability.

However, this is a subjective estimation due to the lack of prior probabilities and comprehensive data. Based on the analysis, I'll provide an intuitively reasoned estimation:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```
Note that this value is an educated guess and might vary depending on additional context or data.
