To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. However, without specific data such as prior probabilities (base rates) and likelihoods, we cannot calculate a precise numerical probability. Instead, we can offer a qualitative assessment based on the description provided.

Adam's personality traits include:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's consider how these traits align with a field like computer science:

1. **Solving puzzles**: This aligns well with computer science, as programming and algorithm development require problem-solving skills.
2. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: These traits are highly valued in computer science, where abstract thinking is crucial.
3. **Curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals**: These traits might align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or zoology.
4. **Warm heart and strong empathy**: While these traits are valuable universally, they are not specifically indicative of computer science.
5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Relevant to any field, including computer science.

Given that:
- Some traits strongly align with computer science (e.g., problem-solving abilities, abstract thinking)
- Other traits may align with different fields

Without more specific base rates or likelihoods, our qualitative assessment suggests a moderate probability that Adam could be enrolled in computer science but not at the highest end due to his pronounced interest in nature and empathy, which might align with other fields.

Based on this qualitative assessment, let's estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.5"
