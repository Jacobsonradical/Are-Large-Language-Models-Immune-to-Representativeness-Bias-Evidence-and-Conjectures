To calculate the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(Computer \ Science | Personality \ Sketch) = \frac{P(Personality \ Sketch | Computer \ Science) \times P(Computer \ Science)}{P(Personality \ Sketch)} \]

First, let's break down the needed probabilities:

1. **P(Personality Sketch | Computer Science)**: This is the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is a computer science student.
2. **P(Computer Science)**: This is the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
3. **P(Personality Sketch)**: This is the overall probability of Adam having his specific personality sketch.

Assuming that detailed empirical data isn't available, we will estimate these probabilities based on qualitative reasoning, given the personality traits listed in the sketch.

- **Adam's traits**: high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles, strong empathy, warm heart, love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Likelihood: P(Personality Sketch | Computer Science)
Given that many computer science students possess high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, this supports the compatibility. However, traits like strong empathy, a love for animals, and a genuine curiosity about nature and plants might be less common, though certainly not incompatible. 

Let's assign an estimated probability:
\[ P(Personality Sketch | Computer Science) \approx 0.6 \]

### Prior Probability: P(Computer Science)
For graduate students in the U.S., computer science is a significant but not overly dominant field. Letâ€™s assume:
\[ P(Computer Science) \approx 0.15 \]

### Overall Probability: P(Personality Sketch)
Considering the combination of all listed traits, this exact profile might be somewhat uncommon in any specific field. The probability of randomly having this specific personality sketch might be lower, assuming equal distribution across all areas:

\[ P(Personality Sketch) \approx 0.1 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate:

\[ 
P(Computer \ Science | Personality \ Sketch) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.15}{0.1} = 0.9 
\]
