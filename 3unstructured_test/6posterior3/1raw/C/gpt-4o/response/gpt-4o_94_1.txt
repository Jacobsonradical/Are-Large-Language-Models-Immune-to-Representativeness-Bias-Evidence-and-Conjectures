To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider several factors:

1. Traits and Interests: Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, solving puzzles, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts.
2. Field Alignment: How well these traits and interests align with what is typically required or beneficial in the field of computer science.

Given the information provided:
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts. These traits are generally beneficial for a field like computer science, which involves problem-solving and abstract thinking.
- However, Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals might indicate a stronger inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, or ecology.

To estimate the posterior conditional probability, we can make some qualitative assessments:

- If we assume equal prior probabilities for all possible fields, we might slightly favor fields directly related to his interests in nature and animals over computer science.
- However, given the match between his abstract thinking, problem-solving skills, and empathy with the logic and problem-solving requirements of computer science, we cannot rule it out completely.

Based on this evaluation, I'll provide a reasonable estimate of the posterior probability.

This value reflects the idea that while computer science is a plausible field given Adam's skills, his specific interests might also significantly incline him towards other fields more directly related to nature and animals.
