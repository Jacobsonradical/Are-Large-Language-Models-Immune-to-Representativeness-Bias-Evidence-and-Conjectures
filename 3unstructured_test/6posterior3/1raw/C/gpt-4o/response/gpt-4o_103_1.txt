To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits and interests align with typical traits of students in computer science.

Here's a breakdown of his interests and personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- Quiet persona with an inclination for solving puzzles.
- Warm heart with strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
- High intelligence with an ability to understand abstract concepts.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Now, let's evaluate how these traits can align with computer science:
1. **Puzzle Solving**: Highly relevant, as problem-solving skills are critical in computer science.
2. **High Intelligence and Abstract Concepts**: Very relevant, since understanding abstract theories and concepts is crucial in computer science.
3. **Curiosity**: Relevant, though curiosity about nature is less directly related to traditional computer science.
4. **Quiet and Introspective**: Moderately relevant, as many computer science students may have introverted tendencies that allow them to focus on coding and complex tasks.
5. **Empathy and Love for Animals**: Less relevant, but not exclusive to the field.

We consider these factors to infer how likely it is for Adam to be in computer science. Given that two of his strong traits (puzzle-solving and understanding abstract concepts) align well with typical traits seen in computer science students, we can assert a moderate probability.

Thus, the computed posterior conditional probability for "computer science" given the personality sketch is:
