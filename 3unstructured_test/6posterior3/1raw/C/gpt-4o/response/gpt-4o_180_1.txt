This estimate is based on the consideration that Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, traits that are beneficial for someone in computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature could also lead him to other fields like biology or environmental science. The quantification of this probability is hypothetical and should be taken as an informed guess rather than a precise measurement.
