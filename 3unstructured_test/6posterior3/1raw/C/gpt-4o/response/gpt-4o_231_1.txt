To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to make use of Bayesian inference. The formula for this is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch regardless of the field.

Without concrete data, we have to make educated assumptions regarding these probabilities based on typical trends and Adam's attributes.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probability \(P(A)\):** 
    - Assume that the probability of a random graduate student being in computer science is moderately high, given the popularity and demand for the field.
    Let's assume \( P(A) = 0.3 \) (30%).

2. **Likelihood \(P(B|A):**
    - Adam's skills (high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work) align well with computer science.
    - The interest in puzzles and problem-solving is characteristic of individuals in computer science.
    - His empathy and love for nature are less directly related but don't exclude the field.
    Let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.6 \) (60%).

3. **Marginal Probability \(P(B):**
    - This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch. We can estimate this by considering that Adam's characteristics like high intelligence and empathy are somewhat common, but the combined profile is more unique. For estimation:
    Let's assume \( P(B) = 0.2 \) (20%).

### Calculation:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{0.2} = \frac{0.18}{0.2} = 0.9 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.9.
