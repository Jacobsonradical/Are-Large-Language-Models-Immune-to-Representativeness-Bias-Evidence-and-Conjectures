Given the personality sketch of Adam, we need to assess the fit of his characteristics to the field of computer science, and subsequently, compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.

Personality Traits and Relevance to Computer Science:
1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants**: This trait generally does not directly align with the typical interests of computer scientists, who are more focused on computational and algorithmic problems. However, interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics or environmental modeling could align with this interest.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This trait is highly relevant to computer science. Many aspects of computer science, such as coding, debugging, algorithm design, and problem-solving, are akin to solving puzzles.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals**: These traits do not directly correspond to the typical profile of a computer science student, though they do not preclude someone from being in the field. They might suggest better fit with fields involving direct interaction with living beings unless we're considering humane tech or AI ethics.
4. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: High relevance to computer science, which often requires abstract thinking, mathematical proficiency, and conceptual understanding.
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This trait is broadly applicable across many fields, including computer science, where persistence and dedication are crucial for success.

Considering these factors, there's a moderate to high probability that a graduate student with these traits might be in the field of computer science, particularly given strengths in intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract concepts.

However, curiosity about nature and empathetic traits could equally lead Adam to other fields, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology.

Given these considerations, we estimate the posterior conditional probability as:

  "computer science": 0.6
