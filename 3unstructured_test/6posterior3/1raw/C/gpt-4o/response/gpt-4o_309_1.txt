**Explanation:**
Given Adam's traits, one might think he is more inclined toward life sciences or environmental studies due to his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals. However, his high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles could also make him a good fit for computer science. Therefore, while not the most likely discipline given the presence of other traits that align more closely with life and environmental sciences, there is a substantial chance that Adam could be in computer science, reflecting a reasonably balanced consideration of his traits.
