To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider the alignment of his traits with the field of computer science. 

Key traits we can consider:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
4. Strong empathy and love for animals.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

For computer science:
- Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant.
- High intelligence is a good fit.
- A genuine curiosity, love for nature and animals, and strong empathy are less immediately relevant to computer science compared to fields like biology or environmental science.

Without specific numeric data, but based on these qualitative assessments, the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science can be roughly estimated as moderately likely based on his analytical skills but somewhat moderated by his strong inclination towards nature and empathy.

Given these considerations, a rough estimate of the probability could be around 0.4.
