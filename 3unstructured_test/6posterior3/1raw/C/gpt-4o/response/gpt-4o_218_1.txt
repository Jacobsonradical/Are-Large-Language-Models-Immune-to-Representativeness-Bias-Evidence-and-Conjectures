To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, let's consider the traits described:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
2. Enjoyment in solving puzzles
3. Warm heart and strong empathy
4. Deep love for animals
5. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
6. Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

Given this information, we need to assess how well these traits align with the field of computer science and use Bayesian reasoning (qualitatively in this case due to lack of precise data).

Traits such as high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are aligned with computer science. Enjoyment in solving puzzles is also a strong indicator for someone in computer science. However, a deep love for nature, plants, and animals does not particularly point to computer science but isn't necessarily misaligned either.

Given these factors, we could reasonably estimate a moderate probability that Adam could have been in the computer science field due to traits 2, 5, and 6 strongly matching while the others are neutral rather than contradictory.

Thus, the posterior conditional probability might look something like:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This value is an estimate based on qualitative reasoning and importance alignment of personality traits with the field.
