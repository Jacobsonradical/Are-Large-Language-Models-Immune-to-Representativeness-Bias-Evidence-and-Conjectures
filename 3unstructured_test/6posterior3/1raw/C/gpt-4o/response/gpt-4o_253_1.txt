To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. However, computing this accurately would require prior probabilities and likelihoods, which are not provided in the question. 

Given Adam's personality traits such as high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, curiosity about nature, and solving puzzles, there's a reasonable association with skills valuable in computer science. However, deep love for animals and biology may also suggest fields like biology or environmental science.

Given these considerations, here is a reasonable estimation, balancing these factors:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

This estimation suggests that there is a moderate chance Adam could be in computer science based on the provided personality sketch.
