To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch, we must consider both the prior probability of a graduate student enrolling in computer science and how well his personality and interests fit that field.

Let's summarize the key aspects of Adam's personality:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm-hearted with strong empathy.
4. Deep love for animals.
5. High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
6. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

The field of computer science often attracts individuals who are good at solving puzzles, have high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciate hard work and dedication. However, Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature might make him more likely to enroll in fields more closely related to biology, environmental science, or animal studies. 

Given these considerations, letâ€™s assume that the prior probability (assumed frequency of graduate students enrolling in computer science) is around 0.25 (as computer science is a popular field).

The fit of Adam's specific traits (puzzle-solving, appreciation for hard work, and abstract thinking) to computer science is moderate, but not extremely strong due to his strong affinity for nature and animals. 

Let's estimate the posterior probability:
