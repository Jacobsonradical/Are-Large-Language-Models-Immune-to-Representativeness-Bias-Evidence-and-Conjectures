To compute the posterior conditional probability, we will use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

However, without concrete numerical values for these probabilities, we should rely on a qualitative assessment.

**Given Adam's personality sketch:**
- Adam has a strong curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a deep love for animals and strong empathy.
- He is of high intelligence and understands abstract concepts well.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

**Relating this to fields of study:**
- Computer Science (CS) typically involves a lot of problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, which aligns with Adam's high intelligence and love for puzzles.
- However, his love for nature, plants, and animals might make fields like biology or environmental science a better match.
- Empathy and a warm heart could align with education, psychology, or other social sciences.
- His appreciation for hard work and dedication is somewhat neutral but is beneficial in any field.

Given these points, while Computer Science is plausible due to his analytical skills, other fields might be more aligned with his naturalistic interests and empathy towards animals.

With this qualitative reasoning, here's an estimated probability for Computer Science:

- Assuming rudimentary priors and likelihoods, let's estimate \( P(B | A) \) as moderate, \( P(A) \) as an average field enrollment likelihood, and adjusting \( P(B)\) considering the perceived overall fit of his personality sketch across potential fields, a rough approximation would be at or below the average likelihood.

This value is an illustrative estimate based on the qualitative analysis provided. For a precise probability, detailed statistical data on field enrollments and personality fits would be required.
