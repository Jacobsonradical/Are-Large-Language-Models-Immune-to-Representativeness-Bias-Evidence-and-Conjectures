{
  "computer science": 0.2
}

Here is an explanation for the estimation: 

Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the requirements of computer science. Additionally, problem-solving skills and a curiosity for understanding complex systems can also point towards a field in computer science. However, Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature and hard work might be more suggestive of fields such as biology, environmental science, or some other related area. Therefore, while it's plausible that he might be in computer science, his personality sketch doesn't make it overwhelmingly likely. Hence, a probability of 0.2 seems to fairly represent this balance.
