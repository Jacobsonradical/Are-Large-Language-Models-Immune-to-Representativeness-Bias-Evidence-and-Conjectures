Given Adam's personality sketch and background, we can make an educated guess about the posterior conditional probability that he was enrolled in computer science. It is essential to consider that Adam demonstrates an interest in nature and animals, is good at solving puzzles, and has high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and abstract concepts.

However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature might indicate a higher likelihood for fields closely related to biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than computer science. Nevertheless, the skills and traits such as being good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts can be correlated with a propensity for computer science as well.

Taking into account these factors, I would surmise the probability as follows:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

This value reflects that while there is a possibility that Adam might be in the computer science field due to his problem-solving abilities and abstract thinking, his interests in nature and animals might suggest a slightly lower probability for this field compared to more directly related disciplines.
