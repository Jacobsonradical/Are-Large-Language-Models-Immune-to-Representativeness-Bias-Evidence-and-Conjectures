To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Unfortunately, without specific prior probabilities or a likelihood function that specifically applies to graduate students in various fields, any value assigned would be purely speculative. 

Given Adam's personality traits—curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and enjoyment of solving puzzles—fields such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology might seem more likely intuitively. However, let's consider the necessary computations hypothetically:

Assume:
- Prior probability \( P(CS) \) is the general proportion of graduate students in computer science.
- P(A|CS) is the probability of observing the personality traits given Adam is in computer science.
- P(A) is the overall probability of observing the personality traits.

In absence of specific data:
1. **P(CS)** might be assumed to be 0.2 (Let's say typically 20% of graduate students are in computer science).
2. **P(A|CS)** would be estimated lower than some other fields but non-zero due to his intelligence and puzzle-solving which might relate well to computer science (let's assume 0.3).
3. **P(A)** would then be the total probability of observing the traits, which would incorporate all fields and their respective trait likelihoods (assumed for simplification to be stabilizing the model, say 0.25).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|A) = \frac{P(A|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(A)} \]

\[ P(CS|A) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.25} = \frac{0.06}{0.25} = 0.24 \]

Here is the answer in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": 0.24
}
```

Please note: The figure is illustrative and assumptions-driven. Access to specific data and real-world probabilities would refine this estimation significantly.
