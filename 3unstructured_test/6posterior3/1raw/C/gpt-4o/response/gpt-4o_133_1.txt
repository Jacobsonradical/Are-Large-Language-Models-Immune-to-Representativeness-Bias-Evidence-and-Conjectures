To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how well his traits match the common characteristics of students typically enrolled in that field. 

Let's evaluate this qualitatively:

1. **High Intelligence**: Fits well with computer science.
2. **Good at understanding abstract concepts**: Strongly matches with computer science.
3. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Also a good match since problem-solving is a key aspect of computer science.
4. **Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants**: This trait is more closely aligned with fields like biology or environmental science.
5. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals**: These traits are generally more connected to fields like veterinary science, medicine, or psychology than computer science.
6. **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This is a versatile trait that can match with computer science but is not exclusive to it.

Considering these factors, while Adam has characteristics that align with computer science, some of his traits also strongly lean towards fields in natural sciences or social sciences:

  "computer science": "0.4"

This value reflects that while Adam certainly possesses qualities that could make him successful in computer science, there are significant other interests and traits that suggest he could equally likely be enrolled in other fields.
