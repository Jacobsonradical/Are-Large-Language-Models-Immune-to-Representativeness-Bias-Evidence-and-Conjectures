To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(ComputerScience | PersonalitySketch) = \frac{P(PersonalitySketch | ComputerScience) \cdot P(ComputerScience)}{P(PersonalitySketch)} \]

However, we don't have the explicit values for these probabilities. Therefore, we will have to make reasoned estimations based on Adam's personality traits and common characteristics of computer science students. 

1. **P(PersonalitySketch | ComputerScience)**: This is the likelihood that someone in computer science has Adam's personality traits.
   - Computer science students often:
     - Have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles.
     - Understand abstract concepts.
     - May or may not have a love for nature and animals (this isn't a frequent characteristic mentioned for computer science specifically, but it doesn't rule it out).

Given Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, it's reasonable to say that P(PersonalitySketch | ComputerScience) is relatively high but not extremely so because of the less common traits like love for nature and animals.

2. **P(ComputerScience)**: This is the prior probability that a randomly selected graduate student is in computer science.
   - As of recent years, computer science is a highly popular field among graduate students.
   - Let's assume a rough prior estimate that about 1 in 5 graduate students is in computer science. So, P(ComputerScience) ≈ 0.2.

3. **P(PersonalitySketch)**: This is the overall probability of encountering Adam's specific personality sketch in the graduate student population.
   - It's harder to estimate directly but let's consider Adam's blend of traits: intellectual curiosity, puzzle-solving enjoyment, empathy, love for nature and animals.
   - Such a set of combined traits might not be extremely common, but they aren't extremely rare either.

Given the context and the balance of traits, let’s make an estimation:

\[ P(ComputerScience | PersonalitySketch) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} \]

Where:
- \( P(PersonalitySketch | ComputerScience) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(ComputerScience) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(PersonalitySketch) \approx 0.4 \) (Since the traits are moderately common among a wide variety of fields)

Calculating this:

\[ P(ComputerScience | PersonalitySketch) \approx \frac{0.14}{0.4} = 0.35 \]

So the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.35.

Therefore, the response in the desired format is:

{
  "computer science": "0.35"
