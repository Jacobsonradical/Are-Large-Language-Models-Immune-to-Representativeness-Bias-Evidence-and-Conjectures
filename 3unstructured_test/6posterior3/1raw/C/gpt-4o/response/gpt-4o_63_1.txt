To compute the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch, we need to consider how Adam's personality aligns with characteristics typically associated with computer science students.

Let's analyze the traits:

1. **Curiosity about nature and plants**: This trait is not particularly indicative of computer science but also isn't exclusive of it.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This aligns well with the problem-solving nature of computer science.
3. **Quiet**: While personality types can vary, quiet individuals often thrive in fields like computer science where focus and concentration are beneficial.
4. **Warm heart and empathy**: These traits may not be specifically related to computer science.
5. **Love for animals**: This doesn't provide a clear indication for computer science.
6. **High intelligence**: Field-agnostic but necessary for success in demanding fields like computer science.
7. **Understanding abstract concepts**: Very relevant to computer science.
8. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Important for any challenging field, including computer science.

Given these considerations, let's assign weights to how these traits could align with computer science. We'll proceed qualitatively, as precise quantitative data is not available.

Key traits with strong alignment (puzzles, abstract concepts, intelligence, and hard work):

Let's assign a posterior probability value based on these qualitative factors:

{
  "computer science": 0.65
}

This value suggests that, while not certain, there's a significant likelihood that Adam could be enrolled in computer science given his personality traits aligned with some key aspects of the field.
