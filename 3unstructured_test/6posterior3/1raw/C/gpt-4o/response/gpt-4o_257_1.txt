Calculating the exact posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on his personality sketch requires detailed prior probabilities and a comprehensive analysis, which typically involves Bayesian statistics. However, I can provide a reasoned estimate.

Adam's genuine curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with characteristics beneficial in computer science. Nonetheless, his love for nature, empathy, and interest in animals might suggest fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary sciences could also be well-suited.

Given these considerations, I'll assign a reasonable Bayesian-inspired estimate.
