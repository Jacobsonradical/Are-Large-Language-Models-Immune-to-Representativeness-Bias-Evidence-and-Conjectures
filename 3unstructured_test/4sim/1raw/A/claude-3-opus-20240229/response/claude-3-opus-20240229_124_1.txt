Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts also align well with this field of study.
