  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, and his strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His other traits like intelligence, empathy, and problem-solving skills would also serve him well in this field. The one aspect not strongly indicated is hands-on experience with animals or agriculture, but his interests and personal qualities still give him a strong alignment overall.
