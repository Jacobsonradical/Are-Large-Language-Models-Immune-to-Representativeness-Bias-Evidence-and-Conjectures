  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong interest in nature, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor and abstract thinking skills also seem compatible with this field of study. The only potential difference is the emphasis on solving puzzles, which may be less directly relevant. Overall, I estimate a similarity of 0.8 on a 0 to 1 scale.
