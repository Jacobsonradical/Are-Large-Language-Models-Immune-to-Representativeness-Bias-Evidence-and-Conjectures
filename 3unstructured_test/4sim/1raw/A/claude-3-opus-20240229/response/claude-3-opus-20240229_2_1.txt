Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and strong work ethic suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet nature and abstract thinking may be somewhat less typical but overall the personality sketch paints a picture of someone well-suited for graduate studies in this field.
