Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in the agricultural and veterinary sciences. His quiet demeanor and abstract thinking skills also seem well-suited for academic pursuits in this field. The main uncertainty is whether he has the specific scientific background and hands-on experience that would be expected. But his overall profile seems like a strong fit.
