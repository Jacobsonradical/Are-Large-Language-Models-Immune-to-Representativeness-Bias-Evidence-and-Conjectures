Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, and his strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, abstract thinking skills, and high intelligence would also serve him well in this field. The main missing piece of information is his specific academic background and research interests.
