Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts also seem well-suited for graduate-level study and research in this field. The main traits that seem less typical are his strong empathy and enjoyment of solving puzzles, but overall his profile aligns well with this field of study.
