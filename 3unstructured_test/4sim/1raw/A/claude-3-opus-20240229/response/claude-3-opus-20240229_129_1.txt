Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication all seem very well aligned with a typical graduate student pursuing agricultural or veterinary science. The main traits that seem less typical are being quiet and good at abstract concepts, as agricultural and veterinary science can involve a lot of hands-on work and interaction. But overall, I believe there is a strong similarity based on the description provided.
