Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the provided personality sketch:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve him well in this field. The only potential difference is that agricultural and veterinary science can involve a lot of hands-on work in addition to abstract problem-solving, and it's unclear if Adam has an affinity for that. But overall, I believe there is a strong similarity.
