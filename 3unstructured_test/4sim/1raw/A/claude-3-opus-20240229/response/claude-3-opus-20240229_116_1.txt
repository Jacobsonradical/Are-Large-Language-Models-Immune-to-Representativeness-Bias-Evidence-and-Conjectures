  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in the agricultural and veterinary sciences. His quiet demeanor and interest in abstract concepts also seem compatible with academic research in these fields. The one potential difference is his strong empathy, as some scientific research may require an emotional detachment, but overall he seems to align well with this field of study based on his profile.
