{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in the agricultural and veterinary sciences. His quiet demeanor and interest in abstract concepts also seem compatible with academic research in this field. The main uncertainty is whether his interest in puzzles and problem-solving is as directly relevant. Overall, I estimate a relatively high similarity of 0.8 on a 0 to 1 scale.
