Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and strong work ethic suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student pursuing agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor and abstract thinking skills also seem well-suited for research in this field. The main uncertainty is whether his specific interests and knowledge are a strong match, but overall the personality sketch indicates a high degree of similarity.
