Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the given personality sketch:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor and interest in puzzles and abstract concepts also seem compatible with this field of study. The only potential difference is that hands-on agricultural work can sometimes be less abstract, but overall he seems to have aptitudes and interests well-aligned with this field.
