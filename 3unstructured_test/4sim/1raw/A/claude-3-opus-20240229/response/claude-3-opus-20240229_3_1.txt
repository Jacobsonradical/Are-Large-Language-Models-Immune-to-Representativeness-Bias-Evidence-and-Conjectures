  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong interest in nature, deep love for animals, and high intelligence suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also qualities that would align well with this field of study. However, without more specific information about his academic background and research interests, I cannot say with certainty that he would be an exact match, so I provide a score of 0.8 out of 1.
