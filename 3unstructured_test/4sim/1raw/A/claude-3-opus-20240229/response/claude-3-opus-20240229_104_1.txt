Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation of hard work and dedication all suggest Adam would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural or veterinary science. However, without more details on his specific interests and skills, I cannot say he would be a perfect match, so I give a similarity score of 0.8 out of 1.
