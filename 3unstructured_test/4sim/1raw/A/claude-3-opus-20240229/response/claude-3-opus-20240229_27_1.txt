Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, and his strong appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student pursuing agricultural or veterinary science. His quiet nature, empathy, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts also seem well-suited for graduate-level study and research in these fields.
