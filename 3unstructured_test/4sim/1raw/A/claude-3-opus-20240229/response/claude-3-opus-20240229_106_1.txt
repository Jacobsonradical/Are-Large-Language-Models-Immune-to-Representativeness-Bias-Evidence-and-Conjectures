Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and strong work ethic suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural or veterinary science. His quiet nature and abstract thinking skills also seem well-suited for graduate-level scientific study and research in these fields focused on nature, plants, and animals.
