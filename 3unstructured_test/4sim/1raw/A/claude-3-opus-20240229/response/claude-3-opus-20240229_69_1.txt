Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in the given field, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"

Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals along with his empathy and intelligence suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His personality traits align well with someone who would dedicate themselves to studying and caring for plants and animals through a scientific lens.
