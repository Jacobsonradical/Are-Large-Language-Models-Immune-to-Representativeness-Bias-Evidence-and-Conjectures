  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals. His empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest he would likely be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his academic background and research interests, I cannot say with certainty that he is maximally similar, so I give a score of 0.8 out of 1.
