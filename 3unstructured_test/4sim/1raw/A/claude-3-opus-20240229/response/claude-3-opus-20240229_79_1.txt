Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in the given field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about plants and nature, and strong empathy suggest he would likely be quite similar to a typical graduate student pursuing agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also serve him well in this field. However, without more specifics on his academic background and research interests, I cannot say he would be an exact match, so I give a similarity score of 0.8.
