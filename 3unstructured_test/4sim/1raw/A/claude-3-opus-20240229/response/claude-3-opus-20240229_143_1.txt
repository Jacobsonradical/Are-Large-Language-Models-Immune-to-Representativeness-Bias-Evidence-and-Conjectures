Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, and his strong appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet nature, abstract thinking skills, and high intelligence are also qualities that could serve him well in this field of study. The one aspect that is less clear is his skill at solving puzzles, but overall his profile seems like a strong match for this field.
