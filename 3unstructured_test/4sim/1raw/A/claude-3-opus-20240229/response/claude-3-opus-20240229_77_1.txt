Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor and enjoyment of solving puzzles also seem compatible with this field of study. The main traits that may be less typical are his strong empathy and ability to understand abstract concepts, but overall he seems to have many qualities well-suited for graduate studies related to agriculture, animals and veterinary science.
