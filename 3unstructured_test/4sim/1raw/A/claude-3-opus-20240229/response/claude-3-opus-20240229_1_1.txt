Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the given personality sketch:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, combined with his deep love for animals and strong empathy, suggests he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve him well in this field. The main uncertainty is whether he has a specific interest in agriculture or veterinary medicine, as opposed to other fields relating to nature and animals.
