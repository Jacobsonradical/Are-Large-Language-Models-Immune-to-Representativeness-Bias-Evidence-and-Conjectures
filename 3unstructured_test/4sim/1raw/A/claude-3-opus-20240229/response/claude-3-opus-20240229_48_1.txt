Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in the fields of agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor and enjoyment of solving puzzles also seem well-suited for research in these areas. The main missing piece of information is his specific academic background and research interests.
