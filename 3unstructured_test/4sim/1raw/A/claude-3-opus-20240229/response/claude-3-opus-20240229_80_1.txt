Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and strong work ethic suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student studying agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor and abstract thinking abilities also seem compatible with graduate-level scientific study and research in this field. The one aspect that may be less typical is his enjoyment of puzzles, but overall he seems to have a personality and interests well-aligned with this area of study.
