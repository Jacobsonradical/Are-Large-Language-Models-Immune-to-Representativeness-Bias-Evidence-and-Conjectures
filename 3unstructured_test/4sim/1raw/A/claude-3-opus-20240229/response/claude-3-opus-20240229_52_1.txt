Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in the given field, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve him well in this field. The only potential difference is that he is described as a quiet person, whereas some agricultural and veterinary science work can involve interacting with and educating others. However, overall, there seems to be a strong alignment between his interests and qualities and this field of study.
