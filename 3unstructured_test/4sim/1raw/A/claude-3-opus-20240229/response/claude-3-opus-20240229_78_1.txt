Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the provided personality sketch:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"

The key traits that suggest Adam would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in this field include his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, his high intelligence, and his strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. Graduate study in agricultural and veterinary science would align well with these interests and strengths. The main traits that seem less relevant are his enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts, though these certainly wouldn't be incompatible with the field.
