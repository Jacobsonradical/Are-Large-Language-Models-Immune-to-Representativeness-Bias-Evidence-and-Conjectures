Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"

The key traits that suggest Adam would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in this field are his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, his strong empathy, and his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts. These qualities align well with someone who would be drawn to and succeed in agricultural and veterinary science.
