{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet nature and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit well with this field. The main traits that may be less typical are his strong empathy and enjoyment of puzzles, but overall the alignment seems quite high, so I've rated the similarity as 0.8 on a 0 to 1 scale.
