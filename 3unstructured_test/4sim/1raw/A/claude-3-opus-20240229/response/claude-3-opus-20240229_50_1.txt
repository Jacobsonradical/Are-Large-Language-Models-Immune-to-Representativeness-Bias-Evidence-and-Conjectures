Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all seem very well aligned with a graduate student pursuing studies in agricultural and veterinary science. The main trait that seems less directly relevant is enjoying solving puzzles, but that could still be an asset in many areas of scientific research. Overall, I believe there is a strong similarity based on the description provided.
