Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, combined with his deep love for animals and strong empathy, make him a good fit for graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are also valuable traits in this field. However, the personality sketch does not specifically mention hands-on experience or a background in agriculture or animal care, which is why I did not give a score of 1.0.
