Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, and his strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student studying agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, abstract thinking skills, and high intelligence would also fit well in this field of study. The only potential difference is the mention of enjoying puzzles, which is not necessarily a strong indicator of similarity to agricultural and veterinary science students.
