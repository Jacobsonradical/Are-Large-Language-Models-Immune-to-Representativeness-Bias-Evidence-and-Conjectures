  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet personality and enjoyment of puzzles also seem compatible with the scientific nature of this field. The main uncertainty is whether his abstract thinking style would be as good a fit for the hands-on, practical aspects of agricultural and veterinary work. But overall, I estimate a relatively high similarity of 0.8 on a 0 to 1 scale.
