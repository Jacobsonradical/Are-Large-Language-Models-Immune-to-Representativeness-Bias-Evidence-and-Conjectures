  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"

Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor and interest in puzzles also seem compatible with the rigorous scientific study required in this field. The one aspect that seems potentially less aligned is the mention of understanding abstract concepts, as agricultural and veterinary science can involve a lot of hands-on, practical work. But overall, Adam's profile suggests a strong fit with this field of study.
