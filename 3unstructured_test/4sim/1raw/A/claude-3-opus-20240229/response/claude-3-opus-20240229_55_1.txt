Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the personality sketch provided:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and strong work ethic suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor and ability to understand abstract concepts also seem well-suited for graduate-level study and research in this field. The main reason I did not give a score of 1.0 is that puzzle-solving ability was not necessarily as relevant, so there are likely some differences. But overall, Adam seems to have a personality and interests that align well with this field of graduate study.
