Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student studying agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve him well in this field. The main area where he may differ somewhat is being described as a "quiet boy", as graduate students in this field likely need to communicate and collaborate actively. But overall, there seems to be a strong alignment between Adam's interests and strengths and what is typical for graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science.
