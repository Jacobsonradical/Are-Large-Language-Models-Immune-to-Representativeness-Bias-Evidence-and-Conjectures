Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit well with this field of study. The main trait that seems less typical is his enjoyment of solving puzzles, but overall his profile aligns well with someone who would pursue graduate studies related to agriculture, animals and veterinary medicine.
