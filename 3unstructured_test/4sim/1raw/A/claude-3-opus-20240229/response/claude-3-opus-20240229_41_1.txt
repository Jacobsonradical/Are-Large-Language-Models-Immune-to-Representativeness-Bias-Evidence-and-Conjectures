Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has traits and interests well-aligned with agricultural and veterinary science, including a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. Graduate students in this field would typically have many of those same characteristics. The main trait not explicitly mentioned is hands-on experience with animals or agriculture, but the overall profile still seems quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science graduate student.
