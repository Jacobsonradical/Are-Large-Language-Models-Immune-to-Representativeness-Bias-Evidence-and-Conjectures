{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about his academic background and research interests, I cannot say he would be a perfect match, so I provide a similarity score of 0.8 out of 1.
