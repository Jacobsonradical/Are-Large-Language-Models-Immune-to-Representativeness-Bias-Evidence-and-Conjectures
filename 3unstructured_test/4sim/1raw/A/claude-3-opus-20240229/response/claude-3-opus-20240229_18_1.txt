Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor and interest in abstract concepts also seem compatible with academic research in this field. The one trait that seems less typical is his interest in puzzles, but overall his profile aligns well with this field of study.
