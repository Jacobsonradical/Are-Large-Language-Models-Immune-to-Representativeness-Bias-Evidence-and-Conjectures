Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"

Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all seem well-aligned with a graduate student pursuing agricultural or veterinary science. The main traits that seem less relevant are his quiet nature and enjoyment of puzzles, but overall his profile seems quite similar to a typical student in this field.
