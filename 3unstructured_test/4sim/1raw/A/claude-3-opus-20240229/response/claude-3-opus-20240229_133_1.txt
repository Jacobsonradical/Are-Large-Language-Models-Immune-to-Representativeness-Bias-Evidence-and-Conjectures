Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor and interest in abstract concepts also seem compatible with this field of study. The main missing piece of information is any direct experience with agriculture or animal care, but his personality traits point to a good fit overall.
