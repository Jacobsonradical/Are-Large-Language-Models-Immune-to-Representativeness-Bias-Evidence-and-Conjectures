Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student studying agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specifics on his academic background and research interests, I cannot say he would be a perfect match, so I give a similarity score of 0.8.
