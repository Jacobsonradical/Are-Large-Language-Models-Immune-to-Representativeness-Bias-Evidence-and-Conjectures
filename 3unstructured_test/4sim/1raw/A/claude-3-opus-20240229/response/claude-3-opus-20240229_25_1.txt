Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit well with this field of study. The main traits not explicitly mentioned that might be relevant are hands-on skills working with animals and comfort with field work, but overall Adam seems to align quite closely with this field based on his personality profile.
