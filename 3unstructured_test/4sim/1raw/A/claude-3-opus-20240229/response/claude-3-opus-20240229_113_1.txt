{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor and abstract thinking abilities also seem well-suited for academic research in this field. The main uncertainty is whether his strong empathy might be challenging in a field that sometimes requires difficult decisions regarding animal welfare. Overall, I estimate a relatively high similarity of 0.8 on a 0 to 1 scale.
