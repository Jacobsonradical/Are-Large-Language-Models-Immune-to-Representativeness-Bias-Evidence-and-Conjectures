Explanation:
- Computer Science: Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills and interests typical of a computer science graduate student. Hence, a score of 0.7.
- Business Administration: While Adam's high intelligence could be applicable, his personality traits such as being quiet, his deep love for animals, and his strong empathy are not typically associated with the more extroverted and strategically-minded business administration graduate student. Hence, a score of 0.3.
