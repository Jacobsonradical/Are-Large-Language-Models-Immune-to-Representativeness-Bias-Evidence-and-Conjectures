Explanation:
- Computer Science: Adam's curiosity, high intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align well with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student. Additionally, his enjoyment of solving puzzles suggests a strong problem-solving ability, which is crucial in computer science.
- Business Administration: While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be beneficial in business administration, his quiet nature, strong empathy, and deep love for animals and nature do not typically align with the more extroverted, competitive, and corporate-focused environment of a business administration graduate program.
