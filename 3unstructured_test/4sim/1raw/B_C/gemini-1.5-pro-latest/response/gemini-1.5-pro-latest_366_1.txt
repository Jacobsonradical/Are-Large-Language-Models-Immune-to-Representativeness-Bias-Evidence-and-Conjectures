**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business, his core personality traits seem more aligned with scientific or analytical fields. His love for nature, problem-solving, and abstract thinking don't stereotypically match the core focus of a typical business administration student.

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential affinity with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this. While not a perfect match, he aligns more closely with the typical traits associated with computer science graduate students.
