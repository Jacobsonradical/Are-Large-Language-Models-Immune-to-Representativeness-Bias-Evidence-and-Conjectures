**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His love for puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work are all traits commonly found in computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business administration, Adam's other traits (love of nature, empathy, and quiet demeanor) are less central to the field. Business administration often emphasizes interpersonal skills, assertiveness, and a focus on financial gain, which are not directly mentioned in Adam's personality.
