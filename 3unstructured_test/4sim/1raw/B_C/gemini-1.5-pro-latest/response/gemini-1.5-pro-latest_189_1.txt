**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his personality leans more towards intellectual and introspective pursuits.  His love for nature, empathy, and puzzle-solving doesn't strongly align with a typical business administration student.

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential affinity with computer science.  This field often attracts individuals with similar traits.
