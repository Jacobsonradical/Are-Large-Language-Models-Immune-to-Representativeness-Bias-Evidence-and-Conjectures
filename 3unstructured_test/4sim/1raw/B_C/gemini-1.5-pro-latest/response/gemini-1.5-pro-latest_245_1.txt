**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential similarity with computer science graduate students. These traits are highly valued in the field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant to business administration, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of the field. Business administration often involves a stronger focus on interpersonal skills, leadership, and a competitive drive.
