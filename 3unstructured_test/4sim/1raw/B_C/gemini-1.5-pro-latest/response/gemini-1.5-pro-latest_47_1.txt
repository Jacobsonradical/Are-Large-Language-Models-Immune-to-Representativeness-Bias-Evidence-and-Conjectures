Here's an assessment of Adam's personality against the two fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of a mind drawn to computer science. Many in this field share his curiosity and problem-solving drive. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, Adam's deep empathy and love for nature don't align as strongly with the typical business student persona. This isn't to say he *couldn't* succeed, but his profile suggests a stronger affinity for analytical and possibly research-oriented fields.
