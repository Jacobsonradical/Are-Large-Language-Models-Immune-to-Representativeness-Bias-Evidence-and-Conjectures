**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with typical computer science graduate students. His high intelligence is also a strong asset in this field.  However, his love for nature and animals might be less common in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, Adam's personality profile leans more towards empathy and a love for nature, which are not as typical in business administration students. His quiet nature might also be less common.
