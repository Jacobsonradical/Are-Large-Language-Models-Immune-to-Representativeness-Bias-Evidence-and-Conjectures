**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the typical personality of a computer science graduate student. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of business administration students.  

**Note:** This is a speculative assessment based on general personality trends. Individual students in any field can vary widely.
