Here's my assessment of Adam's personality in relation to typical graduate students in the given fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student.  While his nature affinity might be less common in this field, it's not unusual for individuals in technical fields to have diverse interests. 

* **Business Administration:** Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business, but his profile leans more towards analytical and introspective qualities.  While these are not absent in business administration, they are less defining compared to traits like assertiveness, strong communication, and a focus on leadership â€“ aspects not highlighted in Adam's description.
