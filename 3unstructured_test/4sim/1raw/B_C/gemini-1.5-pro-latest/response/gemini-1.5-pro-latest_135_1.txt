Here's an assessment of Adam's personality against typical graduate student profiles in the given fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business, his core personality leans away from the typical MBA profile. His love for nature, empathy, and quiet demeanor might not align as strongly with the more competitive, fast-paced, and often extroverted world of business.

* **Computer Science:**  Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential affinity with computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and have a knack for logic and systems, aligning well with Adam's described traits.
