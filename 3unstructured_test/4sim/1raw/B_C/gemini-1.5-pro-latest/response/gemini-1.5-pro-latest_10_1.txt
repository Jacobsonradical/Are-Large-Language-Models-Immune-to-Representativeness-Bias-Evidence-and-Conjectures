**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant to business administration, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of the field compared to computer science.
