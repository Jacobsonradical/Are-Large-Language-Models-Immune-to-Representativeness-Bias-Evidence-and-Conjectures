**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's personality aligns well with a computer science student. His enjoyment of puzzles translates to problem-solving, a key skill in computer science. His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are also beneficial in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work are valuable traits in any field, they are less central to a typical business administration student than someone in a more technical field like computer science. 

**Important Note:** This is a speculative assessment based on stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field can vary greatly.
