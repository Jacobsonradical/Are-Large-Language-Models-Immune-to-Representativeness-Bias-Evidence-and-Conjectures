**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's personality aligns well with a computer science student. His love for puzzles suggests an affinity for problem-solving, a key skill in computer science.  His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are also strong indicators of potential success in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work are valuable traits in any field, they don't specifically point towards business administration.  His personality seems more focused on intellectual pursuits and less on the competitive, financially driven aspects often associated with business.
