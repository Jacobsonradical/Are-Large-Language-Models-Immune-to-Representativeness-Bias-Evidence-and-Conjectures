Here's my assessment of Adam's potential similarity to graduate students in the given fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication might resonate with some aspects of business administration, his core personality traits seem less aligned.  His love for nature, empathy, and puzzle-solving suggest interests that might not be as centrally emphasized in a typical business administration program.

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential alignment with computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking. His high intelligence further supports this assessment.
