**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a computer science student. His love for puzzles translates to problem-solving, a key skill in computer science.  His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are also valuable in the field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence and work ethic could be beneficial in a business context, his personality seems less aligned with the typical business administration student.  His interests in nature, animals, and empathy don't strongly suggest a business inclination.
