**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business, his personality leans more towards intellectual and empathetic pursuits.  His love for nature and animals might suggest less interest in the corporate world. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential aptitude for computer science. This field often attracts individuals with those strengths.
