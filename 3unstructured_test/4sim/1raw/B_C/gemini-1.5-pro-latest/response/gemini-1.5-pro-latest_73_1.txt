**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, particularly his ability to understand abstract concepts, suggest a strong affinity with computer science. This field often attracts individuals with these traits. 

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work are valuable in business, his personality sketch leans more towards intellectual and introspective pursuits.  Business administration often prioritizes interpersonal skills, leadership qualities, and a drive for tangible results, which are not as prominently featured in Adam's description.
