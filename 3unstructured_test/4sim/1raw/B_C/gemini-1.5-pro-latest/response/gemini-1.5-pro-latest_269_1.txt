**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile emphasizing problem-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence aligns well with typical traits of computer science graduate students. While his love for nature might be less common, it's not unheard of. 
* **Business Administration:**  Adam's empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are valuable traits but less defining for business administration compared to leadership, ambition, and strong networking skills. His profile suggests a more introverted and potentially less competitive nature than the average business student.
