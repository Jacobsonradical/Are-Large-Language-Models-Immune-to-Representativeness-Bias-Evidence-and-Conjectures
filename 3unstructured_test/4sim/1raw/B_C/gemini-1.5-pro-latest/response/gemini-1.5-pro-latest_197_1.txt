**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential aptitude for computer science. Many computer science students are drawn to the field for these very reasons. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business, his personality sketch leans more towards interests and strengths typically associated with STEM fields.  His love for nature and animals might suggest less alignment with the typical business administration student.
