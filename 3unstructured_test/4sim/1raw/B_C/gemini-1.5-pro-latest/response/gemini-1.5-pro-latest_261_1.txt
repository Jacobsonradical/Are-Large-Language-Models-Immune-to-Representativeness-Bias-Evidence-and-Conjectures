**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential alignment with computer science graduate students. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication are valuable in business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of business administration students, who often thrive in more social, fast-paced, and results-oriented environments.
