**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential similarity with computer science graduate students. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be found in business administration students, the overall profile leans more towards interests and skills often associated with STEM fields. His love for nature and animals doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business. 

**Note:** These are estimations based on a brief personality sketch. Individual students within any field can vary greatly.
