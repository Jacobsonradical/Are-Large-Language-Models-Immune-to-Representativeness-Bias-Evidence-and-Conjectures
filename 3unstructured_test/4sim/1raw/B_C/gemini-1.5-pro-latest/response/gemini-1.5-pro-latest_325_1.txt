**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His love for puzzles translates to problem-solving skills, a core aspect of computer science.  His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are also valuable traits in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work could be beneficial in business, his personality seems less characteristic of a typical business administration graduate student. His interest in nature and quiet demeanor might be less common in the generally more extroverted and business-focused world of business administration.
