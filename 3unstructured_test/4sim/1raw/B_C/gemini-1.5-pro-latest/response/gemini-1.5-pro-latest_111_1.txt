**Explanation:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student. Hence, a higher score of 0.7. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant to business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of the stereotype of a business administration student. Hence, a lower score of 0.3.
