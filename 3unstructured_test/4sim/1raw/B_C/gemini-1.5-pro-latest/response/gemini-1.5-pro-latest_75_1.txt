**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His love for puzzles translates to problem-solving skills, a core aspect of computer science. His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are crucial for this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work are valuable in business, his core interests in nature, animals, and potentially solitary activities (puzzles) suggest he might be less typical of a business administration graduate student. 

**Important Note:** These scores are based on general stereotypes and tendencies. Individual personalities within any field can vary greatly.
