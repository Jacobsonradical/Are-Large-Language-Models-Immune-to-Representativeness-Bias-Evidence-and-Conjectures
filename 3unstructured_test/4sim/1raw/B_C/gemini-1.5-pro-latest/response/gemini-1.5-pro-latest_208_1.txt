**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in business, his personality leans more towards intellectual and empathetic pursuits.  He might not be as drawn to the competitive, often financially driven aspects of a typical business administration program.

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the skills and interests of many computer science graduate students. His quiet nature is also common in the field.
