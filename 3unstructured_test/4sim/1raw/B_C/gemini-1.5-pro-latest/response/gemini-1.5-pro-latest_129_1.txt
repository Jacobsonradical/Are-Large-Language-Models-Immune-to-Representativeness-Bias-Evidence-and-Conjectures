**Explanation:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable traits in business, his personality leans more towards intellectual curiosity and empathy. These aren't as centrally important in a typical business administration program. 

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts strongly align with the skills and interests of many computer science graduate students.
