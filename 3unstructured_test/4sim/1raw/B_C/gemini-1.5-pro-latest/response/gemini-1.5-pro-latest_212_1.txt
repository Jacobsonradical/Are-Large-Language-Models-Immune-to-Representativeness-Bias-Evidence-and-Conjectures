**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, along with his ability to understand abstract concepts, suggest a strong affinity with the problem-solving and analytical nature of computer science. This makes him quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. 

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable traits in business, his personality sketch primarily highlights interests and strengths more aligned with scientific and analytical fields. His love for nature and animals, while admirable, isn't directly relevant to typical business administration studies. Therefore, he is less similar to a typical business administration student compared to a computer science student.
