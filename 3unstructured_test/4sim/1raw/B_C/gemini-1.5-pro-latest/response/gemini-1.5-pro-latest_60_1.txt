**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, combined with his ability to understand abstract concepts, make him more likely to be similar to a computer science graduate student.  Many in this field enjoy problem-solving and theoretical thinking. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in business, his other traits (love of nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of business administration graduate students, who often thrive in more social, fast-paced, and results-oriented environments.
