**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a computer science student. His love for puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are all valuable traits in this field. 

* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are beneficial in business, Adam's passion for nature, empathy, and quiet demeanor are less typical of a business administration graduate student.  This field often attracts individuals who are more extroverted, driven by profit and competition, and focused on interpersonal dynamics.
