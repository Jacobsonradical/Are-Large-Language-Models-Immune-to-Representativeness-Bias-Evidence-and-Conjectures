**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's personality aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are all valuable traits in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, Adam's core personality traits (love for nature, empathy, love for animals) are less typical of someone drawn to business administration.  His quiet nature might also be less common in this field.
