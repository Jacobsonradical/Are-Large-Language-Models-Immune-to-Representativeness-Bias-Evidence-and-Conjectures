Here's my assessment of Adam's personality fit with the given fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work could be valuable in business, his personality sketch leans more towards introversion and analytical thinking than the typical extroverted and leadership-focused traits often associated with business administration students. 
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the skills and interests of many computer science graduate students. His quiet nature also fits the stereotype of the field, although it's important to remember stereotypes don't represent everyone.
