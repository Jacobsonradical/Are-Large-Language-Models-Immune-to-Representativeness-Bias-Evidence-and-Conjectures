**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in business, his personality leans more towards intellectual and empathetic pursuits.  His love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts doesn't strongly align with a typical business administration student.

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, combined with his ability to grasp abstract concepts, make him more akin to a typical computer science graduate student. Computer science often involves problem-solving, logical thinking, and a certain level of abstract reasoning, aligning well with Adam's described traits.
