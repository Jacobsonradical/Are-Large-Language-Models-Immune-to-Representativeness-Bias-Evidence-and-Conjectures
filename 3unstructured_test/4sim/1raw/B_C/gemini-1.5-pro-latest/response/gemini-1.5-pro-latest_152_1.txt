**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable traits in business, his core interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts don't strongly align with a typical business administration graduate student. 

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential affinity with computer science. His high intelligence further supports this.  

**Important Note:** This is a speculative assessment based on a limited personality sketch.  Individual interests and career paths within these fields can vary greatly.
