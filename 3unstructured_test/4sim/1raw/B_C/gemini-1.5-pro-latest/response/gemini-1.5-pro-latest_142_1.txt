**Explanation:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are all traits often found in computer science graduate students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are important in business administration, Adam's personality description leans more towards interests and strengths often associated with STEM fields. His love for nature, animals, and potentially more introverted nature (implied by "quiet boy") make him seem less typical of a business administration graduate student.
