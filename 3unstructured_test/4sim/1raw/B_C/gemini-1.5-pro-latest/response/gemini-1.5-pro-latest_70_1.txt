**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all align well with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and an appreciation for hard work are valuable in business, Adam's other traits (love for nature, empathy, love for animals) are less typical of students drawn to the more analytical and profit-driven field of business administration.
