**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business administration, Adam's personality description leans more towards interests and strengths often found in individuals pursuing fields related to science or nature.  His quiet demeanor and strong empathy might not be as typical in a field that often emphasizes networking and assertiveness.
