Here's an assessment of Adam's personality traits against typical graduate student profiles:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with a typical computer science graduate student. While his nature affinity might seem less relevant, many computer scientists are drawn to the field's elegance and complexity, echoing aspects of the natural world.

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work could be valuable in business, his personality description lacks the ambition, drive for leadership, and focus on financial or organizational systems typically associated with business administration students.
