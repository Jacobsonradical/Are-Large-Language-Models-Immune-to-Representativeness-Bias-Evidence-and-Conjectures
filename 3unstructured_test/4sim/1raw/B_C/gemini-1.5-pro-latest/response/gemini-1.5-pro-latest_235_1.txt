**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, particularly with abstract concepts, align well with the skills and interests of many computer science graduate students.  
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant to business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of the stereotype of a business administration graduate student.
