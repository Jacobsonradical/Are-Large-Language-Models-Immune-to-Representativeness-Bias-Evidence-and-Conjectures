**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential aptitude for computer science. Many computer science programs also value curiosity and problem-solving skills. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his personality profile leans more towards interests and skills often associated with STEM fields. His empathy and love for animals don't strongly suggest a business inclination.
