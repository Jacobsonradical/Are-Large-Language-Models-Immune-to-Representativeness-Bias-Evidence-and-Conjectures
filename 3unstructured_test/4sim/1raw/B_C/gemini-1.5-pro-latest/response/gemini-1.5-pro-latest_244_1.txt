**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be found in business administration students, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, puzzle-solving) are less typical.  He might be drawn to more ethical and sustainable business practices, which is a growing field but not representative of the entire discipline.

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential affinity with computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking. His high intelligence further supports this assessment.
