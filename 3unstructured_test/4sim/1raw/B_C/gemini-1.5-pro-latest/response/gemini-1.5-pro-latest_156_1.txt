**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, particularly his ability to understand abstract concepts, align well with the skills and interests of many computer science graduate students.  His quiet nature is also somewhat common in the field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business, his other traits like his love for nature, animals, and quiet personality are less typical of business administration graduate students.  Business programs often attract individuals who are more extroverted and drawn to the challenges of management and finance.
