**Explanation:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is a trait often found in business administration students, his core interests in nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts suggest he might be less drawn to the typical focus on finance, marketing, and management. Hence, a moderate similarity score of 0.4.

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the problem-solving and analytical thinking required in computer science.  His high intelligence further supports this. Therefore, a higher similarity score of 0.7 seems appropriate.
