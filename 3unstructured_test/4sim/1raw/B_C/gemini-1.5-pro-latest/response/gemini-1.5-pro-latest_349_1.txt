Here's my assessment of Adam's personality in relation to typical graduate students in the given fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in business, his personality leans more towards intellectual and empathetic pursuits. Business administration often attracts individuals with a stronger drive for competition, leadership, and financial success. 

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the core skills of a computer science graduate student.  His quiet nature is also fairly common in the field.
