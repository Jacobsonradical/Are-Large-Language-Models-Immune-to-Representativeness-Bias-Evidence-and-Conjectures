Here's my assessment of Adam's personality fit with the given fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the skills and interests of a typical computer science graduate student. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business, his personality description leans more towards introversion and analytical thinking, which are less typical of business administration students who often thrive in social and leadership-oriented environments.
