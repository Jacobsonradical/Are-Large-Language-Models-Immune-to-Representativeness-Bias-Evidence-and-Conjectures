Here's an assessment of Adam's personality against typical graduate student profiles:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in business, his core interests in nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts don't directly align with the typical focus on finance, marketing, and management in business administration.  He might have some overlap (hence the 0.4), but he wouldn't be the most typical profile. 

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly resonate with the skills and interests often found in computer science graduate students.  His quiet and empathetic nature is also becoming increasingly common in the field.
