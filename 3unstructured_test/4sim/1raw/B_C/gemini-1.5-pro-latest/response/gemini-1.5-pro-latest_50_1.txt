**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a computer science student. His love for puzzles translates to problem-solving, a key skill in computer science. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are also crucial in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work are valuable in business, his core interests in nature, animals, and potentially solitary activities (puzzles) suggest less similarity with a typical business administration student who might be more drawn to leadership, networking, and market dynamics.
