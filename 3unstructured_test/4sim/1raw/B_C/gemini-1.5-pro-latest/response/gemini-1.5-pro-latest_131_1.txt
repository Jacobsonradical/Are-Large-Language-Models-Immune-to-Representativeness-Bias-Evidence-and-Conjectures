**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's personality aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His love for problem-solving, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are valuable traits in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work are relevant in business, his core interests in nature and animals suggest a less strong fit with the typical business administration student.  

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on stereotypes and limited information. There's a wide range of personalities within any field, and Adam could certainly thrive in either area.
