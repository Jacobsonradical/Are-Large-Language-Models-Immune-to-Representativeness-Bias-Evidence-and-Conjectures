**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student. Therefore, he scores relatively high (0.7). 

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business, his personality sketch leans more towards analytical and empathetic traits. This doesn't rule out business administration, but it's less strong of a match compared to computer science (0.4).
