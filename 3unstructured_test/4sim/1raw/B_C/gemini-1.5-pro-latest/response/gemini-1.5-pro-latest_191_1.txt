**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable traits in business, his core interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts suggest a less typical fit for a business administration graduate student. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the problem-solving and analytical nature of computer science, making him potentially more similar to a typical graduate student in this field. 

**Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and relies on general stereotypes of graduate students in these fields. Individual students within any field can vary greatly.
