**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the typical traits of a computer science graduate student.  While his love for nature might be less common, it's not unheard of, and his other traits suggest a strong aptitude for the field.

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication are valuable in business, his other traits are less typical of business administration graduate students.  Business programs often attract individuals who are more extroverted, leadership-oriented, and driven by financial success. Adam's quiet nature, empathy, and love for nature don't necessarily contradict these traits, but they are not as strong of indicators for this field.
