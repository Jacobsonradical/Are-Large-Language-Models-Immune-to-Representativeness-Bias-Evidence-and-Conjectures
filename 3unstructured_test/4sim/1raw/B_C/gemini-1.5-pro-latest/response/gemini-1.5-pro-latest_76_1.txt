**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, combined with his ability to understand abstract concepts, suggest a strong affinity with the problem-solving and analytical nature of computer science. This makes him more similar to a typical computer science graduate student.

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work could be valuable in business, his personality sketch lacks clear indicators of typical interests in business fields like finance, marketing, or management.  His love for nature and animals might even suggest a preference for fields outside of traditional business. Therefore, he is less similar to a typical business administration graduate student.
