**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is a trait often found in business administration students, his core interests in nature, animals, and puzzle-solving suggest a less conventional path.  He might have the intelligence for business, but his personality profile doesn't strongly align.

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential affinity with computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking.
