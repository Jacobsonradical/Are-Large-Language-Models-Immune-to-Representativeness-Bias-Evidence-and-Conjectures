**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student.  His enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work are all traits commonly found in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, Adam's core interests in nature, animals, and potentially quieter pursuits suggest he might be less typical of a business administration graduate student.
