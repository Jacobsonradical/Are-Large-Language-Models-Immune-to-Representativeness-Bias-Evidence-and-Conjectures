**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's personality aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His love for puzzles translates to problem-solving, a key skill in computer science.  His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are also strong indicators of suitability for this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of  business administration graduate students. This field often attracts individuals with stronger interpersonal skills and a focus on leadership and strategic thinking.
