Here's an analysis of Adam's personality and potential fit with the given fields:

**Analysis**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his high intelligence suggest he *could* thrive in computer science.  His strength in understanding abstract concepts is also highly relevant to this field. However, the description lacks clear indicators of a passion for technology, programming, or problem-solving within a digital context. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work are valuable in business, his profile leans more towards individual pursuits and intellectual curiosity.

```

**Explanation of Scores**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** There's a decent chance Adam could be similar to a computer science graduate student, driven by his intelligence and problem-solving skills.  However, the lack of direct indicators about his interests in technology keeps this score moderate.
* **Business Administration (0.3):** Adam's profile doesn't strongly align with the typical traits of a business administration student. The score is low, reflecting that while he possesses some transferable skills, his passions seem to lie elsewhere.
