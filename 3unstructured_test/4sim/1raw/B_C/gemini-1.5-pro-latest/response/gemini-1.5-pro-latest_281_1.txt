**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's personality traits align well with a computer science student. His love for puzzles, high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are common traits in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, Adam's deep empathy for animals and interest in nature seem less aligned with the typical business student's focus.  

**Note:** This assessment is based on stereotypes and generalizations. Individual students within each field can vary greatly.
