**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student.  
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work is relevant to business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of the stereotype of a business administration graduate student. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on broad generalizations and stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field are highly diverse.
