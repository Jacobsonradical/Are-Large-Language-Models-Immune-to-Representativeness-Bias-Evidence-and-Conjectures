Here's a breakdown of how Adam's personality might align with typical graduate students in the given fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and intelligence are valuable in business, his core interests (nature, animals, abstract concepts) don't strongly align with the typical focus on finance, marketing, and management found in business administration programs. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential affinity for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking. His quiet nature is also somewhat stereotypical of the field, though not a defining characteristic.

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses.  Personality is just one factor in determining success and fit within a field of study. There are many diverse individuals within both business and computer science.
