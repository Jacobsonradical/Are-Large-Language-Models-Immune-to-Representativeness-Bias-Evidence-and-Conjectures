**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His love for puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work are all traits commonly found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business administration, Adam's passion for nature, empathy, and quiet demeanor are less typical of students in this field. Business administration programs often attract individuals with stronger interpersonal, leadership, and strategic thinking skills.
