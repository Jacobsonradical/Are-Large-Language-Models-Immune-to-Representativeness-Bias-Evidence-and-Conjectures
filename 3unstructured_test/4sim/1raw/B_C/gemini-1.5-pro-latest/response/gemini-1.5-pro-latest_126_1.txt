* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential affinity with computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and have a logical, analytical mindset. His quiet nature is also fairly common among computer science students.
