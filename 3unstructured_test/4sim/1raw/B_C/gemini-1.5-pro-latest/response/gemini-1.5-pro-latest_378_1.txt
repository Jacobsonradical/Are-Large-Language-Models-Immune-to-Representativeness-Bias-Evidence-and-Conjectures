**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's personality aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His love for puzzles translates to problem-solving, a key skill in computer science. His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are also strong indicators of suitability for this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work are valuable traits in any field, they are less specific to business administration. His love for nature and quiet demeanor might suggest less inclination towards the fast-paced, often competitive world of business. 

**Note:** These are just educated guesses based on personality traits.  Individual interests and experiences play a huge role in career choices.
