**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a computer science student. His love for puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are common traits in computer science graduate students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business administration, Adam's passion for nature, empathy, and quiet nature are less typical of students in this field, who often are more extroverted and focused on interpersonal dynamics and leadership.
