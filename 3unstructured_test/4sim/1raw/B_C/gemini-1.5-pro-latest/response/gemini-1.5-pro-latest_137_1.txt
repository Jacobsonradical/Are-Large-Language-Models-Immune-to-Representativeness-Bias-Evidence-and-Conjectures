**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work are all traits commonly associated with individuals in this field. 

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence and work ethic could be beneficial in business, his personality seems less characteristic of a typical business administration student. His love for nature, empathy, and quiet demeanor might be less common in a field often associated with networking, assertiveness, and a focus on profit maximization.
