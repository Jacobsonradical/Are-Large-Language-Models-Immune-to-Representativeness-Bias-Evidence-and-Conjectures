Here's my assessment of Adam's potential fit with the given graduate fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his high intelligence, particularly with abstract concepts, are strong indicators of potential affinity for computer science.  Many problems in computer science are like intricate puzzles requiring logical thinking and problem-solving skills.  
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could be valuable in a business context, his personality sketch leans more towards introspective and analytical traits. Business administration often requires stronger interpersonal skills, networking aptitude, and a focus on financial growth, areas not highlighted in Adam's description. 

**Important Note:** This is a speculative assessment based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other factors influence a person's success and satisfaction in a particular field.
