**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be found in business students, his core personality traits seem a less natural fit for the field. His love for nature, empathy, and puzzle-solving aptitude don't align as strongly with the typical traits associated with business administration students. 

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are all characteristics often found in computer science students.  His quiet nature and love for animals may be less common but aren't unusual in the field.
