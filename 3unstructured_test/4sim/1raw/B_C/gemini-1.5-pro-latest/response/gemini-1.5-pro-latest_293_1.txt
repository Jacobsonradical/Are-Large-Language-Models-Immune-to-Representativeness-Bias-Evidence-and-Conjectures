**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his personality leans more towards intellectual and empathetic pursuits.  His love for nature and animals doesn't strongly correlate with a typical business administration student.
* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests of many computer science students. His quiet nature also fits the stereotype, though this is certainly not true for all in the field.
