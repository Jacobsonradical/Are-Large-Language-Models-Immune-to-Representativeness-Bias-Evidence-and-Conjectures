Here's my assessment of Adam's personality traits in relation to typical graduate students in the given fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in business, his personality leans more towards intellectual curiosity and empathy.  Business administration often attracts individuals with a stronger focus on leadership, competition, and financial analysis. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests of many computer science graduate students.  His quiet nature is also somewhat typical in the field.
