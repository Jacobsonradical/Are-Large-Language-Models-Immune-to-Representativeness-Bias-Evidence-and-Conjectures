**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the typical traits of a computer science graduate student. His quiet nature is also somewhat common in the field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work are valuable in business, his other traits (love of nature, deep love for animals, quiet nature) are less typical of business administration graduate students, who often lean towards being more extroverted and focused on interpersonal dynamics and financial success.
