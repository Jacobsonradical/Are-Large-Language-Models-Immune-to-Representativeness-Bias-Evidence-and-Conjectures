**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the typical traits of a computer science graduate student.  While his interest in nature might be less common, it's not unusual for individuals in STEM fields to have diverse interests. 
* **Business Administration:** Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be applicable in a business context. However, his personality sketch lacks clear indicators of traits commonly associated with business administration students, such as strong leadership, ambition for financial success, or interest in market dynamics.
