**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in business, his personality leans more towards analytical and empathetic pursuits.  He might not be as drawn to the competitive, often financially-driven aspects of a typical business administration program.

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential affinity with computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and have a strong analytical mindset.
