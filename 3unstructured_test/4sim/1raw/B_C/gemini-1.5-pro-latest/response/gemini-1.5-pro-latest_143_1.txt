    * **Problem-solving:** He enjoys solving puzzles, indicating a logical and analytical mind.
    * **High Intelligence:**  Essential for the complexities of computer science.
    * **Understanding Abstract Concepts:**  Crucial for programming and theoretical computer science.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, Adam's profile suggests less similarity:
