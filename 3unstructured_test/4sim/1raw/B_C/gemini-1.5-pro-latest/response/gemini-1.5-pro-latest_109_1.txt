**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student. Hence, a score of 0.7 reflects this higher similarity.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and an appreciation for hard work are valuable in business, Adam's core interests in nature, animals, and his quieter personality seem less aligned with a typical business administration student, who often lean towards interpersonal dynamics, leadership, and market analysis. Therefore, a score of 0.3 reflects this lower similarity.
