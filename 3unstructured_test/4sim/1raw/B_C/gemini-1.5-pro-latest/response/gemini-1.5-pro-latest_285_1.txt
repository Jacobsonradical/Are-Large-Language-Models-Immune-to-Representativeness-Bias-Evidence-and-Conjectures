Here's my assessment of Adam's personality against typical graduate student profiles:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his high intelligence, particularly his ability to grasp abstract concepts, strongly align with the typical profile of a computer science graduate student.  While his interest in nature might seem less typical, many computer scientists are drawn to the field due to its elegant logic and patterns, which can be seen as mirroring nature's complexity.

* **Business Administration:** Adam's empathy and warm heart, while positive traits, are not as central to the typical image of a business administration graduate student. This field often attracts individuals focused on leadership, strategy, and potentially more competitive environments. While his appreciation for hard work is valuable, it alone doesn't make him a strong fit for the typical mold.
