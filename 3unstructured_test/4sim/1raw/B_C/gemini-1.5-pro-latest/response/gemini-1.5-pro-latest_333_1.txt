Here's my assessment of Adam's personality sketch in relation to typical graduate students in the given fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business, his core personality traits seem more aligned with scientific or analytical fields.  His love for nature, puzzle-solving abilities, and understanding of abstract concepts don't directly translate to the typical focus of a business administration graduate student.

* **Computer Science:**  Adam's puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential aptitude in computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy logic, problem-solving, and have a certain curiosity about how things work, aligning well with Adam's description.
