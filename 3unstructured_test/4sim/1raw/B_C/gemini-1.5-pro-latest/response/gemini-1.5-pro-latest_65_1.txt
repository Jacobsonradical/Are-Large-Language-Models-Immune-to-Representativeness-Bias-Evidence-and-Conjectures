**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be seen as aligning with business students, his core interests in nature, animals, and puzzle-solving don't strongly suggest a business inclination. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential aptitude and interest in computer science.  His high intelligence further supports this.
