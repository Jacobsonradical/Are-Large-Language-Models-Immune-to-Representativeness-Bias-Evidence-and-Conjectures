**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business, his personality leans more towards intellectual and empathetic pursuits.  A typical business administration student might be more extroverted, focused on leadership and strategy, and less drawn to nature.

* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the typical computer science student.  His quiet nature is also common in the field.
