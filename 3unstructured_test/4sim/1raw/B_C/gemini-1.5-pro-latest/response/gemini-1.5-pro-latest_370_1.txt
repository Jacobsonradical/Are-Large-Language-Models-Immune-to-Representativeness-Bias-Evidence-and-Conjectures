**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a computer science graduate student. His love for puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are all traits commonly found in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, Adam's passion for nature, empathy, and quiet demeanor seem less typical of a business administration student. Business students often exhibit stronger interpersonal and leadership skills, which are not emphasized in Adam's description.
