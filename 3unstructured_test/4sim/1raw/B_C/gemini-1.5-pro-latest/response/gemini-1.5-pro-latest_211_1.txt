**Explanation:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence, work ethic, and understanding of abstract concepts could be beneficial in business, his personality description leans more towards scientific and empathetic interests. He might not be as drawn to the competitive and often financially driven aspects of a typical business administration program.

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with a typical computer science student's profile. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking, making it a closer match for Adam's personality.
