**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, particularly with abstract concepts, strongly align with the skills and interests of a typical computer science graduate student. This field often involves problem-solving, logical thinking, and understanding complex systems. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in business, his other traits suggest a less typical fit. His love for nature, empathy, and quiet demeanor don't align as strongly with the typical image of a business administration graduate student, who might be more drawn to leadership, networking, and potentially competitive environments. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic assessment based on limited information and general stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field are diverse, and Adam's true fit could vary.
