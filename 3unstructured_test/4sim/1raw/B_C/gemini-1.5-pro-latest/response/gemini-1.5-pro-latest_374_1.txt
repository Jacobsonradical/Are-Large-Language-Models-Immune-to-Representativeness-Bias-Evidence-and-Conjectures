**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential similarity to computer science graduate students. While his nature-oriented interests might seem less aligned, many computer scientists appreciate the intersection of technology and the natural world. 

* **Business Administration:**  While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication is valuable in any field, his personality profile seems less characteristic of a typical business administration graduate student. The description emphasizes empathy and love for animals, which are not traditionally associated with business focuses.
