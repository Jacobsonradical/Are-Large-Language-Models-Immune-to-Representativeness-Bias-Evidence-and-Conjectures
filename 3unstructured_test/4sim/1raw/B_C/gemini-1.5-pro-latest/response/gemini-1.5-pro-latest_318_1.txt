Here's an assessment of Adam's personality against the typical graduate student in each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in business, his personality leans more towards intellectual curiosity and empathy. Business administration often attracts individuals with strong leadership, networking, and sometimes more assertive qualities, which aren't highlighted in Adam's description.

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving, logical thinking, and have a strong foundation in mathematics and analytical thinking.
