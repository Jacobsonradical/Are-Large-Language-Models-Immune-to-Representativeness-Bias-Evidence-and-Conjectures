**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His love for puzzles, high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and appreciation for dedication are all valuable traits in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are useful in business, Adam's passion for nature, empathy, and quiet demeanor are less characteristic of a typical business administration student.  They might be found in some, but aren't as strong of indicators as they are for computer science.
