Here's my assessment of Adam's personality fit with the given fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the typical traits of a computer science graduate student. While his nature affinity might seem less relevant, many computer scientists appreciate the elegance and complexity found in nature. 

* **Business Administration:**  While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work are valuable in business, his personality profile seems less characteristic of a typical business administration student. Business programs often attract individuals with strong leadership, networking, and potentially more competitive traits.
