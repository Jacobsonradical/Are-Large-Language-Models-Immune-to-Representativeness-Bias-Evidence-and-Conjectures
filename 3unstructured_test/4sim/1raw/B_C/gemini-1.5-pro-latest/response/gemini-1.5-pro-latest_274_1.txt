**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential similarity with computer science graduate students. This field often attracts individuals with those traits.
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is positive, his personality sketch lacks clear indicators of a strong interest in business, finance, marketing, or other common focuses within business administration. His empathy and love for animals might even suggest alternative career paths. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on a very limited personality sketch. Individual students within any field can be highly diverse.
