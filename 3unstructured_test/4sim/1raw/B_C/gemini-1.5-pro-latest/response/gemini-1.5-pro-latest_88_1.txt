Here's my assessment of Adam's personality fit with the given fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work could be helpful in business, his personality sketch leans more towards interests and strengths common in STEM fields. His love for nature and animals suggests his passions might lie outside the corporate world. 

**Important Note:** This is a speculative assessment based on a brief personality sketch.  Many other factors influence a person's suitability and success in a particular field.
