**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential similarity with computer science graduate students. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be found in business students, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of the stereotype of a business administration graduate student.
