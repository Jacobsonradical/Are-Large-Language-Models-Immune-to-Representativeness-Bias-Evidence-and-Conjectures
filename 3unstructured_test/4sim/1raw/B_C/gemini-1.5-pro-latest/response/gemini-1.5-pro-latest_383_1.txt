**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, Adam's personality description leans more towards interests and traits commonly associated with STEM fields. His empathy and love for nature might be less typical in a business administration program.
