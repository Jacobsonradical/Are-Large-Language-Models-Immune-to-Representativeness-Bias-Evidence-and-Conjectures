Here's my assessment of Adam's personality sketch against the two fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence, work ethic, and understanding of concepts would be valuable in business, his personality leans more towards individual pursuits. His love for nature, animals, and quiet problem-solving doesn't strongly align with the typical image of a business-oriented individual.

* **Computer Science:**  Adam's love for puzzles, abstract thinking, and intelligence strongly suggest an affinity for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy logic, problem-solving, and systems thinking, aligning well with his described traits.
