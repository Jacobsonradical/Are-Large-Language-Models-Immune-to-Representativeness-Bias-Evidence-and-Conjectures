**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business, his personality leans more towards intellectual and empathetic pursuits.  His love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts doesn't strongly align with the core focus of a typical business administration student.

* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, particularly in understanding abstract concepts, are strong indicators of potential affinity with computer science.  This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking.
