**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a computer science student. His love for puzzles, high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work are all valuable traits in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence and work ethic could be beneficial in business, his personality seems less characteristic of a typical business administration student. His quiet nature, empathy, and love for animals and nature suggest interests that might not be as central to this field. 

**Note:** These are just estimations based on a personality sketch. Individual students within any field can vary greatly.
