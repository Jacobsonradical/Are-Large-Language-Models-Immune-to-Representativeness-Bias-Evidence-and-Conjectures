**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student.  His quiet nature also fits the stereotype, although it's not a universal trait in the field.

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication is valuable in a business context, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of the stereotype of a business administration graduate student, who might be more focused on leadership, networking, and potentially more extroverted.
