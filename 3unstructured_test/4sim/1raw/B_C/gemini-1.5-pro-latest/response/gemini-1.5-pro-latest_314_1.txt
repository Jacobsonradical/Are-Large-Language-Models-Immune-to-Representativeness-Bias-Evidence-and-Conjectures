**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in business, his personality leans more towards solitary pursuits and intellectual exploration.  Business administration often involves networking, leadership, and a focus on financial outcomes, which aren't strongly reflected in his description. 

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the problem-solving and analytical nature of computer science. His quiet demeanor is also common among those drawn to technical fields.
