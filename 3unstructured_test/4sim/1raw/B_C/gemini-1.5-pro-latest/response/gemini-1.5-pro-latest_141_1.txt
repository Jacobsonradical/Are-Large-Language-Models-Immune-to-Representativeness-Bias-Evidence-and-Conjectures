**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests of a typical computer science graduate student. Hence, a score of 0.7 reflecting a significant similarity. 

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable traits in business, his other characteristics (love for nature, empathy for animals, quiet demeanor) are less typical of the field. Thus, a score of 0.3 indicating a lower similarity.
