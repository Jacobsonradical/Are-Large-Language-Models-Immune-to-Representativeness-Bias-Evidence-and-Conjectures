**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in business, his personality leans more towards intellectual and empathetic pursuits. Business administration often prioritizes competitiveness and profit-driven goals, which aren't directly reflected in Adam's description.

* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and quiet nature align well with the traits often found in computer science graduate students. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and have strong analytical skills.
