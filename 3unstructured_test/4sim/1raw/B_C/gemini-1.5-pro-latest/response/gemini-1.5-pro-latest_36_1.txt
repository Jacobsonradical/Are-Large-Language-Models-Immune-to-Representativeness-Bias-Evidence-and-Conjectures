* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His love for puzzles translates to problem-solving, a crucial skill in computer science. His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are also valuable in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence and work ethic could be beneficial in business administration, his personality seems less characteristic of this field. His empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature suggest different passions than what typically drives business students.
