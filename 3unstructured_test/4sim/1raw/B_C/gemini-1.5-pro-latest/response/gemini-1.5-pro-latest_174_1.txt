**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in business, his personality leans more towards intellectual and empathetic pursuits. He might not be as drawn to the competitive, often financially-driven aspects of a typical business administration program.

* **Computer Science:**  Adam's love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the characteristics of a typical computer science graduate student. His quiet nature also fits the stereotype of someone who enjoys working with technology.
