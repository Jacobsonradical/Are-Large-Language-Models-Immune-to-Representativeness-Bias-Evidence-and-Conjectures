**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential affinity with computer science. Many in this field share his curiosity and problem-solving drive. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication is valuable in any field, his personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a typical business administration student. Traits like assertiveness, strong networking skills, and a focus on profit maximization are not mentioned, which are often more typical in that field. 

**Note:** This assessment is based on a brief personality sketch and general stereotypes.  Individual students within each field can vary greatly.
