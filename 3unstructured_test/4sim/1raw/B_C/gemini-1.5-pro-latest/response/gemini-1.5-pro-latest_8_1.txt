**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are strongly aligned with a typical computer science graduate student. His high intelligence further supports this. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant to business administration, his other traits (love for nature, empathy for animals, quiet demeanor) are less typical of students in this field.
