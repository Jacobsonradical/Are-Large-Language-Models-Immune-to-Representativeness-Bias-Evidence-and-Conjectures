**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, particularly with abstract concepts, align well with the skills and interests of many computer science graduate students. His quiet nature also fits the stereotype of the field, though it's important to note this is a generalization. 

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in business, his other traits seem less typical for this field. His love for nature, animals, and his quiet demeanor don't align as strongly with the common image of a business administration graduate student.
