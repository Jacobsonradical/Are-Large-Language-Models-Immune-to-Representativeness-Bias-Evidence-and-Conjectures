**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a computer science graduate student. His love for puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are all traits commonly found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business administration, Adam's love for nature, empathy, and quiet demeanor are less typical of students in this field. Business administration often attracts individuals who are more extroverted and driven by financial success or leadership roles.
