**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his personality leans more towards intellectual curiosity and empathy. These traits are not as centrally associated with a typical business administration graduate student.

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the traits often found in computer science graduate students.  His quiet nature also fits the stereotype, though it's certainly not a requirement for the field.
