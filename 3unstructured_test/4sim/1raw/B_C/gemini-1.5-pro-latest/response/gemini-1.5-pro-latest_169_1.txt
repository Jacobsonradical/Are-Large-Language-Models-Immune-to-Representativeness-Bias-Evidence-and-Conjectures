**Explanation:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, along with his ability to grasp abstract concepts, make him potentially quite similar to a computer science graduate student.  
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable traits in business, his other characteristics (love of nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) don't align as strongly with the typical stereotype of a business administration graduate student.
