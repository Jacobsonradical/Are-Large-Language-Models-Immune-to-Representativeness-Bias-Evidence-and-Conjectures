**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business, his personality leans more towards intellectual and empathetic pursuits.  A typical business administration student might be more extroverted, networking-focused, and driven by profit and market trends. 

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests of many computer science graduate students. His quiet nature is also not uncommon in the field.
