**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student. While his love for nature might be less common, it's not unusual for individuals in STEM fields to have diverse interests. 

* **Business Administration:**  While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication is valuable in business, his personality profile leans more towards introversion and analytical thinking rather than the interpersonal skills and focus on profit maximization often associated with business administration.
