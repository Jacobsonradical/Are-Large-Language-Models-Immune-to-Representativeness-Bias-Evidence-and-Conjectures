**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, coupled with his ability to grasp abstract concepts, strongly suggest an affinity with computer science. This field often attracts individuals with these traits. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business, his personality profile leans more towards intellectual curiosity and empathy.  These traits are less typical of a business administration graduate student, who often prioritize leadership, strategy, and financial acumen.
