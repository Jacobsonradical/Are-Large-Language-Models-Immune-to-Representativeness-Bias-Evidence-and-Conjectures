**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in business, his personality leans more towards analytical and empathetic pursuits. Business administration often involves strong networking, negotiation, and sometimes a focus on profit maximization, which don't seem to align as strongly with Adam's described traits.

* **Computer Science:**  Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential affinity with computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and have a logical, analytical mindset. His quiet nature might also be well-suited to the field.
