Here's my assessment of Adam's potential fit with the given fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential in computer science. Many computer science problems involve logical thinking and problem-solving, aligning well with his personality.  His high intelligence is also a plus in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work are valuable traits in any field, they don't directly translate to a typical business administration graduate student profile. Business administration often focuses on leadership, strategic thinking, and sometimes competitive environments, which are not highlighted in Adam's description. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on a very brief personality sketch.  Many other factors influence a person's success and enjoyment in a particular field.
