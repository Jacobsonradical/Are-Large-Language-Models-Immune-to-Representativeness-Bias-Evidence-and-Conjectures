**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the typical traits of a computer science graduate student.  His quiet nature is also somewhat common in the field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could be seen as a positive trait in business, his other characteristics (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of students in this field, who often lean towards being more outgoing, driven by profit and market forces.
