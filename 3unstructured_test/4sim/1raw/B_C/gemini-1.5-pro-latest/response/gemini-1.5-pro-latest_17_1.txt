**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a computer science graduate student. His love for puzzles translates to problem-solving, a key skill in computer science. High intelligence and an ability to grasp abstract concepts are crucial for this field.  His quiet nature is also somewhat common among CS students.

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence and work ethic could be assets in business, his personality description lacks clear indicators of a strong interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or management.  His empathy and love for animals might suggest different career paths.  Therefore, he is less likely to be similar to a typical business administration graduate student.
