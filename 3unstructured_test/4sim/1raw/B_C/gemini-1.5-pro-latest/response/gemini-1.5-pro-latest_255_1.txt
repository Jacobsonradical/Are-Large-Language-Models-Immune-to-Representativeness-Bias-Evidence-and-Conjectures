**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a computer science graduate student. His love for puzzles translates to problem-solving, a key skill in computer science. His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are also strong indicators of affinity for the field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work are valuable in business, his core interests in nature, animals, and potentially solitary activities (puzzles) suggest a personality less drawn to the competitive and often human-centric world of business administration.
