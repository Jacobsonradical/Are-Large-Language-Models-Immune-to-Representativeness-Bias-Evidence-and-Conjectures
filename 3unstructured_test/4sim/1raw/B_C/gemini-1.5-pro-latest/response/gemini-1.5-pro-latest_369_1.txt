**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence align well with the problem-solving nature of computer science. His ability to understand abstract concepts is also a valuable trait in this field.  While his love for nature might not be directly relevant, it's not uncommon for people in technical fields to have diverse interests. 
* **Business Administration:** While "hard work and dedication" are valued in business,  Adam's personality description emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature. These traits are less typical of someone drawn to the competitive, often more commercially-focused world of business administration.
