Here's my assessment of Adam's personality against the two fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant to business, his other traits (love for nature, empathy for animals) are less typical of someone drawn to a business career. 

**Important Note:** This is a speculative assessment based on a brief personality sketch. Individual personalities within any field can vary greatly.
