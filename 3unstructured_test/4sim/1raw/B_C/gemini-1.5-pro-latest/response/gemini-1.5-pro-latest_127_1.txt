**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's personality aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His enjoyment of puzzles translates to problem-solving, a core skill in computer science. His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are also valuable in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence and work ethic could be assets in business, his personality seems less aligned with a typical business administration student. His love for nature, empathy, and quiet demeanor might be less common in a field often associated with extroversion and a focus on financial gain. 

**Note:** These are just estimations based on general personality trends in these fields. There can be significant variation within any field of study.
