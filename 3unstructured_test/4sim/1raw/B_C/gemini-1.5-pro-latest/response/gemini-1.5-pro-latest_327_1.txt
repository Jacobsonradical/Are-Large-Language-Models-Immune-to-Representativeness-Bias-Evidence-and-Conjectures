**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication might be found in business students, his core personality traits (love for nature, empathy, enjoyment of puzzles) don't align as strongly with the typical image of a business administration graduate student. 

* **Computer Science:**  Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential similarity with computer science students.  This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and have a strong analytical mindset.
