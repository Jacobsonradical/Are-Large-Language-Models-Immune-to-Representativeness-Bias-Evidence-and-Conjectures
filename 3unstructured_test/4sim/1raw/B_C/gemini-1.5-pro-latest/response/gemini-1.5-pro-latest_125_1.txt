* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a computer science student.  His love for puzzles translates to problem-solving, a key skill in computer science.  His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are also strong indicators. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, Adam's interests in nature, empathy, and love for animals don't typically align as strongly with the core values often associated with business administration.
