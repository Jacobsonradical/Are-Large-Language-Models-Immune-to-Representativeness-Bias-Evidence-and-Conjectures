Here's my assessment of Adam's personality against typical graduate student profiles:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests of many computer science graduate students. While his love for nature might be less common in this field, it's not unusual.

* **Business Administration:** Adam's empathy and warmth, while positive traits, are less typical markers of success in the traditionally competitive and metric-driven field of business administration.  His interest in nature and dedication to hard work don't strongly suggest a leaning towards business studies.
