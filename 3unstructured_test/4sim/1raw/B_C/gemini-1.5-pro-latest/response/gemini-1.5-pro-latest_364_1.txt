**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, Adam's core interests (nature, empathy, animals) seem less aligned with the typical focus of a business administration program.
