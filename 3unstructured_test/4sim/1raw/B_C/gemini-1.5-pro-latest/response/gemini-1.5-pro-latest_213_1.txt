**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's personality aligns well with a computer science student. His love for puzzles translates to problem-solving, a key skill in computer science. His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are also strong indicators of potential in the field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, Adam's empathy, love for animals, and quiet nature are less typical of the stereotype of a business administration graduate student. His interest in nature may suggest alternative career interests.
