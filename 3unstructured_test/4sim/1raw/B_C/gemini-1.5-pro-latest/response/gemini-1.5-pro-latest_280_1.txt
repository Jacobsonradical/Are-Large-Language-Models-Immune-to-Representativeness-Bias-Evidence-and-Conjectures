Here's why:

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business, his personality leans more towards intellectual and empathetic pursuits. Business administration often involves a strong focus on competition, networking, and financial gain, which might not align perfectly with Adam's core interests. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, abstract thinking, and intellectual challenges aligns well with the core skills of a computer science graduate student. His quiet nature is also fairly common in the field.
