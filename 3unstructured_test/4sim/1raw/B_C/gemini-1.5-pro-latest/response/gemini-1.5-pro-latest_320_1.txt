**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential similarity with computer science graduate students. These traits are highly valued and often found in individuals pursuing this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work could be seen as somewhat relevant to business, his core interests in nature, animals, and potentially solitary activities (puzzles) suggest less similarity with a typical business administration graduate student. Business administration often attracts individuals with stronger interests in leadership, management, finance, and interpersonal dynamics.
