**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and an appreciation for hard work are valuable in business, Adam's personality leans more towards interests and strengths often found in STEM fields. His love for nature and animals, along with his quiet demeanor, suggest he might not be as drawn to the fast-paced, people-oriented nature of typical business administration programs.
