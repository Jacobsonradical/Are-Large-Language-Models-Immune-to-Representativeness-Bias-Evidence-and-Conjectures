**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's personality aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His love for puzzles translates to problem-solving skills, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are crucial for the field, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication are essential for research and development. 

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, his personality profile leans more towards introversion and analytical thinking than the typical extroverted and people-oriented nature often associated with business administration students.  

**Note:** These are just estimations based on a personality sketch. Individual students within any field can vary greatly.
