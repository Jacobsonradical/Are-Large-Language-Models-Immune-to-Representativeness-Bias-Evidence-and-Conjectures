**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's personality aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His love for puzzles translates to problem-solving, a core skill in computer science. His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are also valuable traits in the field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work are positive attributes in any field, they are less defining characteristics of a typical business administration graduate student compared to someone in computer science.  His interest in nature and animals suggests his passions might lie outside the business world.
