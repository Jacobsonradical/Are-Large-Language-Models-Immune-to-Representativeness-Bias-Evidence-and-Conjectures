**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a computer science graduate student. His love for puzzles translates to problem-solving skills, a core aspect of computer science. His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts are crucial in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work are valuable in business, his core interests in nature, animals, and potentially solitary activities (puzzles) are less typical of business administration students.
