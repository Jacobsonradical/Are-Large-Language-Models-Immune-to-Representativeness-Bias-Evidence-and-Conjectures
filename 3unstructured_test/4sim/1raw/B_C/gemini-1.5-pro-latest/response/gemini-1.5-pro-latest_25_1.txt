**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication might resonate with some aspects of business administration, his core interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts don't strongly align with the typical focus of a business administration graduate student. 

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, particularly in understanding abstract concepts, are strong indicators of potential similarities with computer science students. His quiet nature is also a common trait within that field.
