**Explanation:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, his personality leans more towards intellectual and empathetic pursuits.  He might not be as drawn to the competitive and often financially driven aspects of a typical business administration program.

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests of many computer science graduate students.  His quiet nature is also fairly common in the field.
