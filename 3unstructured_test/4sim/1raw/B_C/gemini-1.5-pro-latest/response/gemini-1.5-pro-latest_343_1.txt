Here's my assessment of Adam's personality sketch in relation to typical graduate students in the given fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business, his personality leans more towards introversion and analytical thinking than the typical extroverted and networking-focused MBA student. 
* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles, abstract thinking, and quiet focus align well with the traits often found in computer science students. His empathy and love for animals might be less common but don't necessarily detract from his similarity. 

**Important Note:** This is a speculative assessment based on a brief personality sketch.  Individual students within any field can vary greatly.
