**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong traits often found in computer science graduate students.  His quiet nature also aligns somewhat with the stereotype, though this is not universal. 
* **Business Administration:** While "hard work and dedication" are valued in business, Adam's other traits (love of nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of the stereotype of a business administration graduate student, who might be more extroverted and focused on interpersonal dynamics and leadership. 

**Important Note:**  These scores are based on general stereotypes and limited information.  It's impossible to accurately predict someone's field of study based solely on a personality sketch.
