**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, particularly with abstract concepts, align well with the skills and interests of many computer science graduate students. His quiet nature is also somewhat stereotypical of the field.  
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication is valuable in any field, the personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a typical business administration student. His interests in nature, animals, and empathy might be less common focuses in that field. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on stereotypes and limited information. Individual personalities within any field vary greatly.
