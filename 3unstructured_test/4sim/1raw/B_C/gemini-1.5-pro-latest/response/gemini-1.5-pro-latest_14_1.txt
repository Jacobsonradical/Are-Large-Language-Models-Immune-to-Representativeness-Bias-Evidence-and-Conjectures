Here's an assessment of Adam's personality against typical graduate student profiles:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business, his core interests (nature, animals, abstract concepts) are less aligned with typical business school focuses (finance, marketing, strategy).  
* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential affinity with computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking. His quiet nature also somewhat aligns with the stereotype of a computer science student. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and general stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field can vary widely.
