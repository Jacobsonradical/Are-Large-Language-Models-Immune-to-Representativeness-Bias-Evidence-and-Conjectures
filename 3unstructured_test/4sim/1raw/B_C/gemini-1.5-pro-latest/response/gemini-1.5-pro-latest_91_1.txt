**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's personality aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His love for puzzles, high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are all valuable traits in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are appreciated in business, Adam's core personality traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of individuals drawn to the more competitive, profit-driven world of business administration.
