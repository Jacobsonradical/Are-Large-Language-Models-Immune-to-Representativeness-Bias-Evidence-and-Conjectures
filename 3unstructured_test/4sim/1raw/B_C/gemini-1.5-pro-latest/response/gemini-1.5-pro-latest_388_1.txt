**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, particularly his understanding of abstract concepts, align well with the skills and interests of many computer science graduate students. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant in a business context, his other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of the stereotype of a business administration student. 
 
**Note:** These are just estimations based on general stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field are incredibly diverse.
