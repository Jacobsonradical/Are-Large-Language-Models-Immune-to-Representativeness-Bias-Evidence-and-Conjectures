**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business, his personality leans more towards intellectual and empathetic pursuits. His love for nature and animals might suggest less interest in the corporate world. 
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts align strongly with the skills and interests of many computer science graduate students. His high intelligence further supports this.
