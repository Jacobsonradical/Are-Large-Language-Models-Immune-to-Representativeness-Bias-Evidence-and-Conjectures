**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile, highlighting his intelligence, problem-solving skills (puzzles), understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work, aligns well with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business administration, Adam's deep interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals seem less aligned with the typical focus of a business administration student.  

**Note:** This assessment is based on stereotypes and limited information about Adam. Individual graduate students within each field can be quite diverse.
