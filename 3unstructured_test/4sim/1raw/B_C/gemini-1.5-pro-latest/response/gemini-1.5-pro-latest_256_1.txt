**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His love for problem-solving, high intelligence, comfort with abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are all valuable traits in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are useful in business, Adam's passion for nature, empathy, and quiet demeanor seem less typical of a business administration graduate student. Business programs often attract individuals with stronger interpersonal, leadership, and sometimes more assertive qualities.
