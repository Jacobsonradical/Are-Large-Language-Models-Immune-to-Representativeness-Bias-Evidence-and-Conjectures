Here's an assessment based on the provided information about Adam:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's profile aligns well with common traits of computer science graduate students:
    * **Problem-solving:** Puzzles are a form of problem-solving, a core skill in computer science.
    * **Abstract thinking:** Computer science often deals with abstract concepts and algorithms.
    * **Intelligence:**  The field demands a high level of intellectual capability.

* **Business Administration:** While Adam possesses some traits relevant to business (like understanding hard work), his profile leans more towards analytical and empathetic tendencies. 
    * **Empathy and love for animals:** These traits, while positive, are not as directly applicable to a typical business administration curriculum compared to computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a speculative assessment.  Personality alone doesn't determine success or fit in a field. Many other factors (specific interests, skills, experiences) contribute to a graduate student's profile.
