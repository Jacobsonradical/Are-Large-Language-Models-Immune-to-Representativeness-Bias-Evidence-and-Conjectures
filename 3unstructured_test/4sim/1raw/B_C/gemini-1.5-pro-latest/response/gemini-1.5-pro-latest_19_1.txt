**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be found in business administration students, his personality profile leans more towards intellectual curiosity and empathy. These traits are not as typical in a field primarily focused on business strategy, finance, and management.

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts strongly align with the typical profile of a computer science graduate student. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking, making him a closer fit.
