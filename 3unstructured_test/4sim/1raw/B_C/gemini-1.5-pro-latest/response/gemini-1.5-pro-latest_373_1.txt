**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, coupled with his ability to grasp abstract concepts, strongly suggest a similarity to computer science graduate students.  This field often attracts individuals with these traits.
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work are valuable in business, his core interests in nature, animals, and potentially solitary activities like puzzle-solving make him less typical of a business administration graduate student. This field often draws individuals with more extroverted personalities and a stronger focus on interpersonal dynamics and financial success.
