Here's my assessment of Adam's personality against the two fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work could be assets in business, his personality sketch leans more towards introversion and analytical thinking rather than the leadership and networking often associated with business administration. 
* **Computer Science:**  Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, ability to grasp abstract concepts, and quiet nature are strong indicators of a personality that aligns well with computer science.
