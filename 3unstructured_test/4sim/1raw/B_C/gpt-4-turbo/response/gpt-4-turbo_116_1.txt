Adam's traits, such as his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, coupled with his love for solving puzzles, suggest a good fit with computer science, where such skills are fundamental. In contrast, while his intelligence could also benefit him in business administration, his strong emphases on love for nature, animals, and perhaps lesser focus on people management or profit-oriented thinking, make him slightly less typical in the business field.
