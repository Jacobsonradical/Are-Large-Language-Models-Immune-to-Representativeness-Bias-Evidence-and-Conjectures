Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he would be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for nature and hard work seem less directly relevant to computer science.

While Adam's intelligence would serve him well in business administration, his personality sketch suggests he may be less outgoing and business-oriented than the typical MBA student. His curiosity and problem solving skills could be an asset, but overall he seems to have less in common with the average business administration graduate student profile compared to computer science.
