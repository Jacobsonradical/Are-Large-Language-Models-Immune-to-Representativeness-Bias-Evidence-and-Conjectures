Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. However, his warm heart, empathy and love of nature and animals are less typical traits for that field.

Business administration seems like it may be a poorer fit overall given the personality description. While Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication are relevant, many of his other traits like introversion and abstract thinking are less commonly associated with business.

Of course, any individual can succeed in a variety of fields regardless of stereotypes. This is just my best estimate based on the limited information provided about how Adam compares to an average graduate student in these disciplines. Let me know if you would like me to explain my reasoning further.
