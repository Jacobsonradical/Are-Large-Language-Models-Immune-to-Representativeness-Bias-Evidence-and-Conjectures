Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His warm heart, empathy and love of animals are less directly relevant to the field.

Some of his traits like hard work and dedication would be assets in business administration. But overall, his profile seems less aligned with a typical MBA student, who may be more outgoing and business-oriented.

Of course, there is a lot of individual variation, and many factors beyond this brief sketch would determine fit with a particular field. This is just my best estimate based on the information provided.
