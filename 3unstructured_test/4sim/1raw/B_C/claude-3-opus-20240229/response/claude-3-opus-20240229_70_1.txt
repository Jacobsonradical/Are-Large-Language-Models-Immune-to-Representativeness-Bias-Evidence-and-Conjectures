Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His warm heart, empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication are positive qualities but less directly relevant to the typical computer science graduate student profile.

Business administration seems like it may be a less natural fit given the details provided. The personality sketch doesn't highlight entrepreneurial drive, leadership, or interpersonal skills that are often associated with business. However, intelligence, problem-solving and work ethic are still assets in that field.

Of course, this is a simplified assessment based on limited information. Many other factors beyond this brief sketch would determine an individual's true compatibility with and success in a particular graduate program.
