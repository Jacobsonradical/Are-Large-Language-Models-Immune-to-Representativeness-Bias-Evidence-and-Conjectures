Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with graduate studies in computer science. His quieter nature and love of puzzles also seem compatible with this field.

While he may share some traits with business administration students like understanding the value of hard work, overall his interests and personality seem less aligned with that field based on the information provided. His empathy and love of animals and nature are less directly relevant to typical business administration studies.
