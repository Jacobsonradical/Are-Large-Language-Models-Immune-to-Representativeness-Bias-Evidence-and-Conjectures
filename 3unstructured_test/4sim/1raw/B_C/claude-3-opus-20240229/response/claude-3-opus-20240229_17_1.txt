Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's quiet nature, love of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His genuine curiosity, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit with business administration to some degree, but the overall profile seems to align more closely with computer science in my estimation.
