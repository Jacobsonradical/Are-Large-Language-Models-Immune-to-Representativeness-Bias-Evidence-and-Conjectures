Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align well with qualities often found in computer science graduate students. His quiet nature and love of solving puzzles also seem to fit that field.

While he has an appreciation for hard work and dedication which is important in business, other traits like his curiosity about plants, love of animals, and warm empathetic heart seem less typical of business administration students, so I rated the similarity a bit lower for that field. Of course, there is a lot of individual variation in any field.
