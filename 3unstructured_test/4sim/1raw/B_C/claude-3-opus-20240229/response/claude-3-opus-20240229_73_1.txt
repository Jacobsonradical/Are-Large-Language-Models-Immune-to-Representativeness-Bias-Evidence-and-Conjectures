Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he would be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. However, his personality seems less similar to a typical business administration student, as the sketch emphasizes more his empathy, love of nature and animals, and appreciation for hard work rather than typical business-oriented traits and interests.
