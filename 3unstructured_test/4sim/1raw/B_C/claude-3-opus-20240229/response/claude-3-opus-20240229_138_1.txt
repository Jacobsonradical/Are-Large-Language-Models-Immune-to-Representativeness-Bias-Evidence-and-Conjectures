Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts suggest Adam may be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student.

The traits of empathy, warmth, love of animals and nature appreciate are less stereotypically associated with business administration, so I rated the similarity a bit lower for that field. However, the strong work ethic and dedication mentioned could apply well to business.

These are subjective assessments based on limited information. Adam's actual similarity to students in each field would depend on many other factors not covered in the brief sketch provided.
