Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's love of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His curiosity about nature and plants is also compatible with scientific interests.

While he has an appreciation for hard work and dedication which would serve him well in business administration, his quiet nature and love of animals and puzzles seem less aligned with the typical personality traits for that field. So I rated the similarity a bit lower for business administration.
