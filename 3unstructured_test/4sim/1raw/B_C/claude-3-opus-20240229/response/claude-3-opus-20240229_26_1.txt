Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His warm heart and empathy are less typical of this field.

Business administration seems like it may be a poorer fit. While Adam's strong work ethic would serve him well, his quiet demeanor and love of nature and animals are less aligned with the stereotypical business student profile.
