Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong analytical skills, ability to understand abstract concepts, and intelligence would align well with a typical computer science graduate student. His curiosity and puzzle-solving interest also fit that profile.

The personality sketch doesn't highlight traits that are as characteristic of business administration, such as competitiveness, assertiveness, or persuasive ability. His quiet nature and focus on hard work and dedication could fit with business admin to some degree, but overall the profile is less typical of that field compared to computer science, in my estimation.
