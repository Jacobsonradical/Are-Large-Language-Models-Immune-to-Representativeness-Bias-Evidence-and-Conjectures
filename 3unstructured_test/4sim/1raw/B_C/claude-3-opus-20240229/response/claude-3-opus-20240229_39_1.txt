Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts and problem-solving suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His empathy and love of nature are less typical for that field.

Business administration seems like it may be a poorer fit. While his intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication are relevant, the personality sketch doesn't highlight other common traits for that field like interpersonal skills, leadership, or interest in business topics.

Of course, any individual can excel in a variety of fields. This is just my estimate based on comparing Adam's described personality traits to general stereotypes of students in those graduate programs. Ultimately, fitness depends on the individual.
