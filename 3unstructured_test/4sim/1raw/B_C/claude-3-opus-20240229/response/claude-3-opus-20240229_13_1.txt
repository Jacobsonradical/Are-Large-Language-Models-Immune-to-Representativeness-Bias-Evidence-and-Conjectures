Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be quite similar to a typical computer science grad student. His personality seems less aligned with the typical profile of a business administration student, though his strong work ethic and dedication are relevant traits for that field.
