Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts and problem solving seem to align well with a typical computer science graduate student. His empathy, love of nature and animals seem less directly relevant to computer science.

Business administration graduate students also tend to be intelligent problem solvers, but perhaps with more emphasis on leadership, communication and applied skills rather than abstract reasoning. Adam's personality profile provides less evidence of similarity to a typical MBA student.

Of course, this is a very rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypes. Individuals can certainly deviate from the typical profile in their field. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on the reasoning behind my assessments.
