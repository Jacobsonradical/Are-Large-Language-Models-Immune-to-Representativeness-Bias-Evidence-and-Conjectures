Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His personality seems less similar to a typical business administration student, though his understanding of hard work and dedication is relevant to that field.
