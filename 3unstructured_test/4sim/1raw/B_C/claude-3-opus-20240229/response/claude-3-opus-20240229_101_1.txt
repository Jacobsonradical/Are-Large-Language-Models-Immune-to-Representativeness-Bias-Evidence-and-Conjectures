Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with computer science. His quiet nature and love of solving puzzles also seem to align more with a typical computer science graduate student.

While he may share some traits with business administration students like intelligence and hard work, overall the personality sketch paints a picture of someone more technically and analytically inclined rather than oriented towards management, leadership, and extroversion that is more commonly associated with business administration. So I rated the similarity lower for that field.
