Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with a typical computer science graduate student.

The traits of a warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals seem less typical of a business administration student. However, the appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to graduate students in many fields including business.
