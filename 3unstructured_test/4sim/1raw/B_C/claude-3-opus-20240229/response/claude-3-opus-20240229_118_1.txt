Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts and problem-solving seem to align well with traits common among computer science graduate students. His empathy, love of nature and animals seem less typical for that field.

Business administration graduate students also tend to be intelligent and hard-working, but Adam's profile emphasizes traits like curiosity and abstract thinking more than interpersonal and leadership skills often associated with business. His introversion and interests also seem less aligned with business administration.

Of course, there is a wide range of individuals in any field. This is just my rough estimate based on the limited information provided about Adam and typical traits associated with students in those disciplines. Many other factors beyond this brief sketch would determine his actual fit and similarity to students in a given field.
