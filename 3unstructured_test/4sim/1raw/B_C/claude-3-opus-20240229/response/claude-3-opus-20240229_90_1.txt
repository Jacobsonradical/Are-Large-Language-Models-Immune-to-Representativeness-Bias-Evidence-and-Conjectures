Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's quiet nature, curiosity, puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts seem more aligned with a typical computer science graduate student. His warm heart, empathy and love of animals seem less typical for business administration, which is a more competitive, profits-focused field. However, his appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to both fields to some degree.
