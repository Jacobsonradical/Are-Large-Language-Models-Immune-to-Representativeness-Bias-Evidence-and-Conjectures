Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has traits more typically associated with computer science, such as a curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts. Business administration students may be less likely to have a deep love for animals or strong empathy. However, dedication and hard work are important in both fields. So while Adam's profile seems more aligned with computer science overall, he also has some traits relevant to business administration.
