Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills seem well-aligned with computer science. His personality traits seem less typical of business administration, though his appreciation for hard work and dedication would serve him well in any field.
