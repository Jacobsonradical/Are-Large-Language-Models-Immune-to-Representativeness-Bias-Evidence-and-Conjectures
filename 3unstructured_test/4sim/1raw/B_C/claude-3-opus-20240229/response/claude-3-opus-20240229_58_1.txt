Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles suggests he would be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His empathy and warm heart are less directly relevant to computer science.

While he has an appreciation for hard work and dedication which is important in business, the personality sketch overall paints a picture less similar to a typical MBA student. His love of nature, animals and abstract concepts seems less aligned with common business student profiles.
