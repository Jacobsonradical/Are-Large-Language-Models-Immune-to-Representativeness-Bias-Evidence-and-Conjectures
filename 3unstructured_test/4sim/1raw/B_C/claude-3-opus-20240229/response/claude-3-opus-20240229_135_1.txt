Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's quiet nature, curiosity, puzzle-solving skills, abstract thinking abilities and intelligence align well with traits often found in computer science students. His empathy and love of animals seem less typical for that field.

While he has an appreciation for hard work which could suit business administration, his overall profile seems to fit computer science significantly better based on the personality description provided. Of course, this is a generalization based on limited information.
