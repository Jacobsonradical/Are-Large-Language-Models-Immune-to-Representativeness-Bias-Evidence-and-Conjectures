Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His empathy and love of nature and animals seem less directly relevant to business administration, though his appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to both fields.
