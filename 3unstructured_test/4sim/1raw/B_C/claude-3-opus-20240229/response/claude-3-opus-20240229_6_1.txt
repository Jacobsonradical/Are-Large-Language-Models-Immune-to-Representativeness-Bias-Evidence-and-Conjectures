Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with a typical computer science graduate student. His quiet nature and love of solving puzzles also fit this profile. While he has an appreciation for hard work which could suit business administration, his overall personality seems more aligned with computer science based on the details provided.
