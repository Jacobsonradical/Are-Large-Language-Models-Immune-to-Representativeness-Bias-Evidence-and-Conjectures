Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could align well with computer science. His quiet nature and love of solving puzzles also seem to fit the stereotypical computer science student.

While he may have some relevant traits for business administration like intelligence and work ethic, overall his personality seems less typical of an MBA student. His introversion and interests in nature, animals, and puzzles don't align as closely with common perceptions of business students.

Of course, there is a lot of diversity within any field. This is just my subjective estimate based on the limited information provided and typical stereotypes of each field, which may not always be accurate. Adam could potentially thrive in either area depending on his specific skills, interests and goals.
