Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His warm heart, empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication are positive qualities but seem less directly relevant to typical computer science work.

Business administration seems like it may be a less strong fit given the details provided. Adam's intelligence and problem solving skills would be assets, but the sketch doesn't highlight interpersonal skills, leadership, or interest in business topics that are often associated with business administration.

Of course, this is a simplified assessment based on limited information. Many factors beyond these personality traits would influence fit and success in a graduate program.
