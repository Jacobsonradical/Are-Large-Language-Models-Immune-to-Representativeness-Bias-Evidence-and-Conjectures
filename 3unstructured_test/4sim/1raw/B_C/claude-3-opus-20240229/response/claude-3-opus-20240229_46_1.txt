Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts align well with a typical computer science graduate student profile. However, the strong empathy and love of animals is less typical, so I did not give a rating of 1.

For business administration, qualities like hard work and dedication are relevant. But overall, the profile seems less aligned with a typical business administration graduate student compared to computer science. Problem-solving skills could apply to both. But the strong empathy, love of animals and nature is less typical for business administration.
