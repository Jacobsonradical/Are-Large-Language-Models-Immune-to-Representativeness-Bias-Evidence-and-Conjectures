Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His empathy and love of nature seem less directly relevant to CS.

Business administration seems like it may be less of a natural fit given the personality description. Adam's intelligence would serve him well, but warm-heartedness and love of animals and nature aren't as strongly associated with stereotypical business students. His quiet demeanor and abstract thinking also differ somewhat from the average MBA student profile.

Of course, a wide variety of personalities can succeed in any field. This is just my rough estimate based on the limited information provided and typical graduate student profiles in these fields. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on the reasoning behind my assessments.
