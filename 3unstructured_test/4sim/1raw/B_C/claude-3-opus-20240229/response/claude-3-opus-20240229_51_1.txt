Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong analytical skills, ability to understand abstract concepts, and intelligence suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His curiosity, problem-solving skills, and dedication are also qualities that align well with this field.

While he may have some relevant skills for business administration like intelligence and hard work, overall his personality seems less aligned with the typical traits of business graduate students. His quiet nature and love of animals and nature are less directly relevant to business compared to computer science.
