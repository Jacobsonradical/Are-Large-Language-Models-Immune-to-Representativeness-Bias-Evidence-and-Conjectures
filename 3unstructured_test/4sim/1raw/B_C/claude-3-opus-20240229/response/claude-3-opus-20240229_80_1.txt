Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong analytical skills, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving abilities suggest he would be a good fit for computer science. His curiosity, intelligence and dedication also align well with graduate studies in that field. 

Business administration seems less well-suited to his personality and interests based on the description provided. While he is hardworking, empathetic and intelligent which could serve him well in business, his introversion and love of nature, animals and puzzles don't seem to match as closely with the typical profile of an MBA student.

Of course, this is just an estimate based on limited information. Many different personalities can thrive in any field. But based solely on the sketch provided, computer science appears to be a significantly closer match for Adam than business administration, in my assessment.
