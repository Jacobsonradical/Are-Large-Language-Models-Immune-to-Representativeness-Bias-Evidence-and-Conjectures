Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, puzzle-solving skills, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His empathy and love of nature and animals seem less directly relevant to that field.

Business administration graduate students can certainly be empathetic animal lovers as well. But overall, the personality sketch focuses more on traits that align with computer science than business. Of course, this is a very rough estimate based on limited information about Adam and stereotypes about each field.
