Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with a typical computer science graduate student. His puzzle-solving skills also fit this field. However, his personality traits seem less aligned with a typical business administration student, who may be more outgoing and less focused on abstract concepts or love of nature and animals. Of course, there is variation within any field.
