Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His empathy and warm heart are less directly relevant to the field.

For business administration, Adam's strong work ethic and dedication are relevant traits. However, the personality sketch doesn't highlight leadership, communication, or quantitative skills that are important in business. His quiet nature and love of animals and plants also seem less aligned with typical business students.

Of course, any individual can succeed in a variety of fields. This is just my estimate based on how Adam's described personality traits match the stereotypical graduate student in each area. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on the reasoning behind these similarity scores.
