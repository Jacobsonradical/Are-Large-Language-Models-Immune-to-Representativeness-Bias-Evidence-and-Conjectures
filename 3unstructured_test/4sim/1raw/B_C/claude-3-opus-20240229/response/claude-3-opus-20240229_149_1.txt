Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with computer science. His quiet nature and interest in solving puzzles also seems compatible with this field. 

Business administration seems like it may be less of a natural fit given the personality description. While Adam's intelligence and work ethic would serve him well, the sketch doesn't highlight interpersonal skills, assertiveness, or interest in business topics that are often associated with that field.

Of course, this is a very rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypes. Individuals can certainly succeed in and enjoy fields that may not match their personality perfectly. But based strictly on the details provided, computer science seems more closely aligned with Adam's nature and interests compared to business administration.
