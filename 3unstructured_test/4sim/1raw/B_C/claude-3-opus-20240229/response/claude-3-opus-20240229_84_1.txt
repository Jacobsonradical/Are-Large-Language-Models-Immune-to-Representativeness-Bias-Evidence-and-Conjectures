Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with a typical computer science graduate student. His personality seems less similar to a typical business administration student, though his empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication would serve him well in that field too.
