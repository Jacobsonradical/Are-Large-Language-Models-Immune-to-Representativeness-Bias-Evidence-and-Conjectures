Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he would be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His qualities of curiosity, empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit well in that field.

He seems somewhat less similar to a typical business administration student. While his intelligence and work ethic would serve him well there, the sketch emphasizes more his love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking rather than an interest in management, finance, marketing or other common business topics. So I rated the similarity a bit lower for that field.
