Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His empathy and love of nature and animals are less typical for that field.

Business administration seems like it may be a poorer fit. While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant, his quiet nature and interests in puzzles, nature and animals are less aligned with stereotypical business students.

Of course, any individual can excel in a variety of fields. This is just my estimate based on limited information and typical graduate student profiles in those fields. Adam's unique combination of traits would allow him to bring valuable perspectives to either area of study.
