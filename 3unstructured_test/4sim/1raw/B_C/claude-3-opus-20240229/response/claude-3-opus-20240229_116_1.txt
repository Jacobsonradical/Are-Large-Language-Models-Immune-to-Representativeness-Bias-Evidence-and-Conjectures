Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong analytical skills, ability to understand abstract concepts, and intelligence would make him a good fit for computer science. His curiosity and puzzle-solving nature also align well with this field.

Business administration is less of a natural fit given his personality. While his dedication and work ethic would serve him well, the sketch suggests he is more oriented towards intellectual pursuits than practical business applications. His quiet nature may also be less of a match for the interpersonal demands of business.

Of course, there is individual variation within any field. But based solely on the personality description provided, computer science seems to be the closer match for Adam between these two graduate programs.
