Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could align well with computer science. His quiet nature and love of solving puzzles also seem to fit the stereotypical computer science student.

While he may share some traits with business students like intelligence and hard work, his empathy, warm heart and love of nature and animals seem less typical of business administration students, who are often imagined as more competitive and profit-driven. Of course, these are generalizations and individual students vary greatly.
