Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His curiosity and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also traits that would serve him well in this field.

Business administration seems like it may be a less strong fit given the details provided. While Adam's intelligence would certainly be an asset, the personality sketch does not mention traits like leadership, competitiveness, assertiveness or extroversion that are common among business students. His quiet nature and love of animals and nature seem less aligned with typical business student profiles.

Of course, this is just a rough assessment based on limited information. Any individual can break the mold of a "typical" student in their field. But based solely on the personality details provided, computer science seems a stronger match for Adam than business administration.
