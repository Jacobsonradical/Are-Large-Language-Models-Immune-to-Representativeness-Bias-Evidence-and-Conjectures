Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong analytical skills, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His curiosity, puzzle-solving inclination, and dedication also align well with this field.

While he may have some relevant skills for business administration like intelligence and a strong work ethic, the personality sketch emphasizes more his empathy, love of nature and animals, and quiet demeanor, which seem less directly applicable to typical business administration students. So I rated the similarity a bit lower for that field.
