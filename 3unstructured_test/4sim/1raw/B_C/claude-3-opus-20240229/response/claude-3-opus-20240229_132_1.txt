Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong analytical skills, ability to understand abstract concepts, intelligence and puzzle-solving interest suggest he may be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His personality traits seem less typical of an MBA student, though his hard work and dedication are relevant. Of course, this is a generalization based on limited information.
