Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could align well with computer science. His quiet nature and enjoyment of solving puzzles also seem to fit the stereotypical computer science student.

While he may share some traits with business students like dedication and intelligence, his strong empathy, love of animals, and curiosity about nature seem less typical for a business administration student, based on common stereotypes. Of course, these are generalizations and individuals in any field can have a diverse range of personalities and interests.
