Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong analytical skills, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the typical profile of a computer science graduate student. His curiosity, puzzle-solving interest, and dedication also fit this field.

While he may share some traits with business administration students like strong work ethic and intelligence, his overall profile seems less aligned with typical students in that field, who may be more outgoing and less focused on abstract problem-solving. However, his empathy and warm heart could be an asset in business roles.

Of course, any individual can be a successful graduate student in various fields. This is just my assessment based on how well Adam's described traits match the stereotypical student in each field, on a scale from 0 to 1.
