Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he would be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His empathy and love of animals are less directly relevant to computer science.

While Adam's strong work ethic would serve him well in business administration, his overall profile seems less well-aligned with that field compared to computer science. His quiet nature and focus on abstract concepts over interpersonal skills suggest he may be less similar to the average MBA student.

Of course, this is a simplified assessment based on limited information. Individuals can certainly thrive in graduate programs even if their personality differs from the average student. But based strictly on the details provided, computer science appears to be a stronger match for Adam than business administration.
