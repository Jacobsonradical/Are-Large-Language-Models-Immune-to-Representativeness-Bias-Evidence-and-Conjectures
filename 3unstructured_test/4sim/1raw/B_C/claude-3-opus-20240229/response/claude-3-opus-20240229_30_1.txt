Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, skill at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he may be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His empathy, love of animals, and curiosity about nature and plants seem less directly relevant to computer science.

For business administration, Adam's appreciation of hard work and dedication could be relevant traits. However, the other details provided about his personality don't strongly align with or against being a business student. His profile overall seems to fit computer science a bit better based on the limited information provided.
