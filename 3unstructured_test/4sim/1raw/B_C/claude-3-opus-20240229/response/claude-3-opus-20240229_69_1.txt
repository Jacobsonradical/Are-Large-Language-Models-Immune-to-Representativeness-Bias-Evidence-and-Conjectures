Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and love of solving puzzles suggest he would be quite similar to a typical computer science grad student. His empathy, love of nature and animals seem less typical for that field.

Business administration students also need to be intelligent and hard-working, so there is some similarity. But Adam's personality seems more aligned with abstract, technical fields rather than business-oriented ones. His reserved nature also seems less similar to business where interpersonal skills are important.

Of course, this is a very rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypes. Individuals can be very different from the "typical" student in their field. But based solely on the sketch provided, computer science seems a more natural fit for Adam than business administration.
