Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with computer science. His quiet nature and enjoyment of solving puzzles also seems compatible with the field. 

Business administration seems like it may be less of a natural fit given the personality description. While Adam's intelligence would serve him well, the sketch doesn't mention strong people skills, competitiveness, or interest in business topics that are common in that field. His empathy and love of animals and nature also seem less directly relevant.

Of course, this is just a high-level assessment based on the limited information provided. Many other factors would influence his fit and success in a particular graduate program.
