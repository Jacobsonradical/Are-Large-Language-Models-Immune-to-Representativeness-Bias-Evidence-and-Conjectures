Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with computer science. His quieter nature and love of solving puzzles also seems compatible with computer science.

Business administration seems like it may be less of a natural fit given his personality profile. While he is intelligent and hard-working, the sketch portrays him as more of an introspective, empathetic puzzle-solver and nature/animal lover rather than an outgoing business leader type.

Of course, there is a wide variety of individuals in any field. But based solely on the limited information provided, computer science seems more closely aligned with his interests and strengths compared to business administration. Let me know if you would like me to explain my reasoning further!
