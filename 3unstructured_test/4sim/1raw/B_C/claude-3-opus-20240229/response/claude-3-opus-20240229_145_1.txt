Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence and understanding abstract concepts seem quite well aligned with a typical computer science graduate student, so I rated the similarity relatively high at 0.7.

The traits of empathy, love of animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication could align with business administration to some degree, but seem less directly relevant than for computer science. So I rated the similarity to a typical business administration graduate student lower at 0.4.
