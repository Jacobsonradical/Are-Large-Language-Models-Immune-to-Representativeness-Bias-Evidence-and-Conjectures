Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and facility with abstract concepts suggest Adam would be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student.

The traits of empathy, love of animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication, while positive attributes, seem less directly relevant to business administration. His quiet nature may also be less of a match for the collaborative and presentation-focused nature of many business programs. So I rated the similarity lower for that field.
