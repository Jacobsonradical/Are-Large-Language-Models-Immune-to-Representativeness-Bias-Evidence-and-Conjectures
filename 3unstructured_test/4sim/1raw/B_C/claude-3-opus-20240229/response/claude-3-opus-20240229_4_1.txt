Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Reasoning:
Business administration: While Adam's strong work ethic and dedication could be a good fit, his deep love of nature, animals, and abstract concepts seems less aligned with the typical business administration student. 

Computer science: Adam's intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggests he would be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His logical thinking style seems well-suited to the field.
