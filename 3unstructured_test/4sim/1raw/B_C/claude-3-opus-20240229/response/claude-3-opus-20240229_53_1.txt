Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with computer science. His quiet nature and love of puzzles also seem to align more with a typical computer science graduate student profile.

While he may share some traits with business administration students like intelligence and work ethic, overall his personality seems less aligned with that field. His introversion and interests in nature, animals, and puzzles don't seem to match as closely with a typical MBA student profile.

Of course, this is a generalization based on limited information. Individuals can certainly deviate from stereotypical profiles for their field. But based solely on the personality sketch provided, computer science seems a notably better match for Adam than business administration.
