Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. However, business administration graduate students also tend to be intelligent and hard-working. Adam's empathy and love of nature and animals seem less typical of graduate students in either field. Overall, he seems somewhat more aligned with a typical computer science graduate student profile than business administration.
