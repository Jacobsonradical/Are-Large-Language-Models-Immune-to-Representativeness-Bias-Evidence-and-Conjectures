Here is my assessment of how similar Adam seems to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's strong analytical skills, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His curiosity and puzzle-solving interest also align with this field.

He seems less similar to a typical business administration student. While his hard work ethic would serve him well, the sketch doesn't mention strong leadership, communication, or management skills that are common in business. His quietness and focus on nature/animals over people also makes him less of a prototypical fit for business administration.

Of course, any individual can break the mold. But based solely on the details provided, computer science seems a more natural fit for Adam than business administration, in my estimation.
