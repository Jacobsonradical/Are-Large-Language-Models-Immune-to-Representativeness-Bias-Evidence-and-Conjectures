Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding abstract concepts seem very aligned with a typical computer science graduate student. The empathy and love of animals are less typical but the overall profile seems a reasonably good match.

Business administration graduate students often have strong work ethic and dedication, but the other traits mentioned like curiosity about nature, empathy, and puzzle solving seem less typical of that field. So I scored the similarity lower for business administration.
