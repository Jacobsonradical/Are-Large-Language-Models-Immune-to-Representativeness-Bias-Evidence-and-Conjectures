Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His curiosity and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also qualities that would serve him well in a computer science graduate program.

He seems less similar to a typical business administration student. While his intelligence would certainly be an asset, the personality sketch doesn't highlight traits like leadership, competitiveness, assertiveness or extroversion that are often associated with business. His quiet nature and love of animals and nature seem less aligned with common perceptions of business school students.

Of course, this is a generalization based on a brief personality sketch. There is much individual variation among graduate students in any field. But in terms of overall similarity to common stereotypes, I estimate Adam is moderately similar to a computer science student and less similar to a business administration student.
