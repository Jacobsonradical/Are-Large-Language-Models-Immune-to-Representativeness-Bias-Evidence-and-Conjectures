Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and aptitude for solving puzzles suggest he may be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His curiosity, empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication could serve him well in business administration, but his overall profile seems to align more closely with computer science based on the details provided.
