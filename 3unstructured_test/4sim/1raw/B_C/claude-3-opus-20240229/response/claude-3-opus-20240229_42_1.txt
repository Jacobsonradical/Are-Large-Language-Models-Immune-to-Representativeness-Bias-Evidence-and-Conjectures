Here is my assessment of how similar Adam seems to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His empathy and warm heart are less directly relevant for CS.

Business administration seems like it may be a weaker fit. While his intelligence and work ethic would serve him well, the personality sketch doesn't highlight traits like leadership, people skills, competitiveness or entrepreneurial spirit that are common in business.

Of course, this is a very rough estimate based on limited information. Many different personalities can succeed in any field. But based strictly on the details provided, computer science seems a bit more aligned with Adam's strengths and interests compared to business.
