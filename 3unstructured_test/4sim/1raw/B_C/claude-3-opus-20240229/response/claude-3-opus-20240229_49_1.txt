Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may have qualities well-suited for computer science. His empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also translate to business, but the overall profile seems to align somewhat more closely with a typical computer science graduate student.
