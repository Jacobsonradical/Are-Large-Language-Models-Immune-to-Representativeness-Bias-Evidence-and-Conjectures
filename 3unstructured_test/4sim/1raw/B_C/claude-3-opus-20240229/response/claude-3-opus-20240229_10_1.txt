Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he may be quite similar to many computer science graduate students. His curiosity and analytical mindset seem well-suited for that field.

He seems less similar to a typical business administration student, as the sketch doesn't mention traits like leadership, competitiveness, or extroversion that are common in that field. However, his appreciation for hard work and dedication would serve him well in business. Overall, the fit seems less strong than for computer science based on the limited information provided.
