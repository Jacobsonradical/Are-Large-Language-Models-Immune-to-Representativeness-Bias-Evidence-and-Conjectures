Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could align well with computer science. Problem solving and puzzle solving skills are also very relevant for computer science.

The personality sketch provides less evidence of traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership drive, competitiveness, extroversion, or interest in finance and management. So I rated the similarity lower for that field. Of course, this is just a rough estimate based on the limited information provided about Adam.
