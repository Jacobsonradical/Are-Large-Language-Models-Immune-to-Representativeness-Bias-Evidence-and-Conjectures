Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His empathy and love of nature and animals seem less directly relevant to business administration, though his understanding of hard work and dedication could apply to both fields.
