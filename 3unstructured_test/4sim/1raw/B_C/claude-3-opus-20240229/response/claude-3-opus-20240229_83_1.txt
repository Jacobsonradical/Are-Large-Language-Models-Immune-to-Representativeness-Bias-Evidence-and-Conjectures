Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has traits that would fit well with computer science, such as a curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts. However, it doesn't mention technical skills or interest in technology.

For business administration, the description of Adam having a strong work ethic and dedication could be relevant. But overall, the personality sketch focuses more on traits related to science and nature rather than business. So I rated the similarity lower for business administration.
