Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts suggest Adam may be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. The empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are less directly relevant.

Business administration is a very broad field. Some traits like intelligence and hard work are certainly relevant. But overall, the personality sketch provides less evidence of strong similarity to a typical MBA student compared to computer science. Traits like interpersonal skills, leadership, ambition and interest in organizations and business are not mentioned.

Of course, this is a very rough assessment based on limited information about Adam and broad generalizations about each field. Graduate students in any discipline vary considerably. But based solely on the personality sketch provided, computer science seems a somewhat better match than business administration.
