Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with computer science. His quiet nature and interest in puzzles also seems compatible with this field.

Business administration seems like it may be less of a natural fit given his personality. While he is intelligent and appreciates hard work, traits like a quiet nature, strong empathy and love of animals are less directly relevant to typical business pursuits. His profile reads more like someone drawn to scientific and technical fields rather than business.

Of course, there is a wide variety of people in every field. This is just my subjective estimate based on the limited information provided about how Adam compares to the average graduate student in each area of study.
