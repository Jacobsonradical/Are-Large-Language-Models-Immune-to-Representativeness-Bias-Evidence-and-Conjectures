Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. However, business administration graduate students also need analytical skills and intelligence.

His empathy, love of animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication seem less directly relevant to either field. More details about his specific interests and skills would help determine which field might be the best match for him.
