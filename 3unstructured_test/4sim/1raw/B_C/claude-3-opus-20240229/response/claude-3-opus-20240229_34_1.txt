Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest Adam may be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are positive traits that could apply in many fields. However, the sketch does not mention business-related interests, drive, or leadership skills that might be more common among business administration students. Of course, this is a very rough estimate based on limited information. Individuals can certainly succeed in a variety of fields regardless of their personality traits.
