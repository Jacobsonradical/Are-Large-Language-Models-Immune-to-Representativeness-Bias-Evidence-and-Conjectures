Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong analytical thinking skills, ability to understand abstract concepts, and dedication would align well with computer science. His personality traits seem less typical of business administration, which tends to attract more extroverted and people-oriented individuals, although his intelligence would serve him well in either field.
