Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His empathy and love of nature and animals are less typical for that field.

Business administration seems like it may be a poorer fit. While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant, his quiet demeanor and interests in puzzles, nature and animals are less aligned with the typical business administration student profile.
