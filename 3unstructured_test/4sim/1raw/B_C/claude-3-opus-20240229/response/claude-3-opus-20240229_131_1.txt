Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align well with traits common among computer science graduate students. His quiet nature and love of solving puzzles also fit this profile. 

While he has an appreciation for hard work and dedication which is important in business, traits like strong empathy and a deep love of animals are less typical of business administration graduate students. His overall profile seems less aligned with that field.
