Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with computer science. His quietness and love of puzzles also seem compatible with the field.

Business administration seems like it could be a less natural fit based on the personality sketch. While Adam's intelligence and work ethic would serve him well, the sketch doesn't highlight interpersonal skills, competitiveness, or interest in business topics that are common in that field. He may be more similar to a typical CS graduate student.
