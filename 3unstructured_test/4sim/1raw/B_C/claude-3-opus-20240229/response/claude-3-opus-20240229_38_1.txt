Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. However, his personality sketch does not mention specific technical skills or interest in technology.

Business administration seems like it may be a less close fit, as the personality sketch does not mention leadership skills, entrepreneurial drive, or extroverted qualities that are common in that field. However, Adam's understanding of hard work and dedication could serve him well in business.
