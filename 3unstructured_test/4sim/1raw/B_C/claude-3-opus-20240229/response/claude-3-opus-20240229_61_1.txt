Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with a typical computer science graduate student. His quiet nature and interest in solving puzzles also seem to fit that profile.

While he has an appreciation for hard work and dedication which is important in business, his overall personality seems less aligned with a typical MBA student. His introversion and deep love of animals and nature are less typical traits for business administration.

Of course, any individual can deviate from the average personality profile in a field. But based solely on the brief description provided, computer science seems a stronger match for Adam than business administration does.
