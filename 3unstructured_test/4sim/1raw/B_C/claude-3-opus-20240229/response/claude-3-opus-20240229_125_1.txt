Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong interest in nature, curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with a typical computer science graduate student than a business administration student. However, his empathy, warm heart and strong work ethic could lend themselves to either field to some degree.
