Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong analytical skills, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the typical profile of a computer science graduate student. His curiosity, puzzle-solving abilities, and dedication also fit this field.

Business administration seems less aligned with his personality profile, as the sketch doesn't mention interests or skills commonly associated with that field such as leadership, competitiveness, extroversion or risk-taking. However, his intelligence and work ethic would still serve him reasonably well in business.
