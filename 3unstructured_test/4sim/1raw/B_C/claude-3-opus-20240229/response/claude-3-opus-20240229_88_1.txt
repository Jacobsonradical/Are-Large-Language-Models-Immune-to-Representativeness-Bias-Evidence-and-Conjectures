Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His curiosity and analytical skills could serve him well in that field.

He seems less similar to a typical business administration student. While his strong work ethic and dedication are assets, the personality sketch doesn't mention interest in topics like management, finance, or entrepreneurship that are common among business students. His quiet nature and love of animals and nature also don't align as closely with stereotypical traits of business majors.

Of course, there is a wide range of individual variation within any field. But based solely on the limited information provided, computer science seems a bit more fitting for Adam than business administration, in my estimation. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on my reasoning further.
