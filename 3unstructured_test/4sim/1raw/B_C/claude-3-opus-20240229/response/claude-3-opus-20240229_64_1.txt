Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts align well with a typical computer science graduate student.  However, the description of Adam as having strong empathy and a deep love of animals is less typical of computer science students compared to some other fields.

For business administration, problem-solving skills and dedication are relevant traits. However, the overall profile seems less well aligned with a typical MBA student. Traits like extroversion, competitiveness, and leadership orientation are not mentioned.

Of course, any individual can be suited for a field even if not matching the average profile. This assessment is based solely on the brief description provided and represents my best estimate based on typical characteristics of graduate students in these fields.
