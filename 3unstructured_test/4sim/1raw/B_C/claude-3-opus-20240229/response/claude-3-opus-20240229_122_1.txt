Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong analytical skills, ability to understand abstract concepts, and intelligence suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His curiosity, puzzle-solving interest, and dedication also align well with this field.

While he has an appreciation for hard work which is important in business, the personality sketch overall seems less aligned with a typical business administration student. His empathy, love of animals and nature point to interests that may not be as central to business administration.

Of course, this is a subjective estimate based on limited information. Any individual can be a fit for various fields depending on their specific interests, skills and goals.
