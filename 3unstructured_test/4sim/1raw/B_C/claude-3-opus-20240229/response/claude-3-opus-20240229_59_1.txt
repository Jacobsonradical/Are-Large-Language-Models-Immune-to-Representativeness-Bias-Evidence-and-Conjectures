Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His warm heart and empathy are less directly relevant to the field.

The personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be similar to a typical graduate student in business administration. His appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant. But overall, the description paints a picture of someone more oriented toward abstract problem-solving than business.

Of course, this is a very rough assessment based on limited information. Many other factors beyond this brief personality sketch would determine how well Adam fits with any particular graduate program.
