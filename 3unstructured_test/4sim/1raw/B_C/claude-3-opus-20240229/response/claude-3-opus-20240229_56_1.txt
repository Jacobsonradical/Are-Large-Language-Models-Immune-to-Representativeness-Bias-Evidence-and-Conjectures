Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with computer science. His quiet nature and love of solving puzzles also seem to align more with a typical computer science graduate student profile.

While he may share some traits with business administration students like intelligence and work ethic, overall the personality sketch paints a picture of someone more aligned with technical and scientific pursuits rather than business. His strong empathy and love of animals and nature don't seem as stereotypical of an average MBA student.

Of course, these are just broad generalizations based on a brief character sketch. There is a wide diversity of individuals and personalities across all fields of graduate study.
