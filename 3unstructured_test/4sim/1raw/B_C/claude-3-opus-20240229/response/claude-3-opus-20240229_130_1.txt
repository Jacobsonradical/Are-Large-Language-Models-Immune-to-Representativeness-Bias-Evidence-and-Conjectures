Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts suggest Adam may be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. 

The traits of empathy, warm-heartedness and appreciation of hard work and dedication could apply to many fields. They seem less directly relevant to business administration in particular compared to computer science. So I rated the similarity lower for business administration.
