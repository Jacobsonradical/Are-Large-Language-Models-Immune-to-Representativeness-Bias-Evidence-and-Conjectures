Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong abstract thinking skills, intelligence and puzzle-solving interests align well with a typical computer science graduate student profile. His curiosity, empathy and love of nature and animals seem less directly relevant to business administration, though his appreciation for hard work and dedication could serve him well in either field.
