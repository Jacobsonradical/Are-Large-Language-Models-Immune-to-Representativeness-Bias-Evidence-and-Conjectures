Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. However, his strong empathy and love of nature and animals are less typical of computer science students.

Business administration seems less aligned with Adam's personality and interests based on the description provided. While he appreciates hard work and dedication, the sketch does not mention business acumen, leadership, or extroverted qualities that are more common in business students.
