Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, puzzles and abstract concepts suggests he may be more aligned with a technical field like computer science rather than business administration. His intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could suit either field, but overall the personality sketch paints a picture more typical of computer science than business in my estimation.
