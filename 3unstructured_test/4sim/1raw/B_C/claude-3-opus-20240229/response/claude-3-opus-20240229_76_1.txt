Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could suit him well for graduate studies in either field. However, his quiet nature, love of solving puzzles, and deep interest in nature and animals seem to align more closely with a typical computer science graduate student profile than a business administration one. Of course, there is a lot of individual variation and many other factors that influence graduate school fit beyond just these personality traits.
