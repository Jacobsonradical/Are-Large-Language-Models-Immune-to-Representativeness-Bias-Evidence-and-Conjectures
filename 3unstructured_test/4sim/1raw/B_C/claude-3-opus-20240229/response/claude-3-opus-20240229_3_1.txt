Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has a strong curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, which aligns well with a typical computer science graduate student. His quiet nature and love of solving puzzles also seem to fit that profile.

While he has an appreciation for hard work and dedication which could fit with business administration, overall his personality seems less aligned with a typical MBA student. His empathy, love of animals and nature suggest interests that may not be as common in business school.

Of course, this is a generalization based on a brief sketch. Any individual could be well-suited to either field regardless of personality. But based solely on the details provided, I estimate Adam is more similar to a typical computer science graduate student.
