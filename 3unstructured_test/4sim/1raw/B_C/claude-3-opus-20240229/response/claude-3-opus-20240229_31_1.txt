Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he would be a good fit for computer science. His personality seems less suited for business administration, which often requires more extroversion and competitive drive.
