Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with either field. However, his quiet nature, love of solving puzzles, and deep empathy and love for animals seem to align more closely with typical traits of computer science graduate students compared to business administration students. Of course, this is a generalization and individuals in any field can have a wide range of personalities and interests.
