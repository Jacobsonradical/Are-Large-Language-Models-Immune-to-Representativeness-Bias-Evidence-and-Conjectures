Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's love of problem solving, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggests he may be a good fit for computer science. His curiosity, empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant in business as well, but the overall profile seems more aligned with a typical computer science graduate student.
