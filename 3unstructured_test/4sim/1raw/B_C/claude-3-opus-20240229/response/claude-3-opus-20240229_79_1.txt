Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's quiet nature, curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align more closely with traits often found in computer science graduate students. His strong empathy and love of animals are less typical for that field. Business administration graduate students often need strong interpersonal skills and an interest in organizations and leadership, which are not highlighted in Adam's profile. However, his appreciation for hard work and dedication could serve him well in either field.
