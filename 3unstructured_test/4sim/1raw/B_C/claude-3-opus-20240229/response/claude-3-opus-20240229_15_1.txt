Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity, aptitude for problem-solving, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the typical profile of a computer science graduate student. His warm heart, strong empathy and love of animals are less directly relevant to computer science.

While Adam's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could serve him well in business administration, his overall personality profile seems less aligned with the typical business administration graduate student. His quietness and interests in nature, puzzles and animals don't match the stereotypical extroverted, networking-focused business student.

Of course, there is a wide range of individual variation within any field. This assessment is based solely on the limited information provided about Adam and represents a generalization about typical graduate student profiles in these fields.
