Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with traits often found in computer science students. His puzzle-solving skills also fit that field. He seems less similar to a typical business administration student based on the description, though his appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant there.
