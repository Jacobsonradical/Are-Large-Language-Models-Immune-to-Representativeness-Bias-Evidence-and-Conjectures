Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with computer science. His quiet nature and enjoyment of solving puzzles also seems compatible with computer science.

While he may have some relevant traits like intelligence and work ethic, overall his empathetic nature, love of animals, and interest in nature and plants seems less typical of a business administration student based on common stereotypes of that field.
