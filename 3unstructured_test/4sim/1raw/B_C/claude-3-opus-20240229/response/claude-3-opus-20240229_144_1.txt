Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills seem well-aligned with computer science. His empathy, love of animals, and appreciation of nature seem less typical of business administration, which is more focused on management, finance, and organizational skills. Of course, any individual can be suited for a variety of fields regardless of stereotypes. But based solely on the personality sketch provided, computer science seems a stronger match for Adam than business administration.
