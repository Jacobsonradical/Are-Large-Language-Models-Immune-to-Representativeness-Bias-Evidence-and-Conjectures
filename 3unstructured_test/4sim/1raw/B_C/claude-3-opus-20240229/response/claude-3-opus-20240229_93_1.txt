Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, strong analytical skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest Adam may be a good fit for computer science. However, the sketch doesn't mention specific technical skills or interest in technology.

For business administration, traits like hard work, dedication and intelligence are relevant. But the overall profile seems less suited to a typical business student, lacking mention of leadership, competitiveness, extroversion or interest in finance and management.

Of course, this is a very rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypes. Individuals can certainly succeed in fields even if differing from the "typical" student. Let me know if you would like me to explain my reasoning further.
