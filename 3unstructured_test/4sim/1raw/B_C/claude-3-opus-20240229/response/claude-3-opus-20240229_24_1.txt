Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking ability, and puzzle-solving skills seem very well aligned with a typical computer science graduate student. His empathy and love of animals are less directly relevant to computer science.

Business administration relies more on interpersonal skills, leadership, and practical application. While Adam's intelligence and work ethic would serve him well, his quiet nature and focus on abstract concepts over people suggest he may be less similar to a typical MBA student. Of course, there is diversity in every field.
