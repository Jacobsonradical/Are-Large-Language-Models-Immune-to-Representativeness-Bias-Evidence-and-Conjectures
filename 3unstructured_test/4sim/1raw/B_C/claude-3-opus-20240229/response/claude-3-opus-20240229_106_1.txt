Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong analytical skills, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His curiosity, puzzle-solving interest, and dedication also align well with traits common in computer science students.

While he is intelligent and hardworking which would serve him well in business administration, his quieter nature, love of animals, and curiosity about plants suggest his personality and interests may not be as strong of a match for a typical business administration student profile. However, there is certainly still potential for him to succeed in that field.
