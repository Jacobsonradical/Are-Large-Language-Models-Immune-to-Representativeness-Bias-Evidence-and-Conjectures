Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's strong curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he would be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His empathy and love of nature and animals are less directly relevant to computer science.

Business administration graduate students also tend to be intelligent and hard-working, but emphatic people skills are more important in that field. Adam's quiet demeanor and abstract thinking suggest he may be somewhat less similar to a typical MBA student. Of course, there is a wide range of personalities in any field.
