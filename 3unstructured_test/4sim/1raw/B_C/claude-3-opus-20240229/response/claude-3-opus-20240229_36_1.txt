Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His empathy and love of nature and animals seem less directly relevant to computer science.

For business administration, Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be assets. However, the personality sketch doesn't highlight entrepreneurial drive, leadership, or interpersonal skills that are important in business. His quiet demeanor and interests in puzzles and nature also don't seem to align as strongly with typical business students.

Of course, this is a very rough assessment based on limited information. Many other factors beyond this brief personality sketch would determine how well Adam fits with and performs in a particular graduate program. But I hope this gives a directional sense of his similarities to typical student profiles in these fields.
