Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and being good at understanding abstract concepts seem quite well-aligned with a typical computer science graduate student. Problem solving skills also fit that profile well.

The traits seem less well-aligned with a typical business administration student. While intelligence, hard work and abstract thinking are certainly relevant, the strong empathy, love of animals, and quiet demeanor are less stereotypical of business students. Of course, these are generalizations and individuals can vary significantly from the norm for their field.
