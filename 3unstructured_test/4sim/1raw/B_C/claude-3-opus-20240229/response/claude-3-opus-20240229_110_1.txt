Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His love of nature, animals and strong empathy are less directly relevant to computer science.

Business administration seems like it may be a less natural fit based on the personality description provided. While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant, many other key traits for business, like strong communication skills, competitiveness, and extroversion, are not mentioned.

Of course, this is a subjective assessment based on limited information. Aptitude for any field depends on many factors beyond just personality traits. But based solely on what was provided, computer science seems a bit more aligned with Adam's strengths and interests compared to business administration.
