Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. However, business administration graduate students also tend to be intelligent and hard-working, so there is some similarity there as well, though perhaps not quite as strong of a match given Adam's other traits and interests.
