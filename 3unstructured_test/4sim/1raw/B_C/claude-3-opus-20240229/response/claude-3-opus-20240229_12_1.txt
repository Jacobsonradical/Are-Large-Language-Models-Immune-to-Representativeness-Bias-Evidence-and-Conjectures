Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are positive qualities but less directly relevant to the technical skills needed for computer science.

Business administration seems like it may be a less natural fit based on the personality description provided. While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work would serve him well, the sketch doesn't highlight interpersonal skills, leadership drive, or interest in business topics that are common among business graduate students. His quiet nature and love of animals and plants also seem less aligned with typical business student profiles.

Of course, this is a very rough assessment based on limited information. Many other factors beyond this brief sketch would determine Adam's fit and success in any graduate program.
