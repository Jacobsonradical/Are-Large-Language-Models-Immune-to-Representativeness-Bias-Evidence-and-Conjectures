Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he would be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His empathy and love of animals are less directly relevant to computer science.

Business administration requires dedication and hard work which Adam seems to appreciate. However, his overall profile with a focus on nature, animals, and abstract thinking seems less aligned with the typical business administration student, compared to computer science.
