Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills align well with a typical computer science graduate student. His empathy and love of nature and animals are less typical for that field.

His personality traits seem less aligned with a typical business administration student. While his intelligence and work ethic would serve him well, business students tend to be more extroverted and less focused on abstract concepts compared to the description of Adam.
