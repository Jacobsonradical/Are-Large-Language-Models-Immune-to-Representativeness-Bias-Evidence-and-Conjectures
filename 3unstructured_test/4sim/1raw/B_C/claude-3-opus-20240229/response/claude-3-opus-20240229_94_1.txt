Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he would be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His empathy, love of nature and animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit well in that field, though are perhaps less central.

While he may share an appreciation for hard work with typical business administration students, his overall profile seems less well aligned with that field. His abstract thinking style and personal qualities seem more oriented towards computer science. Of course, additional details about his specific skills and professional interests would help further assess fit.
