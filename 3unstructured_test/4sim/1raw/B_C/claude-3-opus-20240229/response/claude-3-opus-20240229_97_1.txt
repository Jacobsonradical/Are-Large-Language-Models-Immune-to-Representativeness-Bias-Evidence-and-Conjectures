Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles align fairly well with typical traits of computer science graduate students. However, the strong empathy, love of animals and nature is less typical, so I did not give a higher score than 0.7.

For business administration, traits like hard work, dedication and intelligence would fit. But the overall profile seems less aligned with typical business students compared to computer science. The introversion, abstract thinking, and interests in puzzles, animals and nature are less characteristic of business students in my estimation. So I gave a lower score of 0.4.
