Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His warmth, empathy and love of animals are less directly relevant to the typical profile of a computer science grad student.

While he has an appreciation for hard work which could suit business administration, overall his profile seems less well aligned with the typical traits and interests seen in business graduate students compared to computer science. His quietness and focus on understanding nature and solving puzzles fits the computer science profile more closely in my estimation.
