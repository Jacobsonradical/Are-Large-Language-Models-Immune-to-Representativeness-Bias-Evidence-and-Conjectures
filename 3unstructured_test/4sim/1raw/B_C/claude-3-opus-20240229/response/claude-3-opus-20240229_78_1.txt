Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong empathy, love of animals, and quiet personality solving puzzles seem less typical of business administration students. His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and curiosity about nature align more closely with traits of many computer science graduate students.
