Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with a typical computer science graduate student profile. The empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are positive qualities but less directly relevant to computer science.

Business administration also requires intelligence and hard work, but the other traits mentioned like curiosity about plants, empathy, and love of animals are less typical of an MBA student profile compared to computer science. Problem-solving is relevant but business focuses more on practical rather than abstract concepts.

This is my best estimate based on the information provided, but a fuller profile would allow for a more precise assessment. The values are not definitive but reflect relative similarity to typical graduate student profiles in those fields.
