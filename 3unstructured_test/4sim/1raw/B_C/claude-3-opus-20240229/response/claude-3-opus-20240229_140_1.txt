Here is my assessment of how similar Adam seems to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. However, business administration also requires dedication and hard work, so he has some similarities there too, though the overall profile seems less aligned with a typical business student.
