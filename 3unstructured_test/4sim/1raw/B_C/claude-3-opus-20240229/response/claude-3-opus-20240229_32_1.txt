Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. However, business administration graduate students also tend to be intelligent and hard-working. Adam's warm heart, strong empathy and love of nature and animals seem less directly relevant to either field. Of course, this is a very rough estimate based on limited information about Adam and broad stereotypes about each field. Many additional factors would determine his actual fit and success as a graduate student.
