Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong analytical skills, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the typical profile of a computer science graduate student. His curiosity, puzzle-solving interest, and dedication also fit this field.

However, his personality seems less aligned with the typical profile of a business administration student. While his intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant, traits like empathy, love of animals, and quiet nature are less emphasized in this field compared to skills like assertiveness, competitiveness, and extraversion.

Of course, there is diversity of personalities within any field. But based on the sketch provided, computer science seems a notably better match for Adam than business administration.
