Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles suggests he may be a good fit for computer science. His empathy and warm heart are positive qualities but less directly relevant for the highly analytical field of CS.

Business administration requires interpersonal skills and dedication which Adam seems to possess. However, the personality sketch doesn't highlight leadership, competitiveness, or interest in business topics that are more typical of MBA students. His overall profile seems less aligned with business administration compared to computer science.
