Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's strong interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His curiosity and analytical skills align well with this field.

He seems less similar to a typical business administration student. While his dedication and work ethic would serve him well, the personality sketch doesn't mention key traits for business such as leadership, communication skills, interest in management, finance or operations. His quiet demeanor and focus on nature, animals and empathy also don't strongly align with stereotypical business student traits.

Of course, any individual can be successful in a variety of fields. This assessment is based solely on limited information from the personality sketch provided, compared against general stereotypes. Adam's actual fit for any graduate program would depend on many other factors.
