Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. However, his personality sketch does not mention technical skills or specific interest in computers or programming.

The description of Adam does not strongly align with typical traits of business administration students, such as leadership drive, extroversion, competitiveness, or interest in management, finance, and business operations. His empathy and love of nature and animals seem less relevant to business.

Of course, this is a very rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypes. Individuals can certainly deviate from typical traits in their field. More specific information about Adam's skills, interests and career goals would be needed for a confident assessment of fit.
