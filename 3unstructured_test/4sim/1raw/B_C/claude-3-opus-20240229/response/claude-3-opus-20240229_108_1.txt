Here is my assessment of how similar Adam seems to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract concepts seem highly compatible with computer science. His empathy and warm heart seem less typical of that field.

Business administration graduate students may have strong work ethic and dedication, but business requires more interpersonal and leadership skills that weren't highlighted in Adam's profile. His thoughtful, abstract nature seems less aligned with the practical, results-driven focus of business.

Of course, any individual can break the mold. But based solely on the personality sketch provided, computer science seems a more natural fit for Adam than business administration, in my estimation.
