Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His curiosity and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also qualities that would serve him well in that field.

He seems less similar to a typical business administration student. While his intelligence would certainly be an asset, the personality sketch does not emphasize traits like assertiveness, competitiveness, or leadership that are often associated with business. His quiet nature and love of animals and nature hint that he may prefer a less corporate environment.

Of course, this is a simplified assessment based on limited information. Individuals can certainly succeed in fields even if their personality does not match the stereotype. But in terms of similarity to the typical graduate student, I estimate Adam is reasonably similar to a computer science student but less so for business administration.
