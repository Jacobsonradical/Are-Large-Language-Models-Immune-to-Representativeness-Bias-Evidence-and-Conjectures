Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong analytical skills, ability to understand abstract concepts, and curiosity could align well with computer science. His quiet nature and love of puzzle-solving also seem to fit the stereotypical computer science student.

While he has an appreciation for hard work which is important in business, his empathetic nature and love of animals and plants don't seem to match the typical business administration student profile as closely. He may be more interested in technical and scientific subjects rather than business topics.

Of course, this is just a rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypes. Any individual can be well-suited to a variety of fields regardless of personality. But based solely on the description provided, computer science seems a bit more similar to Adam than business administration does.
