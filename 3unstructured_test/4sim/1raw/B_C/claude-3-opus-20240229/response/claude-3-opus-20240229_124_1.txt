Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's quiet nature, curiosity, love of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His personality seems less typical of business administration, which often requires more extroversion and people skills. However, his intelligence, hard work and dedication could serve him well in either field to some degree.
