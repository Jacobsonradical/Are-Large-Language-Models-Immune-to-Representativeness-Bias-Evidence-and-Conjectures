Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. However, business administration also requires dedication and hard work, which Adam seems to appreciate. His warm heart and empathy are positive qualities but not as directly relevant to these particular fields of study. Overall, he seems to align somewhat more with the typical profile of a computer science graduate student compared to business administration.
