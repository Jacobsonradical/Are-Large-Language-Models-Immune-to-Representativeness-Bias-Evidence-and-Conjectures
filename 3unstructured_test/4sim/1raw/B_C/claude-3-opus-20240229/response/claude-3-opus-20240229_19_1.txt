Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with computer science. His quiet nature and love of solving puzzles also seem to align more with a typical computer science student.

While he may share some traits with business students like intelligence and hard work, overall the personality sketch paints a picture more similar to a stereotypical computer science student. His empathy and love of nature and animals seem less typical of a business student.

Of course, these are generalized stereotypes and there is a lot of individual variation among students in any field. But based solely on the personality sketch, computer science seems a stronger match than business administration in my estimation.
