Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggests he would be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His curiosity and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also qualities that would align well with graduate studies in computer science.

While he may share some traits with business administration students like intelligence and work ethic, overall his personality seems less similar to the typical graduate student in that field based on the description provided. His introversion, love of animals and nature, and strong empathy are less directly relevant to business administration studies.
