Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts suggest Adam may be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. However, the sketch doesn't mention technical skills or specific computer science interests.

For business administration, traits like empathy, appreciation for hard work, and a warm heart could be relevant. But overall the sketch suggests Adam may be less similar to a typical MBA student, without mentioning traits like leadership, communication skills, or interest in business topics.
