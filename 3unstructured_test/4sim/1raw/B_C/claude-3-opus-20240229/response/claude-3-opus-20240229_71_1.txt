Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for computer science. His empathy and warm heart are less typical of that field.

Business administration seems like it may be a weaker fit. While Adam's dedication and hard work would serve him well, the personality sketch does not highlight interpersonal skills, competitiveness, or interest in business that are more common in that field.
