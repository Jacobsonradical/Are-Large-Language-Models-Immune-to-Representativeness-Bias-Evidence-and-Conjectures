Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts align well with a typical computer science graduate student. However, the strong empathy and love of animals is less typical, so I did not give a score of 1.

For business administration, problem-solving skills and understanding of hard work and dedication are relevant traits. However, many of the other traits like curiosity about nature, empathy and love of animals are less directly relevant to business administration. So I assessed the similarity there as lower than for computer science.
