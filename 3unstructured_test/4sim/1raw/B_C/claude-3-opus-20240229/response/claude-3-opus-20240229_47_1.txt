Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with computer science. His quiet nature and love of solving puzzles also seem to align more with a typical computer science student.

While he may share some traits with business students like intelligence and hard work, overall the personality sketch paints a picture of someone more aligned with typical computer science traits and interests. Of course, this is a generalization based on limited information.
