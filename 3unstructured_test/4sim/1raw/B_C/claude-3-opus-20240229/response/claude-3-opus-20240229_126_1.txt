Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could align well with computer science. However, his personality traits seem less typical of business administration, which tends to attract more extroverted and competitive individuals. Of course, there is diversity in every field.
