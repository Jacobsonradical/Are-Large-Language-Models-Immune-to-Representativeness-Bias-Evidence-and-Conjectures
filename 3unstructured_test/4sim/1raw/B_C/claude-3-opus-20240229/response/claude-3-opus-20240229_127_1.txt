Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be quite similar to a typical computer science graduate student. His empathy and love of animals seem less relevant to that field.

While he has an appreciation for hard work and dedication which is important in business, other traits like his quiet nature and interests in puzzles and nature seem less aligned with a typical business administration student, so I rated the similarity lower for that field.
