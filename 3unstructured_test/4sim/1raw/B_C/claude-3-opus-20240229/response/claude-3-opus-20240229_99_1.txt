Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong analytical skills, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with a typical computer science graduate student. His curiosity, puzzle-solving nature, and dedication are also qualities that would fit well in computer science.

While he may share some traits with business administration students like intelligence and hard work, the personality sketch suggests he is more introspective and less outgoing than the average business student. His strong interest in nature, animals and puzzles seems a better fit for the more technical, analytical field of computer science rather than the interpersonal, team-oriented nature of many business programs.

Of course, this is just an approximation based on limited information and stereotypical attributes of each field. Graduate students in any discipline exhibit a range of personalities and interests.
