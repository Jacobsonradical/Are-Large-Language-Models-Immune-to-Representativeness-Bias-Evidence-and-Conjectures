Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with computer science. His quiet nature and love of solving puzzles also seem compatible with the field. 

Business administration seems like it might be less of a natural fit given the personality profile, as it often involves more interpersonal interaction and is less focused on abstract problem solving. However, Adam's strong empathy could be an asset in some business roles.

Of course, this is a simplified assessment based on limited information and stereotypes. Individuals can certainly succeed in fields that don't match their personality profile exactly. But based solely on what was provided, computer science seems more closely aligned with Adam's traits and interests compared to business administration.
