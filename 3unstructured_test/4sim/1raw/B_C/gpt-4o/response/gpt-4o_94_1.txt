Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, here are the similarity scores:

{
  "computer science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and good understanding of abstract concepts, he seems to share more common traits with a typical computer science graduate student. On the other hand, while his empathy and appreciation for hard work may also be valued in business administration, it doesn't align strongly with the core characteristics often associated with that field.
