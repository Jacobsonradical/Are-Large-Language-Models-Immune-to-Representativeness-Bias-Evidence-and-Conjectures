Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here are the similarity ratings:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

### Explanation:

- **Business Administration (0.3):**
  - While Adam's high intelligence and understanding of hard work could be beneficial in business administration, his traits such as a love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, as well as his empathy and curiosity, don't strongly align with the typical characteristics often associated with business administration graduate students. Business students are often more focused on management, economics, and organizational behavior.

- **Computer Science (0.7):**
  - Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, along with his enjoyment of solving puzzles, align more closely with the attributes of a typical computer science graduate student. However, while not a perfect match (hence the 0.7), his deep love for nature and animals suggests interests that extend beyond the tech field.
