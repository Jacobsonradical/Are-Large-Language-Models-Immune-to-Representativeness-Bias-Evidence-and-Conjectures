Sure, here is the response based on Adam's personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

In this evaluation, it's considered that Adam's strong curiosity about nature, interest in puzzles, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and empathy more closely align with characteristics typically associated with graduate students in computer science. However, his appreciation for hard work and dedication, while valuable in any field, does not as strongly align with the qualities generally highlighted in business administration studies as compared to those necessary in computer science.
