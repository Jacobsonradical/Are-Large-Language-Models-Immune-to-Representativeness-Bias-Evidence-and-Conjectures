Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and love for solving puzzles align closely with the typical skill set and mindset of a computer science graduate student. Therefore, he is quite similar to a typical graduate student in computer science.

On the other hand, while his strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication may be valued in business administration, his personality traits and interests (such as empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature) do not align as closely with the typical profile of a graduate student in business administration. Hence, the similarity is lower.
