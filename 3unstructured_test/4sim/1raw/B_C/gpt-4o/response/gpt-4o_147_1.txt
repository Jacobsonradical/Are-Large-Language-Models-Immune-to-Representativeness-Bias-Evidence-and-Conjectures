Sure, based on the personality sketch and insights about Adam, here’s an assessment of his similarity to a typical graduate student in the specified fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business administration (0.3):** Adam's strong empathy, curiosity about nature, and deep love for animals don't typically align closely with the focus areas and personality traits commonly found in business administration students, who might emphasize skills like leadership, economics, marketing, and organizational behavior more heavily.

- **Computer science (0.7):** Adam’s high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment in solving puzzles are traits that strongly align with those found in computer science students. However, the focus on nature and animals is less directly linked, slightly affecting the perfect alignment.
