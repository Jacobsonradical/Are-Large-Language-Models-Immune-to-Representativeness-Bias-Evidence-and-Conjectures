Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here's the similarity scale for each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- Adam's empathy and deep love for animals do not strongly align with the typical personality profile of a business administration graduate student, who might more commonly be focused on economic systems, management, and organizational behavior. 
- His interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts suggest a closer alignment with a computer science graduate student, who would often engage in problem-solving, logical thinking, and abstract reasoning.

However, these fields can attract diverse personalities, so these values are not definitive but rather based on the given personality traits and interests.
