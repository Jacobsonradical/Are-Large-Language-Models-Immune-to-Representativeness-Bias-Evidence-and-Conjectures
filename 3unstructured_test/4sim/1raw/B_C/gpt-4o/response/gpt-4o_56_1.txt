Sure! Based on Adam's personality sketch and his interests, here is the similarity rating for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Adam's intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a stronger alignment with computer science than with business administration. While he might have some appreciation for the hard work involved in business administration, his passion for nature, animals, and empathy makes him less similar to the typical graduate student in that field.
