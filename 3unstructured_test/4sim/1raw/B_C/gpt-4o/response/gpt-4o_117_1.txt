### Explanation:
- **Business Administration:** Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work indicate a personality that may not align closely with the typical attributes of a business administration student, who often focuses on economics, management, and strategic thinking. Therefore, he scores relatively low in similarity.
  
- **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, particularly in understanding abstract concepts, make him closer to a typical computer science student, as these traits are valuable in fields involving coding, algorithms, and problem-solving. Thus, he scores higher in similarity for computer science.
