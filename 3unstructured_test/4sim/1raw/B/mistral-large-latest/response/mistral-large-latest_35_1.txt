  "business administration": 0.4
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication may align with graduate students in business administration, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, quiet nature, and strong empathy seem less typical of the field. Additionally, his interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts is more commonly associated with fields like science, mathematics, or philosophy. Therefore, a score of 0.4 reflects a moderate dissimilarity with a typical graduate student in business administration.
