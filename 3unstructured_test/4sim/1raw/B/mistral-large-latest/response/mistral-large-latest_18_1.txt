Explanation: Adam's personality sketch suggests he is more inclined towards fields related to nature, science, or humanities due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. His interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts also suggests a leaning towards analytical or scientific fields rather than business administration. Therefore, he may not be very similar to a typical graduate student in business administration.
