  "business administration": 0.4
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication may align with graduate students in business administration, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, quiet nature, and strong empathy seem less typical of the field. Additionally, his interest in abstract concepts and puzzles may be more aligned with other fields such as science, mathematics, or philosophy. Therefore, a score of 0.4 reflects a moderate level of similarity.
