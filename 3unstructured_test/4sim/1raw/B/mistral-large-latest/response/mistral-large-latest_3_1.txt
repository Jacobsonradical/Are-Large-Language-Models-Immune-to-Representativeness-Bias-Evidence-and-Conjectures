}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant in any field, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, enjoyment of puzzles, and strong empathy seem less typical of graduate students in business administration. Therefore, he is somewhat dissimilar to a typical business administration graduate student, hence the score of 0.4.
