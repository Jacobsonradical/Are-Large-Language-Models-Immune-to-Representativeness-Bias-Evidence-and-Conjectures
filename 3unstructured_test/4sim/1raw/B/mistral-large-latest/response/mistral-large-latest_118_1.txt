  "business administration": 0.4
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication may be relevant to business administration, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his preference for quiet, introspective activities like solving puzzles, seems less typical of graduate students in this field. Therefore, a score of 0.4 reflects a moderate similarity.
