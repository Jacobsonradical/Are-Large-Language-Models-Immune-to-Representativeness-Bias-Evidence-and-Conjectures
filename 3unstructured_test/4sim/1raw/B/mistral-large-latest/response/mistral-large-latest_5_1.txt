  "business administration": 0.4
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication may align with graduate students in business administration, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and preference for quiet, introspective activities like solving puzzles seem less typical of business administration students. Therefore, a score of 0.4 reflects a moderate but relatively low similarity.
