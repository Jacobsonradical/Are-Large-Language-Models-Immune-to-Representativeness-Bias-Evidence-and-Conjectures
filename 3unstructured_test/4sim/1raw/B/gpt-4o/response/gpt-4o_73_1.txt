  "business administration": 0.3
}

The description sketches Adam as a person with strong empathy, curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts. These traits are not typically highlighted in business administration, which often focuses on strategic planning, management, and business operations. Therefore, while Adam may share some common traits of intelligence and dedication, his primary interests and personality traits suggest a relatively lower similarity to a typical business administration graduate student.
