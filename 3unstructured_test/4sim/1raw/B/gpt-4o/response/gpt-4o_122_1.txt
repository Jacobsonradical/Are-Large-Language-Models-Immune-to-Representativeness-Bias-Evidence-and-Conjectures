Adam's personality sketch suggests he has a deep curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and strong empathy, which are not typically the primary traits associated with business administration students, who often focus more on strategic thinking, leadership, and organizational skills. Therefore, while there could be some overlap in general intelligence and appreciation for hard work, the overall similarity is relatively low.
