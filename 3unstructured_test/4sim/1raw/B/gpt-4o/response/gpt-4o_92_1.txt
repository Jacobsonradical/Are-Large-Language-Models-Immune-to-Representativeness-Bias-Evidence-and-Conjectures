  "business administration": 0.3
}

The personality sketch of Adam does not strongly align with the typical attributes associated with graduate students in business administration, such as a focus on leadership, strategic thinking, and an interest in corporate operations and finance. While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work may somewhat align, his primary interests in nature, puzzles, and empathy suggest a closer alignment with fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology rather than business administration.
