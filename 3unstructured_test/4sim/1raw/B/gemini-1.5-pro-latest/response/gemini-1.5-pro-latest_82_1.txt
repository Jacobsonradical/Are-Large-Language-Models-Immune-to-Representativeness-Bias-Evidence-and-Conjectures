  "business administration": "0.4"

**Explanation:**

While Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work are valuable traits in business administration, his core interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts suggest a stronger affinity for fields like biology, environmental science, or even mathematics.  A typical business administration student might be more drawn to finance, marketing, or management. 

Therefore, a similarity score of 0.4 reflects some overlap in general academic aptitude but a significant difference in primary interests and career focus.
