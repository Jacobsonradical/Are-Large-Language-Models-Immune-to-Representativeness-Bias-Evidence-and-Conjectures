  "business administration": "0.4"

**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work are valuable traits in business administration, his core interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts suggest a less typical fit for this field. Business administration often attracts individuals with a stronger interest in finance, marketing, management, and human behavior within organizations.  

A score of 0.4 acknowledges the transferable skills while recognizing that Adam's passions might lead him to a different field.
