  "business administration": "0.4"
} 

**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence and work ethic are valuable traits in business administration, his core interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts suggest he might be more drawn to fields like biology, environmental science, or even mathematics.  A business administration program often attracts individuals with a stronger interest in finance, marketing, management, and economics.  Therefore, Adam's profile aligns moderately (around 0.4) with a typical business administration graduate student.
