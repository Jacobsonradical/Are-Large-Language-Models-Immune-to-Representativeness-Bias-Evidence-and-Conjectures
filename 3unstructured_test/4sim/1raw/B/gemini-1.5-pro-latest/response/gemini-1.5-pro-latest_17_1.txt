  "business administration": "0.4"
} 

**Explanation:**

While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business administration, his core interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts suggest a stronger inclination toward fields like biology, environmental science, or even mathematics.  A typical business administration student might be more drawn to finance, marketing, or management.
