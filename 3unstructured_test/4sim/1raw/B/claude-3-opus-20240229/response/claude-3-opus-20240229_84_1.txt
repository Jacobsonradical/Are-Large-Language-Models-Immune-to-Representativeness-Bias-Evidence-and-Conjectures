Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's strong empathy, love of nature and animals, and interest in abstract concepts suggest he may not be a very close fit for a typical business administration graduate student. However, his high intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication could serve him well in business studies. Overall, I estimate a similarity of 0.4 out of 1 to a typical business administration graduate student.
