{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work, are not strongly associated with typical graduate students in business administration. However, the high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be somewhat relevant. Overall, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical business administration graduate student as 0.4 on a 0 to 1 scale.
