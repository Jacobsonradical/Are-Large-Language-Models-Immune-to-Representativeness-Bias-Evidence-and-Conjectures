Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and abstract thinking, do not seem to align very closely with the typical profile of a business administration student. However, the mention of understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication could apply to business students to some degree. Overall though, the given description seems more characteristic of a student in the natural sciences rather than business, so I estimate a relatively low similarity score of 0.4 out of 1.
