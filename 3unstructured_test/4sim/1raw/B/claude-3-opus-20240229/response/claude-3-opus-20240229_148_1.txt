Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

While Adam's high intelligence could be an asset in business administration, his personality traits seem more aligned with fields involving nature, animals, abstract thinking and problem-solving rather than typical traits of business students. However, without knowing his specific interests and background, he may have some similarity to business students, so I chose a value of 0.4 rather than 0.
