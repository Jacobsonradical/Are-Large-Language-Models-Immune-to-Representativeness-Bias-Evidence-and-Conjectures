Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could serve him well in business administration. However, business administration students tend to be more extroverted and people-oriented rather than quiet puzzle-solvers. They also tend to be more focused on commerce and organizations rather than nature, animals and abstract concepts. So while there is some overlap, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical business administration graduate student to be around 0.4 on a 0 to 1 scale.
