Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work, are not strongly associated with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student. However, the high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be somewhat relevant. Overall, I estimate a similarity of 0.4 out of 1 between Adam and a typical business administration graduate student based on the information provided.
