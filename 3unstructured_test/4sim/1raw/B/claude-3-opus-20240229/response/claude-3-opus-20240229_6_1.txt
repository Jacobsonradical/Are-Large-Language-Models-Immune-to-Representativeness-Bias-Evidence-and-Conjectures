Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work, while admirable, do not seem to align strongly with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student. Business administration tends to attract people who are more interested in finance, management, entrepreneurship, and organizational behavior. However, Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be applicable in a business education setting to some degree.
