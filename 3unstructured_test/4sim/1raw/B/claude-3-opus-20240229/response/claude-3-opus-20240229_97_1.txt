Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

While Adam has a strong work ethic and is intelligent, his deep love of nature, animals, and abstract concepts suggests his personality and interests may not be the strongest match for the typical business administration student. However, some of his traits like dedication and problem-solving skills would be valuable in any field. So I estimate a similarity of 0.4 on a 0 to 1 scale.
