Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, empathy, and abstract thinking, do not seem to strongly align with the typical traits and interests of a business administration graduate student. Business students tend to be more focused on topics like management, finance, marketing and entrepreneurship. However, Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could serve him well in any demanding graduate program.
