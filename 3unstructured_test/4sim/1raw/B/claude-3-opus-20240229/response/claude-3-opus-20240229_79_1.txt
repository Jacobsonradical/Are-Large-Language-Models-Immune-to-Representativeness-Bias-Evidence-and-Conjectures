Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, on a scale from 0 to 1:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have traits and interests that align more with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or environmental science rather than business administration. His curiosity about nature, love of animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts suggest he may be better suited for a field other than the typical business curriculum. However, his intelligence, work ethic and problem-solving skills could still serve him well in business school to some degree, so I rated the similarity as 0.4 rather than 0.
