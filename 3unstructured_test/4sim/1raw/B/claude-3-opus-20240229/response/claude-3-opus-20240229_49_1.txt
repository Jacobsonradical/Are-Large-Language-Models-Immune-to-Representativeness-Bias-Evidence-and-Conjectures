Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

While Adam is intelligent and appreciates hard work, his personality and interests seem more aligned with the natural sciences than with business. His curiosity about nature, love of animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be better suited for a field like biology, environmental science, or even mathematics rather than business administration. However, without more information it's hard to say definitively. The 0.4 rating indicates some similarity but not a strong match in my estimation.
