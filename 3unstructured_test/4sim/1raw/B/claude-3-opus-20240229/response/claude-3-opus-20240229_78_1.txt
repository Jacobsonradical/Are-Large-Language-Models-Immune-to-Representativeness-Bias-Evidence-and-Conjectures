Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

From the description, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps more abstract disciplines like mathematics or philosophy. His curiosity about nature, love of animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be better suited for and more similar to graduate students in those areas. While he has an appreciation for hard work and dedication which is important in business, overall his profile doesn't seem to strongly match the typical business administration graduate student, so I've assigned a similarity score of 0.4 out of 1.0.
