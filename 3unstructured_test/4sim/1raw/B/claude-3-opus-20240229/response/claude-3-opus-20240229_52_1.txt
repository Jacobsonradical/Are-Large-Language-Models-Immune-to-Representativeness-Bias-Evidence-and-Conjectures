Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be applicable to business, his strong interests in nature, animals, puzzles and empathy are not stereotypically associated with business administration. His personality seems more aligned with fields like biology, veterinary medicine, or psychology. However, without more information it's difficult to judge definitively. There is certainly some overlap in skills, but based solely on the description provided, I estimate his similarity to a typical business administration graduate student as 0.4 out of 1.
