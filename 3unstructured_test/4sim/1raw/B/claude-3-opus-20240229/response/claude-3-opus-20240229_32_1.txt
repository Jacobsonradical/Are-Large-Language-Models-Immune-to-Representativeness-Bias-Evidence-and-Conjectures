Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits described - curiosity about nature, love of animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work - are not strongly associated with typical business administration students. Abstract thinking and intelligence could be relevant. But overall, Adam's profile seems to align more with other fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies than with business. Therefore, I rate the similarity as 0.4 out of 1.
