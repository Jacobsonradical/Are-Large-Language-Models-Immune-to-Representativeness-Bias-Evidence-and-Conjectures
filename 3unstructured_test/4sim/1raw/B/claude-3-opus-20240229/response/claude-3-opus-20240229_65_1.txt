Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, on a scale from 0 to 1:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have traits and interests that align more with scientific fields like biology, zoology, or environmental science rather than business administration. His curiosity about nature, love of animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts suggest he may be better suited for a graduate program other than a typical MBA. However, his intelligence, strong work ethic and dedication could serve him well in business school too, so I did not rate the similarity as 0. Overall though, the details provided paint a picture of someone who would likely thrive more in a science-related field compared to the average business administration graduate student.
