Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in the given field, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

While Adam is intelligent and understands hard work and dedication, which are valuable in business, his personality seems more aligned with scientific curiosity, abstract thinking, and empathy. Business administration students often need strong interpersonal skills, assertiveness and an interest in practical applications more so than what was conveyed for Adam. However, without more information it's difficult to judge definitively.
