Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

While Adam has high intelligence and an appreciation for hard work, which could serve him well in business, his personality and interests seem more aligned with the natural sciences than with business administration. His love of nature, animals, puzzles and abstract concepts suggests he may be better suited to a field like biology, zoology, or mathematics rather than the practically-oriented world of business.
