Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits and interests described for Adam - curiosity about nature and plants, enjoying puzzles, empathy and love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work - do not strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student. Business students often have more interest and aptitude in areas like management, finance, marketing and entrepreneurship. However, Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for dedication could translate to some degree of fit and success in business school. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical business administration graduate student as a 0.4 out of 1.
