Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, on a scale from 0 to 1:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam does not seem to share many traits that are typical of business administration students. His curiosity about nature, love of animals, and interest in abstract concepts align more with fields like biology, veterinary science, or mathematics rather than business. However, his intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are qualities that could serve him well in business school, so there is some limited overlap. Overall though, I estimate his similarity to the typical business administration graduate student is relatively low, around 0.4 on a 0 to 1 scale.
