Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work, could be found in some business administration students. However, the overall profile seems more aligned with someone in the life sciences or a helping profession rather than a typical business administration student. Problem-solving skills and high intelligence are relevant, but the emphasis on empathy, abstract thinking and puzzles seems less characteristic of the average MBA student.
