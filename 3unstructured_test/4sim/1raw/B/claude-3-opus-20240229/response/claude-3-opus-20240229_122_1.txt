Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, empathy, and abstract thinking, do not seem to align closely with the typical characteristics and interests of most business administration graduate students. However, the mention of understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication could apply to graduate students in many fields, including business. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low similarity score of 0.3 out of 1.
