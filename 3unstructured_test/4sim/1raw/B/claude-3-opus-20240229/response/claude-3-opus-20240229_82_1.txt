Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in the given field, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could serve him well in business administration, his other traits like strong empathy, love of nature and animals, and interest in abstract concepts seem less typical of graduate students in that field. So I estimate his similarity to a typical business administration grad student as a 0.4 out of 1.
