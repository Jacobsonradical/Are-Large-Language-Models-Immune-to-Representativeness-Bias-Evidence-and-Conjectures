Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

While Adam has a strong work ethic and is intelligent, his deep love of nature, animals, and abstract concepts suggests his personality and interests may not be the strongest match for a typical business administration student. However, some of his traits like curiosity and dedication could translate well to business.
