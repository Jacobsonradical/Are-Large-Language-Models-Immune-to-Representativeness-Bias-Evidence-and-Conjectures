Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits and interests described for Adam - curiosity about nature and plants, enjoying puzzles, empathy and love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciating hard work and dedication - do not seem to align very closely with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student. Business students tend to be more oriented towards leadership, management, entrepreneurship, finance and practical business skills. So I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical business administration graduate student is relatively low, around 0.3 on a 0 to 1 scale.
