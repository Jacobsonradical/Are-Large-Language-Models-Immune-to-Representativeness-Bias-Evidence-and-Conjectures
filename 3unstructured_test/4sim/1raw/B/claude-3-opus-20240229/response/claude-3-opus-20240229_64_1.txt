Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work could suit him well in business administration. However, his quiet nature, love of puzzles and abstract concepts, and strong empathy for animals suggest his personality and interests may align better with other fields, such as biology, veterinary medicine, psychology, or mathematics. Business administration does not seem like the most natural fit given the details provided.
