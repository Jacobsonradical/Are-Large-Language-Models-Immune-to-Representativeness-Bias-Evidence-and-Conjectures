Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, could be found in graduate students across many fields. However, the specific mentions of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts may be somewhat more common among graduate students in quantitative or technical fields rather than business administration. Overall, I would estimate only a moderate similarity of 0.4 out of 1 between Adam's described personality and that of a typical graduate student in business administration.
