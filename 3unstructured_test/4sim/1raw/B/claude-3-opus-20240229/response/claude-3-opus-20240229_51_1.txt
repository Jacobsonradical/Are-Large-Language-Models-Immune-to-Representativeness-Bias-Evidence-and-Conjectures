Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could serve him well in business administration. However, his quiet nature, love of puzzles and abstract concepts, and strong empathy and love for animals seem less typical of graduate students in that field, who may be more outgoing and focused on practical applications in the business world. Therefore, I estimate his similarity to a typical business administration graduate student as 0.4 out of 1.
