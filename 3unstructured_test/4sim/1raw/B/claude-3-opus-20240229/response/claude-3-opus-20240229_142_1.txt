Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

While Adam's high intelligence and strong work ethic could lend themselves to success in business, his primary interests and characteristics - curiosity about nature, love of animals, empathy, and aptitude for abstract concepts - do not strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student. Business students often have more interest in leadership, strategy, finance, and interpersonal skills. So I estimate only a moderate level of similarity between Adam and the average business grad student based on the details provided.
