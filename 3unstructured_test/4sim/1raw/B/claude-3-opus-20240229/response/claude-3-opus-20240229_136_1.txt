Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's deep curiosity, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could serve him well in business administration. However, his quiet nature, focus on abstract concepts rather than practical applications, and strong interest in nature, puzzles and animals seem less typical for a business administration student. So I estimate a similarity of 0.4 out of 1 compared to a typical graduate student in that field.
