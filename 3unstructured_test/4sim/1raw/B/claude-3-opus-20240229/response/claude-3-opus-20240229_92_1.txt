Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits and interests described for Adam - curiosity about nature and plants, enjoying puzzles, empathy and love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work - do not seem to strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student. Business students tend to be more oriented towards leadership, management, finance, and entrepreneurship. However, Adam's intelligence and work ethic would serve him well in any graduate program, so there is some modest overlap. Overall, I estimate Adam's similarity to the average business administration graduate student to be around 0.4 on a 0 to 1 scale.
