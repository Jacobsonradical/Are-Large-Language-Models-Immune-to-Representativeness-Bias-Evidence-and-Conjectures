Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

While Adam has a strong work ethic and intelligence which could serve him well in business, his personality and interests seem more aligned with other fields that involve nature, animals, abstract concepts and problem-solving. Business administration does not seem to be the most natural fit given his curious, empathetic and quiet nature. However, it's certainly possible for someone with his traits to pursue and succeed in business.
