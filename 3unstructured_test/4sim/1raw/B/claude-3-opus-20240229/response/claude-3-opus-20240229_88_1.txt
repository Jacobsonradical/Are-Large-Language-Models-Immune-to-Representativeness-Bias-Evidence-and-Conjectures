Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant traits for business administration. However, his quiet nature, love of animals, and interest in abstract concepts do not seem as directly applicable to a typical business administration student, based on common stereotypes of the field. Of course, individual graduate students in any field can have diverse interests and personalities.
