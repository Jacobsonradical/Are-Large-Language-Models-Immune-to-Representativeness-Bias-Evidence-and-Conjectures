Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could serve him well in business administration. However, the field tends to attract more outgoing and assertive personalities compared to Adam being described as quiet. His strong empathy and love of animals also seem less directly relevant to typical motivations for studying business. So while he has some applicable traits, overall I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical business administration graduate student as a 0.4 out of 1.
