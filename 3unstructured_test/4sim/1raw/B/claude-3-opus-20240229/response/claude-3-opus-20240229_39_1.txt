Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, are not strongly associated with the typical profile of a business administration student. However, the mention of intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are somewhat relevant. Therefore, I estimate a similarity of 0.4 out of 1.
