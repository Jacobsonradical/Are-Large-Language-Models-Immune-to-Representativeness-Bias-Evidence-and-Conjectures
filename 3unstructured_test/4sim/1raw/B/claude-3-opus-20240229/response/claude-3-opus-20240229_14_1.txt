Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

While Adam's high intelligence could lend itself to success in business administration, his personality traits seem more aligned with fields related to nature, animals, abstract thinking and problem-solving rather than typical traits of business students. However, his appreciation for hard work and dedication could translate to the business world to some degree.
