Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits and interests described for Adam do not seem to align especially closely with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student. While he has high intelligence which would serve him well in any graduate program, his deep love of nature, animals, puzzles and abstract concepts seems more characteristic of someone in the natural sciences, mathematics, or certain humanities fields rather than business. Of course, there is diversity among business students and some certainly have those interests - but they are not the most typical traits one would expect. So I rate the similarity as only 0.4 out of 1.
