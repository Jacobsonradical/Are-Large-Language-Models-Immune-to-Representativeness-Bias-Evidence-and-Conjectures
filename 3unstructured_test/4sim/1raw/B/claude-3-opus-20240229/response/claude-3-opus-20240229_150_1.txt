Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

While Adam has a strong work ethic and high intelligence which could serve him well in business administration, his other traits like strong empathy, love of nature and animals, and interest in abstract concepts seem less typical of graduate students in that field. Business administration students often have more interest in practical rather than abstract subjects, and traits like competitiveness and assertiveness are common. So I rate the overall similarity as 0.4 out of 1.
