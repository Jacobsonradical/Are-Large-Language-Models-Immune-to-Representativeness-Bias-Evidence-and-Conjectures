Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work, are not strongly associated with typical graduate students in business administration. Business students tend to be more focused on leadership, management, entrepreneurship, finance, and practical business skills. However, Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be somewhat applicable in business school. Therefore, I rate the similarity as 0.4 out of 1.
