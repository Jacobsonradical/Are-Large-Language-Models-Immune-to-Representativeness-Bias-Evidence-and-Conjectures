Here is my assessment of how similar Adam seems to be to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, do not seem to align strongly with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student. However, the strong work ethic and dedication mentioned could be applicable. Overall, based on the limited information provided, I estimate a similarity of 0.4 out of 1.
