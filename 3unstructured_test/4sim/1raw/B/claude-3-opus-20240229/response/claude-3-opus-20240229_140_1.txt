Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits described - curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love of animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work - are not strongly associated with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student. While intelligence and hard work are important in any field, the other traits are less directly relevant to business. Adam's profile might be a better match for fields like biology, veterinary science, psychology or certain areas of academic research. Of course, there is plenty of individual variation and these traits do not preclude the possibility of Adam being a business student, but based solely on the given description, the overlap seems limited. Hence my estimated similarity score of 0.4 out of 1.0.
