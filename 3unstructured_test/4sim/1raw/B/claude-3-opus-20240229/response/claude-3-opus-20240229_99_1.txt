Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits and interests described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, do not seem to strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student. However, the high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be somewhat relevant. Overall, I estimate a similarity of 0.4 out of 1 between Adam and a typical business administration graduate student based on the information provided.
