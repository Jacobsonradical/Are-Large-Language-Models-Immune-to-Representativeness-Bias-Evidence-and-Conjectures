Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work could serve him well in business administration. However, his quiet nature, love of animals, and interest in abstract concepts do not seem as well aligned with the typical traits and interests of business students. So I would assess his similarity to a typical business administration graduate student as relatively low, around 0.3 on a 0 to 1 scale.
