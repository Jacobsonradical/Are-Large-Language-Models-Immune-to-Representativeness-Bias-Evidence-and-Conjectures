Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits and interests described for Adam - including curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts - do not strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student. However, Adam's intelligence and strong work ethic could be applicable in any graduate program. Therefore, I estimate a moderate similarity of 0.4 between Adam and a typical business administration graduate student based on the information provided.
