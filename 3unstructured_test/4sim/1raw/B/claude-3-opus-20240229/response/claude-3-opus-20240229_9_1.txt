Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

While Adam's high intelligence could be an asset in business administration, his personality and interests seem more aligned with other fields such as biology, psychology, or veterinary medicine. His genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy suggest he may be better suited for and more interested in a field other than business administration. However, his strong work ethic and ability to understand abstract concepts could still serve him well in business to some degree.
