Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, on a scale from 0 to 1:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have some traits that could be relevant for business, such as high intelligence and an appreciation for hard work. However, his strong interest in nature, animals, puzzles and abstract concepts seems less typical of an average business administration student. So while there is some overlap, I estimate the overall similarity is around 0.4 out of 1.
