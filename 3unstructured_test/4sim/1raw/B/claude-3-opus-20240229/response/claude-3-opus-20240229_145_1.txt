Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits and interests described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, do not seem to strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student. However, the mention of strong work ethic and dedication could be somewhat applicable. Overall, I estimate a similarity of 0.4 out of 1.
