Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits and interests described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, empathy, and aptitude for abstract concepts, do not seem to strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student. However, the mention of understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication has some relevance to business. Overall though, the described characteristics seem to point more towards fields in the natural sciences, mathematics, or certain humanities rather than business administration specifically.
