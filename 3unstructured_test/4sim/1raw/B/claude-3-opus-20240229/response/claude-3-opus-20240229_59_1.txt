Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

While Adam is intelligent and appreciates hard work, his personality and interests seem more aligned with fields related to nature, animals, abstract thinking and problem solving. Business administration programs tend to attract students who are more outgoing, competitive, and interested in practical applications rather than abstract concepts. So while there is some overlap, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical business administration grad student is only around 0.4 out of 1.
