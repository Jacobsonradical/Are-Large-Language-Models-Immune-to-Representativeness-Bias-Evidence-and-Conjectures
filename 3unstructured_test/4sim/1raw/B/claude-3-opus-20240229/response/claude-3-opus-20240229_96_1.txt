Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in business administration, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curious nature, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work could suit him well for graduate studies in various fields. However, his specific interests in nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts seem more aligned with fields in the natural sciences, life sciences, or abstract disciplines than with the practical, organization-focused subject of business administration. So I rate the similarity as a 0.4 out of 1.
