Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.9)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with the typical interests and qualities of students in this field. Graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science often have a passion for understanding plant and animal life and are dedicated to this form of study, which resonates strongly with Adam's personality traits.
- **Computer Science (0.5)**: While Adam's high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles could align with the skills needed in computer science, his primary interests seem more nature-oriented than technology-oriented. Therefore, he is somewhat similar but not highly representative of a typical computer science graduate student.
