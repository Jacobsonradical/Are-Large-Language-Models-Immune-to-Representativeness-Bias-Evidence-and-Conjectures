- For computer science: Adam's intelligence, problem-solving ability, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with the skills typically required in computer science. However, the sketch does not mention a specific interest in technology or programming, suggesting that he might not align perfectly with typical computer science students.
- For agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align very closely with the traits typically found in students within agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication is also an important trait in these fields.
