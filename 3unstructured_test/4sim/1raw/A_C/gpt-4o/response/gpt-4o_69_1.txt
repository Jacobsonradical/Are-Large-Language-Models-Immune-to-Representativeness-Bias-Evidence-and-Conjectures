Sure, based on the personality sketch provided, here's my assessment of the similarity:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):**
  Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals strongly align with the typical interests and values of students in this field. His warm heart and understanding of hard work also complement the hands-on, often altruistic aspects of agricultural and veterinary sciences.

- **Computer Science (0.6):**
  Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and a good grasp of abstract concepts, which are qualities beneficial for a computer science student. However, his deep love for nature and animals, which are more related to life sciences, makes him slightly less aligned compared to the specific focus on technology and computing in computer science.
