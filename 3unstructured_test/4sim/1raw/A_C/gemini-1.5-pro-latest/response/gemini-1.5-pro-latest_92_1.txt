**Explanation:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential similarity with computer science graduate students. His high intelligence is also a common trait. However, his love for nature and animals isn't directly mentioned in relation to technology, so it's slightly less certain.  Hence, a score of 0.7 seems appropriate.

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest a high degree of similarity with students in agricultural and veterinary sciences. These fields often attract individuals with these characteristics.  Therefore, a score of 0.9 reflects this strong potential alignment.
