**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and high intelligence align well with a typical computer science graduate student.  However, his love for nature and animals is less typical, though not unheard of. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's deep love for animals and curiosity about nature, particularly plants, make him seem very similar to a typical graduate student in this field. His empathy and understanding of hard work further support this.
