{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why I chose these scores:

* **Computer Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His high intelligence is also a strong asset in this field. However, his personality sketch emphasizes nature and animals, which aren't typical interests for computer science students, hence the score isn't a perfect 1.

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** Adam's deep love for animals and curiosity about plants strongly suggest an affinity for agricultural and veterinary science. His empathy and warm heart further support this, as these fields often involve working closely with living beings. While his enjoyment of puzzles isn't directly mentioned as a common trait in these fields, his intelligence and problem-solving skills are certainly transferable. This makes it a closer match than computer science, but still not a perfect 1 as other aspects of his personality might be less common in these fields.
