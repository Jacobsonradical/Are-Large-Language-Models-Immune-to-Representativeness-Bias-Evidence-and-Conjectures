**Explanation:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's love for animals and curiosity about nature, particularly plants, make him a good fit for these fields. His empathy would also be valuable when working with animals. 

* **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's high intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong traits for computer science. While not as strong a connection as with agricultural and veterinary sciences, these abilities suggest a good level of similarity with students in this field.
