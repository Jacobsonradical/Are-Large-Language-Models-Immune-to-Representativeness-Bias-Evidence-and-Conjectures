  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and high intelligence align well with computer science. His ability to understand abstract concepts is also crucial in this field. However, the description lacks specific indicators of a strong interest in technology or programming, which are common among computer science graduate students. Thus, a score of 0.6 reflects a moderate similarity.

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work strongly resonate with this field.  His empathy suggests a potential interest in animal well-being. Therefore, a score of 0.8 reflects a higher similarity to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
