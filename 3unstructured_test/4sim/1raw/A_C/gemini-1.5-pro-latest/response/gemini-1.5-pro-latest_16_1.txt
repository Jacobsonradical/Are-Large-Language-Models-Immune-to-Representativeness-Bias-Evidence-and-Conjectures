**Explanation:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's puzzle-solving ability, high intelligence, and grasp of abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential similarity with computer science graduate students. However, his love for nature and animals isn't directly related to the field, so the score is high but not a perfect 1. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest a high degree of similarity with students in this field. His other traits, while not exclusive to these areas, could certainly be beneficial, leading to a score very close to 1.
