**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and high intelligence align well with computer science. However, the description emphasizes nature and animals more than technology, making the fit moderate (0.6). 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest alignment with agricultural and veterinary science. This makes him quite similar (0.8) to a typical graduate student in these fields.
