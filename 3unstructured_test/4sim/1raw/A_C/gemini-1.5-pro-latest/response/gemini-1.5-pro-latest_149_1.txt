**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and high intelligence align well with computer science. However, his passion for nature isn't a typical trait in this field, though it's not unheard of.  Therefore, a moderate similarity score of 0.6 seems appropriate.

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest an affinity for agricultural and veterinary science. His empathy and warm heart further support this. Thus, a high similarity score of 0.8 is assigned.
