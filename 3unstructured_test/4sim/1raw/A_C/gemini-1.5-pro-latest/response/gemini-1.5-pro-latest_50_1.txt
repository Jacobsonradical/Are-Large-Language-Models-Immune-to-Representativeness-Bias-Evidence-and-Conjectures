**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence suggest an affinity for the problem-solving nature of computer science.  His abstract thinking ability is also valuable in this field. However, the description doesn't directly mention interests typically associated with computer science like technology or programming. 

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for animals and curiosity about nature strongly align with these fields. His empathy would also be beneficial in working with animals. His appreciation for hard work is relevant to the demands of these fields. Therefore, he aligns more closely with a typical graduate student in these areas.
