Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts and problem-solving suggest he could fit the profile of a computer science grad student to some degree. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are traits that seem more characteristic of a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. Of course, these are generalizations and any individual may deviate from the typical profile of their field.
