Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit that field.

While he has high intelligence which is important for computer science, the personality sketch doesn't mention technical skills or specific interest in computing, so he seems only moderately similar to a typical computer science grad student based on the information provided.
