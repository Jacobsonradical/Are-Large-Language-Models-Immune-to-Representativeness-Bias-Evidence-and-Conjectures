Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about plants and nature, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also make him somewhat similar to a typical computer science graduate student, though perhaps not quite to the same degree as for agricultural and veterinary science based on the description provided.
