Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and strong empathy align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and aptitude for solving puzzles also fit decently with a computer science graduate student profile, though perhaps not quite as strongly as with agricultural and veterinary science.
