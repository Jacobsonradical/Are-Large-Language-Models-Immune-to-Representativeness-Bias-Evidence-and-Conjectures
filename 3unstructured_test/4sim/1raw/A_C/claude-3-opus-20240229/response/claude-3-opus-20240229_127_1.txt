Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy are less typical of that field.

On the other hand, Adam's love of nature, plants, animals, and empathy align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence and hard work ethic would also serve him well in this field of study.
