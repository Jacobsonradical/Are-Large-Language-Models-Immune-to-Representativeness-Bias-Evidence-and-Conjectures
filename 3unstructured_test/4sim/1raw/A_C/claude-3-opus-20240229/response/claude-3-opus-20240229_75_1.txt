Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's love of puzzles, strong abstract thinking abilities, and high intelligence would make him somewhat similar to a typical computer science grad student. However, his personality sketch emphasizes more his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and empathy, which seem to align him more closely with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.
