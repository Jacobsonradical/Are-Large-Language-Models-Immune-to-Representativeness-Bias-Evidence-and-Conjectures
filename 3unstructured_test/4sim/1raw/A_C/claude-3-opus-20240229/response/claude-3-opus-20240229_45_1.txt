Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be somewhat similar to a typical computer science graduate student. However, his strong empathy, love of animals, and interest in nature and plants make him seem even more similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
