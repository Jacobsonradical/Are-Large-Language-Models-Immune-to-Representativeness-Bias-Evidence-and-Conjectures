Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation:
Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy, suggests he would be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also qualities that would serve him well in this field.

While Adam's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him a successful computer science student, his personality sketch does not emphasize a specific interest or aptitude for technology and programming. Therefore, I rated his similarity to a typical computer science graduate student slightly lower.
