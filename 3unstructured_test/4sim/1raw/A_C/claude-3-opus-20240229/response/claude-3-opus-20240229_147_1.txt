Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. His quiet personality, puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts also fits the profile of many computer science grad students to some degree, but the overall description seems to align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science.
