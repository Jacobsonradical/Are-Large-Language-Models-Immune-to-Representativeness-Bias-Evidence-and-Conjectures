Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love for nature, plants and animals, as well as his empathy, suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.

His intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts also make him somewhat similar to a typical computer science graduate student. However, the personality sketch focuses more on his interest in nature than technology-related traits, so I rate the computer science similarity a bit lower.
