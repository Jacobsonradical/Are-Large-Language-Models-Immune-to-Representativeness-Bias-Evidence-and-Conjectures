Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science. However, his personality sketch emphasizes more his love of nature, animals, and hard work, which seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. So while he has some similarities to a typical computer science grad student, I believe he has a stronger overlap with the profile of an agricultural/veterinary science grad student.
