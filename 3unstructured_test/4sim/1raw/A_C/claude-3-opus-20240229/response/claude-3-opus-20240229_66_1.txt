Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be a very good fit for graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve him well in computer science, but his overall profile seems more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science based on the details provided.
