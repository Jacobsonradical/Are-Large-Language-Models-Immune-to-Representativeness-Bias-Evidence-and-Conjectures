Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals along with his strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science graduate student. His quiet demeanor, aptitude for puzzles and abstract concepts, and high intelligence also fit the profile of many computer science students, though perhaps not quite as strongly as for agricultural/veterinary science based on the description provided.
