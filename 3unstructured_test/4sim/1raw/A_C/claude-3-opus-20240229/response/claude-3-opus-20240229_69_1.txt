Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and dedication suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills and enjoyment of puzzles also suggest some similarity to a typical computer science student, but the alignment seems a bit weaker based solely on the details provided in the personality sketch.
