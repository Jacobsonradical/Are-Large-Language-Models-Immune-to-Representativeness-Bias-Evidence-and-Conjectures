Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals along with his strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science grad student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills and appreciation for hard work and dedication would also fit well in those fields.

While Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest some similarity to a typical computer science grad student, his other traits seem less aligned with that field, leading to a lower similarity score compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Of course, any individual can be successful in a variety of fields regardless of general personality trends.
