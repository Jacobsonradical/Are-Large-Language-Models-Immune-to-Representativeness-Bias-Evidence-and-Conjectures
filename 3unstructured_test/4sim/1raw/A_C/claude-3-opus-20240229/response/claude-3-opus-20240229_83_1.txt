Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, problem-solving skills, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may have some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student. However, his strong empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for nature and plants seem to align more closely with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.
