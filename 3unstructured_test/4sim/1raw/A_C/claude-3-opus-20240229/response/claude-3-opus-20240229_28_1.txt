Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be somewhat similar to a typical computer science graduate student. However, his warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals, along with his curiosity about nature and plants, make him seem even more similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
