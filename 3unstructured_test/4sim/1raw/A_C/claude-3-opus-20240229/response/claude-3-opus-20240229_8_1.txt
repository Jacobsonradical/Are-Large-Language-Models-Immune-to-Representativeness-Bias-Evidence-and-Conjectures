Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals along with his strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also align reasonably well with computer science, though perhaps not quite as strongly as with agricultural and veterinary science given his other traits and interests.
