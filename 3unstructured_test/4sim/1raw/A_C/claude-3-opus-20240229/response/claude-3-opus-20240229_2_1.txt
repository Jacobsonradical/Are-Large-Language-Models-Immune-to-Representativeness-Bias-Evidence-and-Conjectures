Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and skill at understanding abstract concepts suggest he could be a reasonably good fit for computer science. However, his strong empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for nature and plants indicate he may be an even better fit for agricultural and veterinary science compared to the typical graduate student in that field.
