Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals along with his strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science grad student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills and interest in puzzles also align somewhat with typical computer science students, but the overlap seems less strong than with agricultural and veterinary science based on the description provided.
