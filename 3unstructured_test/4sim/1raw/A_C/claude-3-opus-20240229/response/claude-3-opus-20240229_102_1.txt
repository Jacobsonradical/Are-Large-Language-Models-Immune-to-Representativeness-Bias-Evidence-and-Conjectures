Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about plants and nature, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.

His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles indicate some similarity to a typical computer science grad student. However, the sketch emphasized more his interest in nature and animals rather than technology, so I rated the similarity a bit lower for CS.
