Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals, as well as his strong empathy, seem to align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could also translate well to computer science. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more of an affinity for the natural world over technology and computing, so I rated the similarity a bit higher for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
