Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's strong love for animals, curiosity about plants and nature, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also align reasonably well with computer science, though perhaps not quite as strongly as with agricultural and veterinary science based on the details provided.
