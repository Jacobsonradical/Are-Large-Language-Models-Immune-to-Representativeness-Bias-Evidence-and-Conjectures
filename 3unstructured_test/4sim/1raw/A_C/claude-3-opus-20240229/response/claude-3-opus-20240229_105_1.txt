Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet nature, interest in puzzles, high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also fits the profile of many computer science graduate students. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more his interest in nature and animals over technology and programming, so I rated the similarity a bit higher for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
