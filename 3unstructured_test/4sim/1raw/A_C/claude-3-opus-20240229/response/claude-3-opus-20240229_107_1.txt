Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and dedication, seem to align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His abstract thinking skills and intelligence could also suit computer science, but the personality sketch emphasizes more traits that seem relevant to agricultural and veterinary fields. Of course, this is a subjective estimate based on limited information.
