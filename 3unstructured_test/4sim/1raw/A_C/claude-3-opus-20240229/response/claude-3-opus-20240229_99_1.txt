Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals along with his strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and appreciation for hard work and dedication would also fit well in that field.

While Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest some similarity to computer science graduate students, his overall profile seems somewhat less aligned with the typical computer science student compared to agricultural and veterinary science. However, he still likely has reasonable overlap given his cognitive abilities and problem-solving interests.
