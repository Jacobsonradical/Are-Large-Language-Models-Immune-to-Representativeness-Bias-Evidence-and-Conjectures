Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, his personality sketch emphasizes more his love of nature, animals, and hard work, which seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. So while he has some similarities to a computer science grad student, I believe he matches the profile of an agricultural/veterinary science grad student to a higher degree based on the description provided.
