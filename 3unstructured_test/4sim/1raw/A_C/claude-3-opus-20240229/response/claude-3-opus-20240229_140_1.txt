Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals, as well as his strong empathy, seem to align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit the profile of a computer science student to some degree, but the personality sketch emphasizes more his interest in the natural world which is why I rated the similarity a bit lower for computer science.
