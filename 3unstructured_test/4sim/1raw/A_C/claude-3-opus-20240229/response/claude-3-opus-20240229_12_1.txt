Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles also align fairly well with a typical computer science graduate student profile, though perhaps not quite as strongly as with agricultural and veterinary science.
