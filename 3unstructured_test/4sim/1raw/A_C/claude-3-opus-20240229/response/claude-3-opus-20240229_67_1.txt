Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may have some similarity to computer science graduate students. However, his personality sketch emphasizes more his love of nature, animals, and his empathy, which seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. So I rated his similarity higher for agricultural and veterinary science graduate students.
