Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication seem very well aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit well with computer science, but the personality sketch emphasizes more his interest in the natural world. Of course, this is just my estimate based on limited information. There is likely significant variation among graduate students in any field.
