Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants and deep love for animals suggests he would be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet nature, puzzle-solving skills, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are also qualities that would suit computer science well. However, the emphasis on his affinity for nature, plants and animals makes me think agricultural and veterinary science is a somewhat stronger match overall, so I rated that field slightly higher in similarity.
