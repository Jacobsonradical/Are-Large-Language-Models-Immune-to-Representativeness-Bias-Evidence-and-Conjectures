Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals along with his strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.  His intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts also align reasonably well with the typical profile of a computer science graduate student, though perhaps not quite as strongly as with agricultural and veterinary science.
