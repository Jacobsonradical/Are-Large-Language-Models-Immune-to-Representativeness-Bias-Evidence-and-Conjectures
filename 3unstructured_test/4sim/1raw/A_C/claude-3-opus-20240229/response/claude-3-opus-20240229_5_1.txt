Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts suggests he could fit the profile of a computer science graduate student to some degree. However, his deep love of animals, nature and plants seems to align him more closely with the typical profile of an agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.
