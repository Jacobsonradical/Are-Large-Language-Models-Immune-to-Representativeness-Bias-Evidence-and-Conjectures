Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals along with his strong empathy and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student.

His intelligence, abstract thinking skills and enjoyment of solving puzzles also give him things in common with a typical computer science grad student, though perhaps to a lesser degree than agricultural and veterinary science based on the description provided.
