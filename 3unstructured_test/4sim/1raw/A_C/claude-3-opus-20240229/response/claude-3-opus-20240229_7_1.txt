Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals along with his strong empathy suggest he may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also traits that would fit well in that field.

While Adam's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him a good fit for computer science as well, the personality sketch doesn't emphasize technical or mathematical inclinations as directly. So I assess his similarity there as somewhat lower, but still above average.

Of course, this is a subjective estimate based on limited information. Many other factors beyond this brief sketch would determine how well Adam actually fits with graduate study in these or any other fields.
