Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and strong empathy suggest he may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles also hint at some overlap with computer science. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more his interest in nature and animals over technical skills, so I rate the similarity a bit higher for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
