Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals along with his strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also align somewhat with the profile of a typical computer science grad student, but the overlap seems less strong than for agricultural and veterinary science based on the personality description provided.
