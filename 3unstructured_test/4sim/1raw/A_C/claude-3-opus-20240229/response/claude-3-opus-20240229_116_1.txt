Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts suggest he could fit the profile of a computer science graduate student to some degree. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are traits that seem even more strongly aligned with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.
