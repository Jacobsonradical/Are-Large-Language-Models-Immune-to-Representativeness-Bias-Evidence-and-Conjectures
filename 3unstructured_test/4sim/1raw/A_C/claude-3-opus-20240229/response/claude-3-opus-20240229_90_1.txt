Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may have some similarity to computer science graduate students. However, his strong empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for nature and plants make him seem even more similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.
