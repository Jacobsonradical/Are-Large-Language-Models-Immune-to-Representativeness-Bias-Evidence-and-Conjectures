Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals along with his strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. His interest in puzzles, abstract concepts, and intelligence also align somewhat with computer science, but the overall profile seems to fit agricultural and veterinary science a bit more closely in my estimation.
