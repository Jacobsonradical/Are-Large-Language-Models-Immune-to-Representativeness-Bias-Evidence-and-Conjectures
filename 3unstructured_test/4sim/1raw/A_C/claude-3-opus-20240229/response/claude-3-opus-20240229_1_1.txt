Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and skill at understanding abstract concepts suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, his strong interest in nature, animals and empathy are more typically associated with agricultural and veterinary science, so I score him as more similar to a typical grad student in that field.
