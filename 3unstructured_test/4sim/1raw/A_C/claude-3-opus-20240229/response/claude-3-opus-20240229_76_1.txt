Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's strong love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and empathy align well with typical traits of agricultural and veterinary science students, so I ranked that similarity quite high at 0.8.

His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are traits that would also fit well with computer science. However, the sketch emphasized more his interest in nature and animals. So I ranked the computer science similarity a bit lower at 0.6, but still above average since he has relevant traits and abilities for that field as well.
