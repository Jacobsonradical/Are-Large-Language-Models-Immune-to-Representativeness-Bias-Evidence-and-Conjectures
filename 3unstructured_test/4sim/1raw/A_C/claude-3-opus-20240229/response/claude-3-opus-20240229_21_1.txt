Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's strong interest in nature, plants and animals, as well as his deep love and empathy for animals, suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.

His quiet nature, enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also suggests some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more his interest in nature and animals, so I rate the computer science similarity a bit lower.
