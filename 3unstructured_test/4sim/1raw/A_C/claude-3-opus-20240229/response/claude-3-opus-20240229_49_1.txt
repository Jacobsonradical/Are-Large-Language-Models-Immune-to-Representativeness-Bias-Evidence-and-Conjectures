Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals along with his dedication and hard work align well with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit reasonably well with computer science, though perhaps not quite as strongly as with agricultural and veterinary science based on the description provided.
