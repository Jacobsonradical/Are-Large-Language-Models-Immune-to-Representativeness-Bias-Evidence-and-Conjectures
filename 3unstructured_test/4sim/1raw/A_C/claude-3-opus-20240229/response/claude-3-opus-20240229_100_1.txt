Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and hard work suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science grad student. His intelligence, problem-solving skills and ability to understand abstract concepts also align somewhat with a typical computer science grad student, though perhaps to a slightly lesser degree than agricultural/veterinary science based on the description provided.
