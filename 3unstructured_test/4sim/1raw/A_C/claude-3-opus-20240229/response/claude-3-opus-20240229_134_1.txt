Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. Of course, this is a subjective estimate based on limited information about Adam and typical graduate student profiles in each field.
