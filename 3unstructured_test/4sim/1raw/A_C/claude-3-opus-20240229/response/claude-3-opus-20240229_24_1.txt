Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about plants and nature, and strong empathy align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science student. His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles are also relevant traits for computer science, though perhaps not quite as strongly indicated as for agricultural and veterinary science based on the description provided.
