Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet demeanor, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also fits reasonably well with a typical computer science graduate student profile, though perhaps not quite as strongly as with agricultural and veterinary science.
