Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts suggest he could fit the profile of a computer science grad student to some degree. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy align him more closely with a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, in my estimation.
