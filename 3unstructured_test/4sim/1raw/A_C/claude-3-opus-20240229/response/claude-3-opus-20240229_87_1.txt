Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of having a curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest Adam may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, having high intelligence, and being good at understanding abstract concepts are somewhat aligned with a typical computer science graduate student. However, the sketch overall seems to emphasize Adam's interest in nature and animals more than topics related to computer science.
