Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and his strong empathy suggest he may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and enjoyment of puzzles also align somewhat with a typical computer science grad student, but perhaps to a lesser degree than agricultural and veterinary science based on the details provided.
