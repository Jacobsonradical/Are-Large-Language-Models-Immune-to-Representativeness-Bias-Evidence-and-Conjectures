Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals suggests he may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles also fits the profile of many computer science grad students. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more of his interest in nature and animals compared to computer-related topics, so I rated the similarity a bit higher for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
