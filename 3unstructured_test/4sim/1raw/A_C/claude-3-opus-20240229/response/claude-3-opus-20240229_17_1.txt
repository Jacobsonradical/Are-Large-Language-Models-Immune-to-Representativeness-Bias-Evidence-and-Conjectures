Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals along with his strong empathy and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. His intelligence, abstract thinking ability and enjoyment of puzzles also fit the profile of many computer science students, though perhaps to a slightly lesser degree than agricultural/veterinary science based on the description provided.
