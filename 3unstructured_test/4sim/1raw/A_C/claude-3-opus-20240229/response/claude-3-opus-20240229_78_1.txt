Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts would fit well with computer science. However, his love of nature, animals, and empathy seem to align even more closely with the typical profile of a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
