Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts and problem-solving seem well-suited for computer science. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy align even more closely with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student profile in my estimation.
