Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love for nature, animals, and strong empathy suggest he may be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills and enjoyment of puzzles also align somewhat with computer science, though perhaps to a lesser degree than agricultural and veterinary science based on the description provided.
