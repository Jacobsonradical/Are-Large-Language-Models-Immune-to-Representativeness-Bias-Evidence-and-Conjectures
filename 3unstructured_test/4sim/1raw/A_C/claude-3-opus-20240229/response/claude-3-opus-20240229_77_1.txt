Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals along with his empathy and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills and enjoyment of puzzles also align somewhat with computer science, but the personality sketch emphasizes more his interest in the natural world over technology and computing. So I rate the similarity a bit lower for CS.
