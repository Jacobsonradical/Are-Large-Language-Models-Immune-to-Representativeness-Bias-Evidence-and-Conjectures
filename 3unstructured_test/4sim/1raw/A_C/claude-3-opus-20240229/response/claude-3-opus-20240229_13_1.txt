Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could be a reasonably good fit for computer science. However, his personality sketch emphasizes more his love of nature, animals, and hard work, which seem to align him more closely with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.
