Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals, as well as his strong empathy, seem to align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit with computer science, but the personality sketch emphasizes more his interest in the natural world rather than technology, so I rated the similarity a bit lower for computer science.
