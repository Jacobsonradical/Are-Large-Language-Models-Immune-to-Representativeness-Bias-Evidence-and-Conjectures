Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may have some similarity to computer science graduate students. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy are traits more typically associated with agricultural and veterinary science graduate students.
