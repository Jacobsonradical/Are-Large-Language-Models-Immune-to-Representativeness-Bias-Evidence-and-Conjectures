Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals suggests he may be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend itself to computer science as well, but the personality sketch emphasizes more his interest in nature and animals, which is why I rated agricultural and veterinary science higher in similarity.
