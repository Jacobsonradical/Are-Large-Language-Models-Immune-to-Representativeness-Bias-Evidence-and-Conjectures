Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals, as well as his strong empathy, suggest he would be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also suit him well for computer science, but the personality sketch emphasizes his connection to nature more than technology, so I rate the similarity a bit lower for CS.
