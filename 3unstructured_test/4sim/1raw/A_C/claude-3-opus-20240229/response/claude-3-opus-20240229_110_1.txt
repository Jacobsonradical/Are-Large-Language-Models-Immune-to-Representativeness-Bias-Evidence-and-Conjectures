Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and hard work suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and enjoyment of puzzles also align somewhat with traits of many computer science grad students. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more of an affinity for the natural world over technology and computing.
