Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals along with his curiosity, empathy and appreciation for hard work suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science grad student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills and enjoyment of puzzles also align somewhat with computer science, but the overall description paints a picture more closely matching an agricultural/veterinary focus in my estimation.
