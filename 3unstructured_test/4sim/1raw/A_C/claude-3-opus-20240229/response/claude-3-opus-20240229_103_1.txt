Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and hard work suggests he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence, curiosity, and skill at understanding abstract concepts indicate some similarity to computer science graduate students, but the personality sketch emphasizes more his interest in nature and animals rather than technology, so I rate the computer science similarity a bit lower.
