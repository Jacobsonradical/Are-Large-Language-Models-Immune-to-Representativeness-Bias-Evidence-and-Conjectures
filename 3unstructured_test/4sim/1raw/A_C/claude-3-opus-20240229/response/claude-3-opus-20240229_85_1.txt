Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's strong interest in nature, plants and animals, as well as his deep empathy and love for animals, suggests he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also suggests some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more his interest in nature and animals rather than technology, so I assess the similarity as lower than for agricultural and veterinary science.
