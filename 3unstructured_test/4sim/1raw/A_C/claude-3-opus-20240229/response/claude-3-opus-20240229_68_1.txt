Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals along with his strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and puzzle-solving align reasonably well with computer science, but seem a bit less central to his core personality and interests compared to his agricultural/veterinary fit.
