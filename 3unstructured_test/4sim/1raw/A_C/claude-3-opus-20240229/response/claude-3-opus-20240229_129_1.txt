Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science graduate student. His curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts also align with computer science, but the personality sketch emphasizes more his interest in natural science. Of course, without more specifics about his academic background and research interests, this is a high-level estimate based solely on the personality description provided.
