Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts suggest he could be a decent fit for computer science. However, his strongest traits - his love of nature, animals, and hard work - align very closely with the typical profile of an agricultural or veterinary science graduate student.
