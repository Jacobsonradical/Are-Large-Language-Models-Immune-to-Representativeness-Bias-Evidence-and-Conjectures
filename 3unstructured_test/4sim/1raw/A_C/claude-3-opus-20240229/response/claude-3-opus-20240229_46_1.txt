Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he may be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts also hint at some similarity to computer science graduate students. However, the personality sketch focuses more on his interest in nature and animals rather than technology, so I rated the similarity a bit higher for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
