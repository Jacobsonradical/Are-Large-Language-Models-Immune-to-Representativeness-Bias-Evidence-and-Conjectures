Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be somewhat similar to a computer science graduate student. However, his strong interest in nature, animals, and empathy are traits more typically associated with agricultural and veterinary science graduate students. So while he shares some similarities with computer science students, his profile seems to align more closely overall with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.
