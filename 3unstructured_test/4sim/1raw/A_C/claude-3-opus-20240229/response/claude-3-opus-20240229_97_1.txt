Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet personality, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also fits relatively well with a typical computer science graduate student profile. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more his interest in nature and animals over technology and computing, so I rated the computer science similarity a bit lower.
