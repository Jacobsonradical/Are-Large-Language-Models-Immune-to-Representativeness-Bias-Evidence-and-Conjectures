Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals, as well as his strong empathy, seem to align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are also relevant traits.

While Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts could translate to computer science, the personality sketch doesn't provide strong evidence of technical skills or specific interest in that field compared to agricultural and veterinary science. So I rated the similarity a bit lower for computer science.
