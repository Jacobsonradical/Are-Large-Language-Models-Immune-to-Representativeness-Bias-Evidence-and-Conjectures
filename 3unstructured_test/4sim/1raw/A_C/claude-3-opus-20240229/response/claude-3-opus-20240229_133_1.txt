Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him a good fit for computer science. However, his personality sketch emphasizes more his love of nature, animals, and hard work, which seem to align him more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information. Many different personality types can succeed in any given field.
