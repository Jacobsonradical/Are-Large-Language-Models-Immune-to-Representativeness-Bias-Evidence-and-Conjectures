Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His ability to understand abstract concepts and solve puzzles also fits well with this field.

While his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills would also serve him well in computer science, the personality sketch focuses more on his interest in nature and animals rather than technology. So I rated the similarity a bit lower for computer science, but still above average since his analytical strengths would be an asset in that field as well.
