Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, his strong love of animals and nature, along with his empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication, make him seem like an even stronger match for agricultural and veterinary science graduate studies.
