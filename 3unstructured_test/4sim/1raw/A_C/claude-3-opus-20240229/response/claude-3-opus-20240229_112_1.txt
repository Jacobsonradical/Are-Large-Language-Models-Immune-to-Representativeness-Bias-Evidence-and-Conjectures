Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's strong interest in nature, plants and animals, as well as his warm heart and empathy, seem very well aligned with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also fit the profile of many computer science graduate students. However, the personality sketch emphasized more of his interest in the natural world rather than technology.

Of course, this is just my estimate based on the limited information provided. There can be significant individual variation among graduate students in any field.
