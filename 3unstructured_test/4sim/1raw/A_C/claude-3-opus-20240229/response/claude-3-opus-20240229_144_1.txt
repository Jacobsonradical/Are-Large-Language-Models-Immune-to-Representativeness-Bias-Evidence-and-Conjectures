Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy, suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are qualities that would also serve him well in computer science. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more of an alignment with agricultural and veterinary science overall.
