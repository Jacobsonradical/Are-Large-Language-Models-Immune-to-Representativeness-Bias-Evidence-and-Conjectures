Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and hard work suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts and puzzle-solving are also traits that would align well with computer science, though perhaps not quite as strongly as with agricultural and veterinary science given his other interests and traits.
