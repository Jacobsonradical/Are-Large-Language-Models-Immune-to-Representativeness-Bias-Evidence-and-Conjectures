Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may share some similarities with computer science graduate students. However, his strong empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for nature and plants seem more aligned with the typical profile of an agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.
