Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about plants and nature, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. 

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles indicate some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more his interest in nature and animals rather than technology, so I rate the computer science similarity a bit lower.
