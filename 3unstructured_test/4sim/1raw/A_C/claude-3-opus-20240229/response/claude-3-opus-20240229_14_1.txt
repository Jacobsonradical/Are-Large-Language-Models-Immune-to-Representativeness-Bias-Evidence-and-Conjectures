Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals, as well as his strong empathy, seem to align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science student. His curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with either field. However, his specific interests seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, based solely on the information provided. Of course, many other factors beyond this brief personality sketch would influence his actual fit and similarity to typical graduate students in these fields.
