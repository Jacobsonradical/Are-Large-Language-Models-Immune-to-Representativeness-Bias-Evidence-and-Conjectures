Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking suggests he may be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and puzzle-solving skills could also suit computer science, but the personality description emphasizes more his interest in nature and animals. Of course, this is just a rough estimate based on limited information about his personality and interests.
