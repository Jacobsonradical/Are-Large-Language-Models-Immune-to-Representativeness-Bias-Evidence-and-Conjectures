Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also align somewhat with traits of many computer science graduate students, though the other attributes mentioned are less directly relevant to computer science.
