Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals along with his strong empathy and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, problem-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts also align somewhat with computer science, but the overall profile seems to fit agricultural and veterinary science a bit more closely based on the description provided.
