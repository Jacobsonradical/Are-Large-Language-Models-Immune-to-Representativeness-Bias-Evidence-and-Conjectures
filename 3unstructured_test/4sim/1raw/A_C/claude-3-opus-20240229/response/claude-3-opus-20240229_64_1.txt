Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals, as well as his empathy and dedication, seem to align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills and enjoyment of puzzle-solving also fit the profile of many computer science graduate students. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more of his interests related to agriculture and veterinary science, so I rated the similarity there slightly higher than for computer science.
