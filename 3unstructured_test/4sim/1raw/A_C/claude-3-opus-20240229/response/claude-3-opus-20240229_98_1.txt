Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals, as well as his empathy and dedication, seem to align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.  His intelligence, abstract thinking skills and enjoyment of puzzles also fit the profile of many computer science students. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more of an alignment with agricultural and life sciences over computer science, so I rated the similarity higher for agricultural and veterinary science.
