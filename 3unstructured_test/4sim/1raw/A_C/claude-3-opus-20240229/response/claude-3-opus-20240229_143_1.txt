Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals along with his dedication and hard work align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science student. His intelligence, problem-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts also fit the profile of many computer science students, but his personality overall seems more geared towards the life sciences than technology. Of course, there is plenty of individual variation within any field.
