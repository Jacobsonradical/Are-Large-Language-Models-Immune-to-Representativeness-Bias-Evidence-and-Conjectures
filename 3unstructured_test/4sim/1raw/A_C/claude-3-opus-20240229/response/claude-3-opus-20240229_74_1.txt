Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, his deep love of animals and nature along with his empathy align even more closely with a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in my estimation.
