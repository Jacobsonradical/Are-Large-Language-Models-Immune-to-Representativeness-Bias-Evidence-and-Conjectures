Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, his personality sketch emphasizes more his love of nature, plants, animals and appreciation for hard work, which seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. So while he has some similarities to a typical computer science grad student, I rated his similarity higher for agricultural and veterinary science.
