Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and dedication suggest he may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and puzzle-solving point to some similarity with computer science students as well, but the overall profile seems to align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science.
