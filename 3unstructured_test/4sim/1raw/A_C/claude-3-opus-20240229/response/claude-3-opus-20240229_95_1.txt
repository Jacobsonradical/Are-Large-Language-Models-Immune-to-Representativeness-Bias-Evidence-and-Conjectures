Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve him well in this field.

While Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and abstract thinking abilities would make him similar in some ways to a typical computer science graduate student, his personality sketch overall seems to align a bit more with agricultural and veterinary science. Computer science is not as directly related to his core interests in nature, plants and animals.
