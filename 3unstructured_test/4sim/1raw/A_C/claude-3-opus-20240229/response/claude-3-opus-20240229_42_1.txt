Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His ability to understand abstract concepts and high intelligence would also serve him well in this field.

While Adam's skills in problem-solving and abstract thinking would make him somewhat similar to a typical computer science graduate student, his specific interests seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science based on the personality sketch provided. However, he still shares some key traits with computer science students.
