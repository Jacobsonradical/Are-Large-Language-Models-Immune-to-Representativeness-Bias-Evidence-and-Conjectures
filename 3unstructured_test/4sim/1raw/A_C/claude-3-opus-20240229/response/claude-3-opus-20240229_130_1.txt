Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, problem-solving skills and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy indicate an even stronger alignment with agricultural and veterinary science. The personality sketch portrays him as more similar overall to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary fields.
