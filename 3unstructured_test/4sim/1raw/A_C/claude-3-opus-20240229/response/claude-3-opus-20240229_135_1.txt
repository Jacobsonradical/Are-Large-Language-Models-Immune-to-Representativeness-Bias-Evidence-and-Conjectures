Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals along with his strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. His quiet nature, puzzle-solving skills, intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts indicate some similarity to a typical computer science grad student as well, but the alignment seems a bit less strong than with agricultural and veterinary science based on the description provided.
