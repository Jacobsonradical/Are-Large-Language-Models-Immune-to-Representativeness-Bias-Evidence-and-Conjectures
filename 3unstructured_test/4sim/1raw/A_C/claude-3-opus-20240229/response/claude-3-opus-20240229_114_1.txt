Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals along with his strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also fit the profile of many computer science graduate students, though perhaps to a slightly lesser degree than agricultural and veterinary science based on the description provided.
