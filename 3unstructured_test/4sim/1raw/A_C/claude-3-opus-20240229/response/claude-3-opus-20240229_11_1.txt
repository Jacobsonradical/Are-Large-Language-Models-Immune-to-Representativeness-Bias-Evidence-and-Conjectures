Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may share some traits with computer science graduate students. However, his strong interest in nature, animals, and empathy align more closely with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student profile in my estimation.
