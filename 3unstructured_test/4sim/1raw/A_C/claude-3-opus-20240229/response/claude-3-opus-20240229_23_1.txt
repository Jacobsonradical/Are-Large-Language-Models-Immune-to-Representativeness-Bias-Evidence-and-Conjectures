Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may share some similarities with computer science graduate students. However, his warm heart, empathy, and love of animals along with his interest in nature and plants seem to align even more closely with the typical profile of an agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.
