Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. 

His quiet nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also suggest some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more his interest in nature and animals over traits like technical aptitude that would be more characteristic of computer science.
