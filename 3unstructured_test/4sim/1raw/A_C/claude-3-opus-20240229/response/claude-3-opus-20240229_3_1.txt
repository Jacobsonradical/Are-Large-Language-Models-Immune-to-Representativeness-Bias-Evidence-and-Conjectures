Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's strong interest in nature, plants and animals, as well as his deep love and empathy for animals, suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. 

His quiet nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also bears some similarity to a stereotypical computer science grad student. However, the personality sketch emphasized more his affinity for nature and animals over technical skills and interests.
