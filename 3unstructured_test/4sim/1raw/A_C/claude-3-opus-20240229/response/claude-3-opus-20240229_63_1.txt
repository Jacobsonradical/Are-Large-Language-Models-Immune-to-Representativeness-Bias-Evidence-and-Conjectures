Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals along with his strong empathy and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science grad student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills and enjoyment of puzzles also align reasonably well with computer science, though perhaps not quite as strongly as with agricultural and veterinary science based on the description provided.
