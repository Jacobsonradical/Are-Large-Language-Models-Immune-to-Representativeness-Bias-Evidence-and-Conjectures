Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals along with his strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science grad student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and puzzle-solving enjoyment also fit that field decently well.

While his intelligence and abstract reasoning abilities would serve him well in computer science, the other traits mentioned are less directly relevant. Problem solving skills broadly apply but a specific mention of math, programming or technical interests would point to a stronger computer science fit. So I estimate he is somewhat similar to a typical CS grad student but not an ideal match based solely on the description.
