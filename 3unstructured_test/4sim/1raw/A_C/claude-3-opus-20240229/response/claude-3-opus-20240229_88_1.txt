Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts could fit well with computer science. However, his personality sketch emphasizes more his love of nature, plants, animals and empathy, which seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. So while he shares some traits with a typical computer science grad student, I believe he is more similar overall to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student based on the description provided.
