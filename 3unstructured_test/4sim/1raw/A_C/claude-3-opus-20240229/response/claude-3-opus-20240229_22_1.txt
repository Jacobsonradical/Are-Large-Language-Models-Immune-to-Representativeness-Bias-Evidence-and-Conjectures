Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts could fit well with either computer science or agricultural/veterinary science. However, the personality sketch emphasizes his curiosity about plants and deep love for animals specifically, which seems more directly relevant to agricultural and veterinary science. So while he could potentially be a good fit for computer science too, I scored his similarity highest for agricultural and veterinary graduate students.
