Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation:
Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his strong empathy suggest he would be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also serve him well in this field.

While Adam's skills at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could translate well to computer science, the personality sketch does not provide strong evidence that he has a passion or aptitude specifically for computers and technology. He may be a reasonable fit for computer science but the description paints him as a better match for agricultural and veterinary science.
