Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could fit the profile of a computer science grad student to some degree. However, his strong empathy, love of animals, and interest in nature and plants seem to align even more closely with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.
