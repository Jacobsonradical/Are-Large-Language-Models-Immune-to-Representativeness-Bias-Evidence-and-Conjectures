Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, seem quite aligned with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also fit the profile of many computer science graduate students. However, the personality sketch emphasizes his connection to nature and animals more than typical computer science traits, so I rated the similarity there slightly lower.
