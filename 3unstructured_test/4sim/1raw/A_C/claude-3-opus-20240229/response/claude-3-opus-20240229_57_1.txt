Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests he may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet nature, puzzle-solving enjoyment, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts also fits the profile of many computer science graduate students. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more of his alignment with agricultural and veterinary science. Of course, this is a simplified assessment based on limited information about Adam's personality.
