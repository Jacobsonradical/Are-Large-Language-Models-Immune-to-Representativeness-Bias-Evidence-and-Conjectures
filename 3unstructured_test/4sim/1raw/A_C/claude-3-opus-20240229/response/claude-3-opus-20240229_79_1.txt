Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts could fit well with computer science. However, his strong empathy, love of animals, and interest in nature and plants seem even more aligned with a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
