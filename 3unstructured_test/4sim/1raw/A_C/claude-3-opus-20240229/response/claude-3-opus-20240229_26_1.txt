Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals along with his strong empathy and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills and enjoyment of puzzles also align somewhat with the profile of a computer science student, but the overall description seems to fit agricultural and veterinary science a bit more closely in my estimation.
