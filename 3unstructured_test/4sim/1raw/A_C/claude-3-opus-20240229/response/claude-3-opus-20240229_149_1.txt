Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature, as well as his appreciation for hard work and dedication, make him seem an even stronger match for agricultural and veterinary science.
