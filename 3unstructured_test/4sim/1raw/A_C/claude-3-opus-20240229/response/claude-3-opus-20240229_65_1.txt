Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's love of solving puzzles and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts suggests he may have some similarities to computer science graduate students. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are traits more typically associated with students of agricultural and veterinary science. So while he has some things in common with CS students, his profile overall seems to align more closely with a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
