Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals along with his strong empathy and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science grad student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills and enjoyment of puzzles also align somewhat with computer science, but the overall profile seems to lean more towards agricultural and veterinary pursuits based on the description provided.
