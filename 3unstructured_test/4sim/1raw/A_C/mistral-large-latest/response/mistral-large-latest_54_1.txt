Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with the skills needed in computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature isn't typically a strong indicator of interest in this field, hence the score of 0.6.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align very well with the traits of a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, hence the score of 0.8.
