Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with the skills needed for computer science. However, his personality sketch does not mention a strong interest in technology or computers specifically, which is why the score is not higher.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align very well with the typical traits of students in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Hence, the higher score.
