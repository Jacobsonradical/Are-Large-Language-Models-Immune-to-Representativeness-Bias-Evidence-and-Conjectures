Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with the skills needed for computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are not typically emphasized in this field.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are very well aligned with the qualities of a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
