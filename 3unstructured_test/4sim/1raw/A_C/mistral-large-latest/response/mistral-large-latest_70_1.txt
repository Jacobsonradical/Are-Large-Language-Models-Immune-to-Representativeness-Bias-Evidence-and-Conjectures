Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with the skills needed in computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are not as typically associated with this field, hence a score of 0.6.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make him very similar to a typical graduate student in this field. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with these fields, hence a score of 0.8.
