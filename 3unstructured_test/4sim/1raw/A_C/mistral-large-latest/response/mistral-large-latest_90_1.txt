Explanation:
- "computer science": Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with the skills needed for computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature is not typically a strong indicator of interest in computer science, hence a score of 0.6.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align very well with the typical traits of a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, hence a score of 0.8.
