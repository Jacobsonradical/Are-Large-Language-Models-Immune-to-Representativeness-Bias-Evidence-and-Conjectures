Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with the skills needed for computer science. However, his personality sketch does not mention a strong interest in technology or computers specifically, which is why the similarity is not closer to 1.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make him very similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with these fields.
