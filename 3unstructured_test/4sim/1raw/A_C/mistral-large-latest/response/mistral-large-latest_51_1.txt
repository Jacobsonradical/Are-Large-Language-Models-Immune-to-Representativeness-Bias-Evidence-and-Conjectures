Explanation:
- "computer science": Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student. However, his deep love for animals and nature is not typically associated with this field, hence a score of 0.6.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align closely with a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, hence a score of 0.8.
