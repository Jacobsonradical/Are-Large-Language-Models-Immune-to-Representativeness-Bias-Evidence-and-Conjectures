  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be a good fit for computer science, his personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and puzzles more than technology or programming. Therefore, he might not be as similar to a typical computer science graduate student, hence the score of 0.6.
