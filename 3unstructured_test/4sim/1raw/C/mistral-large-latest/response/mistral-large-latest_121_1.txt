Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and strong understanding of abstract concepts are traits that many computer science graduate students possess, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his quiet and empathetic nature, are not necessarily typical traits of a computer science graduate student. Therefore, Adam is somewhat similar to a typical computer science graduate student, but not entirely.
