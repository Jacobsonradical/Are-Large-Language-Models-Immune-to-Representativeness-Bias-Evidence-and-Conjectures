  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be similar to a typical graduate student in computer science, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants might be less common in this field. Therefore, a score of 0.6 reflects a balance between these similar and dissimilar traits.
