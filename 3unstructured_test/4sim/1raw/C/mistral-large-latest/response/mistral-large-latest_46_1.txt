  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant to computer science, his personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which are not necessarily indicative of a typical computer science graduate student. Therefore, a score of 0.6 reflects a reasonable similarity but not a perfect match.
