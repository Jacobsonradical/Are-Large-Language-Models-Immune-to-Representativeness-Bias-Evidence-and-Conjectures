  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are traits that are valuable in computer science, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his quiet demeanor, may not be as typical of computer science graduate students. Hence, a score of 0.6 reflects a fairly good fit, but not a perfect one.
