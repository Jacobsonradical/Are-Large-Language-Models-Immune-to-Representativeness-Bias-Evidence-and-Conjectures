  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's strong intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be similar to a typical graduate student in computer science, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and quiet, empathetic nature might be less common in this field. Therefore, a score of 0.6 reflects a fairly good match, but not a perfect one.
