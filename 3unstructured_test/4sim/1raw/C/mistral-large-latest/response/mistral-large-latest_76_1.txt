Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and ability to understand abstract concepts are traits that many computer science graduate students possess, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants are not necessarily typical traits of computer science graduate students. Therefore, he is somewhat similar but not entirely representative of a typical computer science graduate student.
