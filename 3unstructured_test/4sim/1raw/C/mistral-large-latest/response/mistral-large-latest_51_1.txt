  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant to computer science, his personality sketch does not mention a strong interest in technology, programming, or mathematical inclination, which are typically associated with this field.
