  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant to computer science, his personality sketch emphasizes his interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his quiet and empathetic nature, which are not typically strong indicators of a computer science background. Therefore, he is somewhat similar but not a perfect fit, hence the score of 0.6.
