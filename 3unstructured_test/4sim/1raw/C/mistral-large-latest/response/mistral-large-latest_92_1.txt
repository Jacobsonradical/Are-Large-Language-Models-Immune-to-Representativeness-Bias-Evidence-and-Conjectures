Explanation: While Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are traits that many computer science graduate students possess, his personality sketch also emphasizes traits like a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, which are not necessarily typical of computer science graduate students. Therefore, he is somewhat similar but not entirely typical of a computer science graduate student.
