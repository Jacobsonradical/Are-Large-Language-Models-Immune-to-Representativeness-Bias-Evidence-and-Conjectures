Explanation: While Adam's puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align with the traits of a typical computer science graduate student, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants suggest interests that may be more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Therefore, he is somewhat similar to a typical computer science graduate student, but not entirely.
