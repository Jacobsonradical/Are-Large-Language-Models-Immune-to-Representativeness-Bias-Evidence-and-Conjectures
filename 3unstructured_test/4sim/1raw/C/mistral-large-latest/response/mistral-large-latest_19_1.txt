  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are traits that many computer science graduate students possess, his strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature and hard work do not necessarily correlate with the typical computer science graduate student profile. Therefore, a score of 0.6 reflects a fairly good match but not a perfect one.
