Explanation: While Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are traits that many computer science graduate students possess, his personality sketch also emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which are not necessarily typical traits of a computer science graduate student. Therefore, he is somewhat similar but not entirely typical of a computer science graduate student.
