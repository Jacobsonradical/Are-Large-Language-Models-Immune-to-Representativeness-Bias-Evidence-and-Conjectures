{
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant to computer science, his personality sketch does not mention a strong interest in technology, mathematics, or programming, which are typically key aspects of a computer science graduate student. Therefore, he is somewhat similar but not a perfect fit, hence the score of 0.6.
