  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant to computer science, his personality sketch emphasizes his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, which are not typically standout traits for computer science graduate students. Hence, a score of 0.6 reflects a reasonable similarity but not a perfect match.
