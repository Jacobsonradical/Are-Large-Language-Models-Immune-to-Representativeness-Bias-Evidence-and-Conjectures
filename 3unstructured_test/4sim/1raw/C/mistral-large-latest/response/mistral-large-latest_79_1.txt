Explanation: While Adam's problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are traits that are valuable in computer science, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathetic nature, are not typically correlated with the field. Therefore, he is somewhat similar to a typical graduate student in computer science, but not entirely.
