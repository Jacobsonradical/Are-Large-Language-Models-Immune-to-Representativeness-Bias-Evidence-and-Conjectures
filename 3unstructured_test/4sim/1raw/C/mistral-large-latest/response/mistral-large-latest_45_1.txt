  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are traits that are valuable in computer science, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his quiet and empathetic nature, are not typically correlated with the stereotypical computer science graduate student. Therefore, he is somewhat similar but not a perfect fit, hence the score of 0.6.
