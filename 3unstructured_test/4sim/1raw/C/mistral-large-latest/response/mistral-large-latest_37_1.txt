  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be aligned with traits of a typical computer science graduate student, his personality sketch does not mention a strong interest in technology, mathematics, or programming, which are core aspects of computer science. Therefore, he is not a perfect fit for the typical computer science graduate student profile, hence the score of 0.6.
