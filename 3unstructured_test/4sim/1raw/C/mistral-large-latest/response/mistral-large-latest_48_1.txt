{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and puzzle-solving skills might correlate with traits found in computer science graduate students, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy, might be less typical in this field. Therefore, a score of 0.6 reflects a balance between these matching and differing traits.
