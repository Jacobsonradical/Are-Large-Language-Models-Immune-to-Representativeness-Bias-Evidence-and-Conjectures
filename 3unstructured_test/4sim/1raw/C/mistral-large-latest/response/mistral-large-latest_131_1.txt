  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with the field of computer science, his strong affinity for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his quiet demeanor, might be less typical among computer science graduate students. Hence, a score of 0.6 reflects a fairly good fit but not a perfect one.
