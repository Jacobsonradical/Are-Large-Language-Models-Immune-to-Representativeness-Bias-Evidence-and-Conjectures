{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant to computer science, his personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which are not necessarily core traits of a typical computer science graduate student. Therefore, he is somewhat similar but not a perfect fit, hence the score of 0.6.
