Explanation: While Adam's problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are well-suited to computer science, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants suggest interests that are more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science. Therefore, he is somewhat similar to a typical graduate student in computer science, but not extremely so.
