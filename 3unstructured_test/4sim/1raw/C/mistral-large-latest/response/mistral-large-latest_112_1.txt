  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be similar to a typical graduate student in computer science, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his quiet and empathetic nature, might be less common in this field. Therefore, a score of 0.6 reflects a balance between these similar and different traits.
