{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are traits that are valuable in computer science, his strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature and hard work do not necessarily correlate with the typical profile of a computer science graduate student. Therefore, he is somewhat similar but not a perfect fit, hence the score of 0.6.
