  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are traits that many computer science graduate students possess, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his quiet demeanor, may be less typical of the field. Therefore, a score of 0.6 reflects a fairly good match, but not a perfect one.
