  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant in computer science, his personality sketch does not mention a strong interest in technology, programming, or mathematical problem-solving, which are typically associated with this field. Therefore, he might not be a perfect fit for a typical computer science graduate student, hence the score of 0.6.
