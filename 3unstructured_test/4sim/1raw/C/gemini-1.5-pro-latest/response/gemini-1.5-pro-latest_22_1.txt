  "computer science": "0.6" 
} 

**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality reveals several traits often found in computer science graduate students:

* **High intelligence:**  Important for the demanding nature of the field.
* **Enjoys solving puzzles:**  Aligns with the problem-solving aspects of computer science.
* **Understanding abstract concepts:**  Crucial for grasping programming and theoretical computer science. 

Some aspects are less typical:

* **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants:** While not unheard of, this interest isn't a strong indicator of affinity for computer science.
* **Quiet and empathetic:** These traits are not as directly relevant to the field compared to logical thinking and problem-solving. 

Therefore, a score of 0.6 reflects a moderate similarity to a typical computer science graduate student. Adam possesses some key characteristics but also displays interests that might be more common in other fields like biology or environmental science.
