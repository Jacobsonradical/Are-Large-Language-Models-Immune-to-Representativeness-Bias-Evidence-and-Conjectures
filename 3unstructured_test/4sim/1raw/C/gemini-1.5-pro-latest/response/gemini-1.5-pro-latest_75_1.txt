{
  "computer science": "0.6"
} 

**Explanation:**

While Adam's personality traits like high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with a typical computer science graduate student, some aspects make him moderately similar:

* **Curiosity about nature and love for animals:**  These are not traits typically associated with computer science students, though not unheard of.
* **Quiet and empathetic:** While some computer science students may be introverted and empathetic, these traits are not defining characteristics of the field. 

Therefore, a score of 0.6 represents a moderate similarity. He possesses some key traits but also some that are less common in the field.
