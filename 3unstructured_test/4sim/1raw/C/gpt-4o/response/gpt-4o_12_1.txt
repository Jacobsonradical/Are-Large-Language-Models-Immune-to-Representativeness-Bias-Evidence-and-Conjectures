Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and curiosity align well with the attributes commonly found in computer science graduate students. His enjoyment of solving puzzles also suggests he could be drawn to problem-solving tasks prevalent in the field. The only aspect that doesn't strongly align is his deep love for nature and animals, but that doesn't significantly diminish his similarity to a typical computer science graduate student.
