Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work align well with the typical characteristics of a computer science graduate student. Moreover, his enjoyment of solving puzzles is a trait that is commonly beneficial in the field of computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature, as well as his strong empathy, may not be as directly relevant to the usual profile of a computer science student, which prevents giving a perfect score.
