Explanation: Computer science graduate students often possess high intelligence and a knack for understanding abstract concepts, much like Adam. Additionally, problem-solving skills are crucial in this field, aligning with Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles. However, Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants may point more towards fields like biology or environmental science. Hence, while there are significant overlaps, the fit is not perfect, leading to a score of 0.7.
