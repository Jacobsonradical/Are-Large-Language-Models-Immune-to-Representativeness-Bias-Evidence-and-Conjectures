  "computer science": 0.6
}

Adam possesses traits that align with characteristics often found in graduate students of computer science, such as high intelligence, strong problem-solving skills (enjoying puzzles suggests this), and an appreciation for abstract concepts. However, his deep curiosity about nature and love for animals might be less common among computer science graduate students, who might be more focused on technology and computational topics. Thus, a moderate similarity score of 0.6 is appropriate.
