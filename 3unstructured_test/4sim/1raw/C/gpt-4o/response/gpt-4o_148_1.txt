Explanation: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills typically needed for a graduate student in computer science. His enjoyment of solving puzzles also indicates a natural aptitude for problem-solving, which is crucial in this field. However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals might be less common attributes among typical computer science graduate students, but not irrelevant to the field if applied in contexts like AI ethics or bioinformatics.
