Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could align well with studying computer science. However, the personality sketch emphasizes his love of nature, animals, and empathy more than technical skills or interests, so he may not be the most typical computer science graduate student in those respects.
