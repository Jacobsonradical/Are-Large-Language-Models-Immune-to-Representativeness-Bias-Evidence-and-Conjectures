Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's quiet nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could be a reasonably good fit for computer science. However, the sketch emphasizes his love of nature, animals, and empathy more than technical skills or interests. So while he shares some traits with a stereotypical CS student, he does not appear to be an extremely close match overall based on the limited information provided.
