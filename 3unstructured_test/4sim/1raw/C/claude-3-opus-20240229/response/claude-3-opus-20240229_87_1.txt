Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are quite relevant to computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, animals, and empathy are less typical for this field. So I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science grad student to be moderately high, around 0.6 on a 0 to 1 scale.
