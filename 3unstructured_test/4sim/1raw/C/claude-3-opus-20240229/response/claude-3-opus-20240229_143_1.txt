Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could be a reasonable fit for computer science. However, the sketch emphasizes his love of nature, animals, and empathy more than traits commonly associated with computer science. Therefore, I estimate a moderate similarity of 0.6 out of 1.
