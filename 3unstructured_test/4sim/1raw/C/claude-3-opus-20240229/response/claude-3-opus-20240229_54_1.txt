Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, the personality sketch emphasizes his curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love of animals, which are less directly relevant to computer science. Of course, graduate students in any field can have diverse interests. But based solely on the given description, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science graduate student as a 0.6 out of 1.
