Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

While the personality sketch does not directly mention computer science or technical skills, it does indicate that Adam has high intelligence, is good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits are common among computer science students. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's curiosity about nature, love of animals, and strong empathy, which are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science graduate student as 0.7 on a 0 to 1 scale.
