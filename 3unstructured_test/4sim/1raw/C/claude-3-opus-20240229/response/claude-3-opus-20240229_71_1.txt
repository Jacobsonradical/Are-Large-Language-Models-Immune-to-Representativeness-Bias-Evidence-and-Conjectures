Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits are common among computer science students. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, which are less stereotypical traits for computer science. Therefore, I rate the similarity as 0.6 out of 1.
