Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, the sketch does not mention specific technical skills or a strong interest in technology, programming, or computing, which are more typical of computer science students. His deep interest in nature, plants and animals is less common among computer science students. So while he has some relevant traits, he also differs from the typical graduate student in this field in some ways. Therefore, I rate the similarity as 0.6 out of 1.
