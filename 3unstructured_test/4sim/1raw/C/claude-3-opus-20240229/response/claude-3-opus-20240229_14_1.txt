Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could align well with a computer science graduate student. However, the subject's strong interest in nature, animals, and puzzles is less typical of computer science students compared to some other fields. Therefore, I estimate a similarity of 0.6 out of 1.0 compared to a typical computer science grad student.
