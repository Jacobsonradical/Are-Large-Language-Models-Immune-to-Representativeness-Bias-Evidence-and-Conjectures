Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has high intelligence, is good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits align reasonably well with skills that are useful in computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's love of nature, plants, animals and his strong empathy, which are less directly relevant to computer science. Therefore, I estimate a similarity of 0.6 out of 1 to a typical computer science graduate student.
