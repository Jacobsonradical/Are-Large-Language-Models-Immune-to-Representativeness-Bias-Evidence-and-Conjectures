Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While some traits like high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are common among computer science graduate students, other traits like genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals are less typical in my estimation. Problem solving skills are valuable in computer science. Overall, I would judge Adam to be moderately similar to the average computer science grad student based on the description provided, but not an extremely close match, so I have assigned a similarity score of 0.6.
