Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are quite common among computer science graduate students. However, the strong interest in nature and love of animals is less typical for this field compared to some others. So I rate the overall similarity as moderately high, assigning a score of 0.6 on a 0 to 1 scale.
