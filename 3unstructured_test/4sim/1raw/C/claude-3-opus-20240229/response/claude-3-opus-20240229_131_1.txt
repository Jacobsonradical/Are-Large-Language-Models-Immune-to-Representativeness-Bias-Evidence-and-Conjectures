Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While some traits like high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science, other aspects like curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and deep love of animals are less typical of computer science graduate students in my estimation. So I rate the overall similarity as 0.6 on a 0 to 1 scale.
