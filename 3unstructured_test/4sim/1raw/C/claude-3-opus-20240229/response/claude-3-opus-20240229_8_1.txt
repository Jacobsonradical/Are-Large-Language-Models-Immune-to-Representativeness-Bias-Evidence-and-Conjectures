Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles would align reasonably well with skills needed for graduate study in computer science. However, the personality sketch does not specifically mention an interest or aptitude in technology, programming, or mathematics, which are also important for computer science. The description of Adam as having curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and a love for animals suggests his interests may align more with other fields. Therefore, I estimate a similarity of 0.6 out of 1 to a typical computer science graduate student.
