Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are quite consistent with a typical computer science graduate student. However, the strong interest in nature and plants, as well as the deep love for animals, are less typical traits for this field. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a computer science graduate student as 0.6 on a 0 to 1 scale.
