Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could align well with computer science. However, the personality sketch does not specifically mention an interest or aptitude for technology, math, or programming, which are more typical traits of computer science students. His love of nature and animals is also not a strong match for the field. Therefore, I rate the similarity as 0.6 out of 1.
