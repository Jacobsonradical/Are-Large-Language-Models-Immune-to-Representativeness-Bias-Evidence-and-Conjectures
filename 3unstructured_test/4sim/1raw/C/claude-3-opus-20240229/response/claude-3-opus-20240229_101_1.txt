Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and grasp of abstract concepts could align well with a computer science student. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less typical of computer science and may point to other fields. So I estimate a similarity of 0.6 out of 1.0 to a typical computer science grad student profile.
