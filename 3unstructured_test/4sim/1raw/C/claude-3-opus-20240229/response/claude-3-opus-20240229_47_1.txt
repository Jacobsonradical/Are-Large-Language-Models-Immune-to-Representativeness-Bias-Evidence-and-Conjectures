Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, on a scale from 0 to 1:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has some traits that could align with computer science such as enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and being good at understanding abstract concepts. However, the sketch also emphasizes his love of nature, animals and strong empathy, which are less stereotypically associated with computer science. So while there is some overlap, I don't see him as an extremely close match to the typical profile, hence my similarity estimate of 0.6.
