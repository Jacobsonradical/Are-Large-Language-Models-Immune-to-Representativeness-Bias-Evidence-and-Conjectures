Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and appreciation for hard work would serve him well in computer science, his specific interests in nature, animals, and puzzles are less directly relevant to this field compared to some others. However, a curious and analytical mind is certainly an asset for computer science. So I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science grad student is moderately above average, at 0.6 out of 1.
