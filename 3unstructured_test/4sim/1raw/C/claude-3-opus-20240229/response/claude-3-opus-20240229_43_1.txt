Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him well-suited for graduate studies in computer science. However, the sketch does not specifically mention an interest or aptitude for programming, math, or technology, which are key traits for this field. His other traits like empathy and love of nature and animals, while admirable, are less directly relevant to computer science. So I estimate a similarity of 0.6 out of 1 compared to a typical computer science grad student.
