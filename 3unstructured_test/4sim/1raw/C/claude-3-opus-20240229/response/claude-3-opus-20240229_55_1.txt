Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam has some traits that could align with computer science such as high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, the sketch does not mention a specific aptitude or interest in computers, programming, or technology. His curiosity seems more focused on nature and plants. So while there is some overlap, he does not appear to be a quintessential match for the typical computer science graduate student based solely on the information provided.
