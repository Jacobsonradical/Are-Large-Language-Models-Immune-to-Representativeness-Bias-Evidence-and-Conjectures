Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, on a scale from 0 to 1:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has some traits that could fit well with computer science, such as being good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoying solving puzzles. His high intelligence would also be an asset. However, the sketch emphasizes more his interest in nature, plants, animals and his empathetic personality, which are less directly relevant to computer science. So while he has some similarities, I would put him only moderately similar overall to the typical computer science grad student profile.
