Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could align well with computer science, his strong interests in nature, animals, and empathy are less typical of computer science graduate students compared to some other fields. So I would estimate a similarity of 0.6 out of 1.0 between Adam and a typical computer science grad student, based on the information given.
