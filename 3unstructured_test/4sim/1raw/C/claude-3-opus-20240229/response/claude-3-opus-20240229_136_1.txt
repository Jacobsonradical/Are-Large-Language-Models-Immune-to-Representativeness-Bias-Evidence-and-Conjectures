Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could do well in computer science. However, the personality sketch does not mention a specific interest or aptitude in technology, programming, or mathematics, which are more directly relevant to computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants, while a positive trait, is less directly applicable. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science graduate student as a 0.6 out of 1.
