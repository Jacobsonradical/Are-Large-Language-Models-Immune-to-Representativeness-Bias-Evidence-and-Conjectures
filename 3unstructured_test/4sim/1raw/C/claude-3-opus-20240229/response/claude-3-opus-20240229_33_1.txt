Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam has traits that could align with computer science such as high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, the sketch also emphasizes his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, which are less stereotypically associated with computer science. So I estimate he has a moderate level of similarity to the typical computer science grad student archetype.
