Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's quiet nature, curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could align well with computer science. However, the personality sketch does not directly mention an interest or skills in technology, math, or programming, which are more typical of computer science students. His strong empathy and love of nature and animals are less commonly emphasized traits for this field. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science graduate student as a 0.6 out of 1.
