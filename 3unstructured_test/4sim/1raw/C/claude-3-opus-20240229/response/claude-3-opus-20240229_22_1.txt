Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's quiet nature, love of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts suggest he may share some similarities with graduate students in computer science. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, animals and his deep empathy are less typical traits for that field. So I estimate a moderate similarity of 0.6 out of 1.
