Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's quiet nature, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and strong work ethic seem like qualities that would be common among computer science graduate students. However, the personality sketch emphasizes his curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, and strong empathy, which are not stereotypically associated with computer science. So while there is some overlap, he does not seem like a very typical computer science student based on the limited information provided.
