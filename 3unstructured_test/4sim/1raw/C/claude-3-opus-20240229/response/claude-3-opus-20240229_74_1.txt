Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While some aspects of Adam's personality align with computer science such as high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts, other key traits are missing from the description that would be more typical of computer science students, such as a strong interest in technology, programming, and logical problem-solving. The focus on curiosity about nature, love of animals, and strong empathy suggest his interests and personality may align better with other fields. However, without more information it's difficult to assess fit conclusively. The 0.6 value represents a moderate but not extremely strong similarity to the typical computer science graduate student profile based on the details provided.
