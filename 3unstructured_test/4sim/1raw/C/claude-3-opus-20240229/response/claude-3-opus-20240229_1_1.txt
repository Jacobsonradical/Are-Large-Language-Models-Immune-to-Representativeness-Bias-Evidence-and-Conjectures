Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could align well with computer science. However, the personality sketch does not directly mention technical skills or specific interest in computers or programming. His empathy and love of nature and animals are not as directly relevant to computer science. So while there is some overlap, he doesn't seem to be a quintessential match for the field based on the given information.
