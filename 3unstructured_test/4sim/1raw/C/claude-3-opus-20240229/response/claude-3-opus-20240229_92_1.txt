Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are qualities that would align well with a typical computer science graduate student. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's strong empathy, love of nature and animals, and quiet demeanor, which are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science grad student as 0.6 out of 1.
