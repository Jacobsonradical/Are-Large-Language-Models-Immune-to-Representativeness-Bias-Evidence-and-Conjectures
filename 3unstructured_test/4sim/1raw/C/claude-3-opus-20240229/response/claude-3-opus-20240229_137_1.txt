Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he may share some traits with typical computer science graduate students. However, the personality sketch emphasizes his love of nature, animals, and his strong empathy, which are not stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, I estimate a similarity of 0.6 out of 1.0, indicating he has some key traits in common with the typical graduate student in this field but also some notable differences.
