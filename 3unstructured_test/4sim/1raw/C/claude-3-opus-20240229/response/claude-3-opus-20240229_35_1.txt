Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, the sketch emphasizes his curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, and strong empathy, which are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, I estimate he is moderately similar to a typical computer science grad student, but not an ideal match based solely on the information provided.
