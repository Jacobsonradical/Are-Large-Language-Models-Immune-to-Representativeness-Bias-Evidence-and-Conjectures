Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking ability, and strong work ethic are quite compatible with a typical computer science graduate student. However, the strong interest in nature, animals, and empathy are less typical for this field, though certainly possible. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science grad student to be around 0.6 on a 0 to 1 scale.
