Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are quite common among computer science graduate students. However, the strong interest in nature and plants, love for animals, and high empathy are less typical traits for this field, though certainly not unheard of. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science grad student as 0.6 out of 1.
