Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While some traits like high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could align well with computer science, other aspects like curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and love of animals seem less typical for that field. So I estimate Adam's similarity to the average computer science grad student is around 0.6 out of 1.
