Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's quiet nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could align well with a typical computer science graduate student. However, the sketch emphasizes his love of nature, animals, and strong empathy, which are not stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, I estimate a similarity of 0.6 out of 1.0, indicating moderate similarity to a typical computer science graduate student based on the limited information provided.
