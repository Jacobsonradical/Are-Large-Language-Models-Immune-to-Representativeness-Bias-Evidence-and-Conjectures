Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could be a reasonably good fit for graduate studies in computer science. However, the sketch does not mention specific technical skills or a particular passion for computing that would indicate a very close match to the typical computer science graduate student. His other traits like curiosity about nature, empathy and love of animals, while positive attributes, are not as directly relevant to graduate studies in computer science.
