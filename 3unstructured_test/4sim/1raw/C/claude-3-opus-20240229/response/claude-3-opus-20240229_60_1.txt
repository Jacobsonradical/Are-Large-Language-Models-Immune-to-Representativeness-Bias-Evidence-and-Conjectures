Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could align well with a typical computer science graduate student. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and warm empathy are less typical traits for that field, so I would assess the overall similarity as moderate, around 0.6 on a 0 to 1 scale.
