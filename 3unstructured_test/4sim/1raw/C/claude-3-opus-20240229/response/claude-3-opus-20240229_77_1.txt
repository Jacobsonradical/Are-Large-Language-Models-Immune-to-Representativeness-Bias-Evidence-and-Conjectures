Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are quite common among computer science graduate students. However, the strong interest in nature and plants, as well as the deep love for animals, are less typical traits for this field. So I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science grad student as moderately high, but not extremely high, hence the score of 0.6 out of 1.
