Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and appreciation for hard work would serve him well in computer science, his personality traits don't strongly align with the stereotypical computer science student. His love of nature, animals, and puzzles suggest interests beyond just technology and programming. However, computer science does require strong problem-solving skills which Adam seems to possess. So I'd say there is a moderate similarity of 0.6 out of 1 between Adam and a typical computer science grad student based on the information provided.
