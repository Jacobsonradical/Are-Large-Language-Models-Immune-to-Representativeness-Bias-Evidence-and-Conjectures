Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he may share some qualities with computer science graduate students. However, the sketch emphasizes his love of nature, animals, and his strong empathy, which are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, I estimate a moderate similarity of 0.6 out of 1.
