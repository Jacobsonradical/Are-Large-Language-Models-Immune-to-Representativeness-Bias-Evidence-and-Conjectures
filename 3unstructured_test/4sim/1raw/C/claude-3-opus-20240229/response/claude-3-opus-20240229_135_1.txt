Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation of hard work and dedication are quite common among computer science graduate students. However, the strong interest in nature and plants, love of animals, and warm empathetic personality are less stereotypical traits for that field, though of course there is plenty of individual variation. Therefore, I would assess Adam's overall similarity to a typical computer science grad student as moderately high, around 0.6 on a 0 to 1 scale.
