Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are quite common among computer science graduate students. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's love of nature, animals, and his strong empathy, which are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, I rate the overall similarity as 0.6 out of 1.
