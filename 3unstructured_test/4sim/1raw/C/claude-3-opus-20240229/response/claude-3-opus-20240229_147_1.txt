Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could make him well-suited for computer science. However, the sketch emphasizes his love of nature, animals, and empathy more than technical skills or interests that are common in computer science. So while there is some potential overlap, I don't see him as an extremely close fit to the typical computer science graduate student profile based on the information provided.
