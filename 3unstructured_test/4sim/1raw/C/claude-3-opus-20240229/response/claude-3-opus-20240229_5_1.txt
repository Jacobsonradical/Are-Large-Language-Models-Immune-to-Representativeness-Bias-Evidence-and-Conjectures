Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are qualities that would serve him well as a computer science graduate student. However, the personality sketch does not specifically mention an interest or aptitude for technology, programming, or mathematics, which are more directly relevant to computer science. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science graduate student as 0.6 out of 1.
