Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, the sketch emphasizes his love of nature, animals, and empathy more than typical traits associated with computer science like a strong interest in technology and building systems. So while there is some overlap, I don't see him as an extremely close match to the typical computer science graduate student based on the information provided.
