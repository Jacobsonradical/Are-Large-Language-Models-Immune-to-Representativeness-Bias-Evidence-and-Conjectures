Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While some aspects of Adam's personality align with traits that may be common among computer science graduate students, such as high intelligence, enjoying solving puzzles, and being good at understanding abstract concepts, other traits mentioned are less directly relevant to this field. His strong interest in nature and animals, and emphasis on empathy and having a warm heart, while positive attributes, are not as strongly associated with the typical profile of a computer science graduate student.
