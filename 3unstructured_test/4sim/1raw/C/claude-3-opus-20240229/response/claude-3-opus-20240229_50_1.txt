Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While some traits like high intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and dedication are common among computer science graduate students, other aspects like curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love of animals are less typical. Problem solving skills are relevant but the type of puzzles aren't specified. So I'd estimate a moderate similarity of 0.6 out of 1 to a typical computer science grad student profile based on the information provided.
