Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and appreciation for hard work could suit him well for graduate studies in computer science, his strong interests in nature, animals, and puzzles are less typical of computer science students compared to some other fields. His quiet personality also differs somewhat from the stereotype of computer science students being more outgoing. So I estimate a similarity of 0.6 out of 1.0 to the typical computer science grad student.
