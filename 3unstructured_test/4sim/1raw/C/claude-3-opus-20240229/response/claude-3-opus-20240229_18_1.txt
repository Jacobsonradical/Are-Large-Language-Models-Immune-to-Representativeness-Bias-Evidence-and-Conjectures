Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The traits of curiosity, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could align well with computer science. However, the strong interest in nature/plants and love of animals are less typical for this field. Overall, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science graduate student to be around 0.6 on a 0 to 1 scale.
