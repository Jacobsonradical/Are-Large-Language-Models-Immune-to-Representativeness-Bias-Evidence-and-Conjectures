Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"

While Adam's intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and dedication would serve him well in computer science, his specific interests in nature, animals, and puzzles are less directly relevant to the typical computer science graduate student. However, strong problem solving skills and work ethic are certainly assets in this field.
