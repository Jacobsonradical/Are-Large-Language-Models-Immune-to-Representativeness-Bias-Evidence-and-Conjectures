Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would serve him well as a computer science graduate student, his personality sketch does not strongly indicate the typical traits and interests of someone in that field, such as a passion for technology, programming, or mathematics. His love of nature, animals, and puzzles suggests he may be a better fit for a field like biology or veterinary medicine. However, it's certainly possible for him to apply his intellectual abilities to computer science even if it doesn't perfectly match his innate interests and personality. Therefore, I rate the similarity as 0.6 out of 1.
