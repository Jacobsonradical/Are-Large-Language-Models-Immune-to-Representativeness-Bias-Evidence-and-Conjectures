Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While some aspects of Adam's personality align with stereotypical traits of computer science students, such as enjoying solving puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts, other aspects seem less typical, such as his strong empathy, love of nature and animals. So I estimate he is moderately similar to a typical computer science grad student, but not a perfect match.
