Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While some aspects of Adam's personality align with stereotypical traits of computer science students, such as being intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, other aspects of his personality sketch (genuine curiosity about nature/plants, quiet demeanor, strong empathy, and deep love of animals) are less commonly associated with the field. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science graduate student as 0.6 out of 1.
