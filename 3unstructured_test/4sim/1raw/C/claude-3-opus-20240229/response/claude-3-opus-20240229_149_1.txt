Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could do well in computer science. However, the sketch emphasizes his love of nature, animals, and hard work more than technical skills or interests, so he doesn't perfectly match the stereotypical computer science student profile. Therefore, I rate the similarity as 0.6 out of 1.
