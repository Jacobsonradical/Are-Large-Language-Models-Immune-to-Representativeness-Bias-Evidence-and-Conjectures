Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While some aspects of Adam's personality align with traits that may be common among computer science students, such as high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, other aspects like his curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals seem less typical for this field. Therefore, I rate the similarity as 0.6, indicating he has some similarities but also notable differences from the average computer science graduate student.
