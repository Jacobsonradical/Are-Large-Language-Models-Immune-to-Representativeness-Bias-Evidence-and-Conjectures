Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"

While some aspects of Adam's personality align with stereotypical traits of computer science students, such as being intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, other aspects of his personality seem less typical, such as his strong curiosity about nature and plants, and his deep love for animals. Overall, I would say Adam's similarity to the average computer science grad student is moderate, around 0.6 on a scale from 0 to 1.
