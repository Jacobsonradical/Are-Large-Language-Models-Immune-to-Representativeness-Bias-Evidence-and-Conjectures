Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The key traits that suggest some similarity to a computer science graduate student are Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles. However, the personality sketch also emphasizes traits less stereotypically associated with computer science such as a love of nature and animals, a warm heart and strong empathy. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science graduate student as 0.6 out of 1.
