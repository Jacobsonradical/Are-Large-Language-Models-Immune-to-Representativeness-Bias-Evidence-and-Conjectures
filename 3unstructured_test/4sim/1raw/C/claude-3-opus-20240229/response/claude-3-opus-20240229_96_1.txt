Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could align well with computer science, the sketch does not mention a specific interest or skills in technology, programming, or mathematics which are more typical of computer science graduate students. His curiosity about nature and plants, and his deep love of animals, are less common traits for this field. So I'd estimate he has a moderate similarity of 0.6 to the typical computer science graduate student profile.
