Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, the sketch does not mention a specific passion for technology, programming, or mathematics, which are common traits among computer science graduate students. His strong empathy and love of nature and animals are less typical for this field. Therefore, I estimate a similarity of 0.6 out of 1 to a typical computer science graduate student based on the information provided.
