Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam exhibits some traits that are common among computer science graduate students, such as high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts. However, the personality sketch also emphasizes Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy, which are less stereotypical traits for computer science students. Therefore, I rate the similarity as 0.6 out of 1.
