Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, on a scale from 0 to 1:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has some traits that could align with computer science such as enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and being good at understanding abstract concepts. However, the description also emphasizes his love of nature, animals, empathy and appreciation for hard work, which are not stereotypically associated with computer science. So while there is some overlap, I don't see him as an extremely close match to the typical graduate student profile in that field. Of course, there is a wide diversity of individuals in every field.
