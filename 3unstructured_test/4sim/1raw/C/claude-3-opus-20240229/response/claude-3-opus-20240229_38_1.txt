Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could align well with computer science, his strong interest in nature, plants and animals is less typical for this field. His quiet demeanor and empathy also don't strongly match the stereotype. So I'd estimate he's moderately similar to a typical CS grad student, but not a perfect match based on the description provided.
