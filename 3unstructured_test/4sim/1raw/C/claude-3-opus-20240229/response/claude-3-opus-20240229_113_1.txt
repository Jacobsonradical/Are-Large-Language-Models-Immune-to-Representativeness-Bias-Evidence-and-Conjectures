Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While some aspects of Adam's personality align with traits that may be common among computer science graduate students, such as high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles, other traits like his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy are less stereotypically associated with this field. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science grad student as 0.6 out of 1.
