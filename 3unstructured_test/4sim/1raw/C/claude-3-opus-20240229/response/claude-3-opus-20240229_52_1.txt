Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam has some traits that could suit computer science such as high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, other aspects of his personality like his curiosity about nature and plants, and his strong empathy and love for animals, are less typical of computer science students. So I believe he has moderate similarity to the typical computer science grad student.
