Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, on a scale from 0 to 1:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam has traits that could align with computer science such as high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, the personality sketch also emphasizes his deep interest in nature, plants, animals and his strong empathy. These latter traits are less stereotypically associated with computer science. So I assess the overall similarity as moderate, assigning a value of 0.6 out of 1.
