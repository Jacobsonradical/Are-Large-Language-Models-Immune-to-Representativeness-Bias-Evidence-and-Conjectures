Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's quiet nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could fit the profile of a computer science graduate student to some degree. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and strong empathy, which are less stereotypically associated with computer science. So I assess the overall similarity as moderate, assigning a score of 0.6 on a 0 to 1 scale.
