Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could align well with studying computer science. However, the personality sketch does not directly mention an interest or aptitude in technology, programming, or mathematics, which are also key traits for this field. His genuine curiosity, appreciation for hard work, and warm empathetic nature, while positive qualities, are not as directly relevant to computer science. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science graduate student as a 0.6 out of 1.
