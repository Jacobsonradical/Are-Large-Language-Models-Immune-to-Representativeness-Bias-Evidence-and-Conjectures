Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While some aspects of Adam's personality align with computer science such as his intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, other traits like his love of nature and animals, quiet demeanor, and strong empathy are less typical of computer science graduate students. So I estimate he is moderately similar, but not a very close match, to the average graduate student in that field.
