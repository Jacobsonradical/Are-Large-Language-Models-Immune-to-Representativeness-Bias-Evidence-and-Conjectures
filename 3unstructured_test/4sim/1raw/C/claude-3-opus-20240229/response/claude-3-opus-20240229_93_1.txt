Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has high intelligence, is good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits align fairly well with skills needed for graduate study in computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's love of nature, animals and strong empathy, which are less directly relevant to computer science. So I estimate a similarity of 0.6 out of 1 to a typical computer science grad student. His overall profile suggests he may be a better fit for other fields that also leverage his naturalist interests and interpersonal strengths.
