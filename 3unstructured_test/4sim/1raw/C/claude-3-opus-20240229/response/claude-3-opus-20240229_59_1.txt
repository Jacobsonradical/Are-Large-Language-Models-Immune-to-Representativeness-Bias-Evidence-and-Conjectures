Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While aspects of Adam's personality such as his high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be a good fit for computer science, other traits like his love of nature, animals, and puzzles are less directly relevant to this field. Therefore, I estimate he has a moderate level of similarity to a typical computer science graduate student.
