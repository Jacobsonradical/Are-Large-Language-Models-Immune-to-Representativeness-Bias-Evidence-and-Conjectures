Here is my assessment of the similarity between Adam and a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could do well in computer science. However, the sketch emphasizes his curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love of animals, which are less directly relevant to computer science. So while he has some similarities to a typical CS grad student, I wouldn't say he's a perfect match based on the information provided.
