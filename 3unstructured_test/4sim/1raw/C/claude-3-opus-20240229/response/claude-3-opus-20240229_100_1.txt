Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could make him a good fit for computer science. However, the personality sketch does not mention a specific interest or aptitude for computers, programming, or technology, which are key traits for this field. His love of nature and animals seems to point more toward the life sciences. Therefore, I rate the similarity as 0.6 out of 1 - there are some relevant qualities but also some that seem less aligned with a typical computer science graduate student.
