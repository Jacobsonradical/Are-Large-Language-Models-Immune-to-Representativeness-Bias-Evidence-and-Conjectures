Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could be a decent fit for computer science. However, the sketch emphasizes more his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work, which are less directly relevant to computer science. So while he has some similarities, he doesn't appear to be a quintessential computer science student based on the description provided.
