Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts could align well with computer science. However, the strong empathy, love of animals and nature is less typical of computer science students, so I would assess the overall similarity as moderately above average, but not extremely high.
