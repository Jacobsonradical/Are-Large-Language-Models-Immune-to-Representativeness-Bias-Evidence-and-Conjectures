Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could align well with computer science, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals is less typical of graduate students in that field. His warm heart and strong empathy also don't strongly correlate with the stereotype of a computer science student. So I assess his similarity as moderately above average but not extremely high.
