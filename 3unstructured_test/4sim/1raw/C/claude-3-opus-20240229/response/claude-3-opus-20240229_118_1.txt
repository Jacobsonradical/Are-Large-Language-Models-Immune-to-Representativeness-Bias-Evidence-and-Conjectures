Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could align well with computer science. However, the personality sketch does not specifically mention an interest or aptitude for technology, math, or programming, which are more typical traits of computer science students. His strong empathy and love of nature and animals are less common among computer science students. So I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science grad student as a 0.6 out of 1.
