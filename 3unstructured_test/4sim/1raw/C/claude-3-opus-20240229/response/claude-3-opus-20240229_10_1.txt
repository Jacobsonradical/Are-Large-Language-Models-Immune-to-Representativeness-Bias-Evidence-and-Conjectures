Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are quite relevant to computer science. However, the strong empathy, love of nature and animals, and quiet demeanor solving puzzles are less stereotypical of computer science students, so I rated the overall similarity as 0.6 out of 1.
