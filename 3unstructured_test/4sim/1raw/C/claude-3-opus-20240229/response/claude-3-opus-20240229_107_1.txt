Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could align well with computer science. However, the personality sketch does not directly mention an aptitude or interest in mathematics, programming, or technology, which are key traits for this field. Therefore, I estimate a similarity of 0.6 out of 1 compared to a typical computer science graduate student.
