Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and interest in puzzle-solving align fairly well with traits that would be beneficial for computer science. However, the personality sketch does not specifically mention an interest or aptitude for technology, math, or programming. His strong interest in nature and love of animals also seem less directly relevant to computer science. So while there is some similarity, I would not say Adam's profile is an extremely close match to the typical computer science graduate student based on the information provided.
