Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving ability, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts could align fairly well with a typical computer science graduate student. However, the strong interest in nature, plants and animals is less typical for that field, so I would estimate Adam's similarity to a computer science grad student to be around 0.6 on a 0 to 1 scale.
