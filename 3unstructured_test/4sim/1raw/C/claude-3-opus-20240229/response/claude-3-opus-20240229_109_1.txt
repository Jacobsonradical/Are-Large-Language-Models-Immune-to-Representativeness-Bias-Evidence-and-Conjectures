Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"

While Adam's intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and puzzle-solving interest could align with computer science, his strong love of nature, animals, and apparent biological curiosity seem less typical of computer science students. However, there is certainly individual variation and his overall profile suggests he could potentially pursue graduate studies in a technical field like computer science.
