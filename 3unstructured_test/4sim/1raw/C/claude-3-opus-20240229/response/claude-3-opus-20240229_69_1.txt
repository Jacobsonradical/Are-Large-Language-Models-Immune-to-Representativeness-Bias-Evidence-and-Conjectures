Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's quiet nature, love of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could align well with computer science. However, the sketch emphasizes his curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love of animals, which are not as directly relevant to the typical computer science student. Therefore, I estimate a similarity of 0.6 out of 1.
