Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he may share some qualities with typical computer science graduate students. However, the sketch does not directly mention an interest or skills in programming, mathematics, or technology, which are more central to computer science. His strong curiosity and dedication could be applicable to many fields of graduate study. So while there is some potential overlap, I do not see him as an extremely close match to the typical computer science graduate student profile based solely on the given information.
