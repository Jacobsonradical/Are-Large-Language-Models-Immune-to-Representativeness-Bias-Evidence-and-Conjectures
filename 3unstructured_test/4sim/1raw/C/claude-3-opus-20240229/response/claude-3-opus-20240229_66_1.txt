Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While some traits like high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are common among computer science graduate students, other aspects like curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals are less typical. The personality sketch portrays a more well-rounded individual with diverse interests beyond just computer science. So I would assess the similarity as moderate, around 0.6 out of 1.
