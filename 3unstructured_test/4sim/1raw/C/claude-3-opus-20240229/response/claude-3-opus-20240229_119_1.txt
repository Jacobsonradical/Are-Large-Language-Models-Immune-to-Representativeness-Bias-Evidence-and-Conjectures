Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding of abstract concepts could align well with a computer science student. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy are less typical of computer science in particular, so I would estimate a moderate similarity of 0.6 out of 1.
