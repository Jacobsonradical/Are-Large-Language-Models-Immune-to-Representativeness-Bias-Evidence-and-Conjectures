Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could align well with a typical computer science graduate student. However, the strong interest in nature and plants, love for animals, and warm empathetic personality are less typical of computer science students in my estimation. Of course, any individual can have a wide range of interests and personality traits. But based solely on the given description, I assess Adam's similarity to a typical computer science grad student as moderately above average, or around 0.6 on a 0 to 1 scale.
