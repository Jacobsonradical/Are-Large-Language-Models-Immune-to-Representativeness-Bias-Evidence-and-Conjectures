Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and facility with abstract concepts are quite consistent with a typical computer science graduate student. However, the strong interest in nature and plants, as well as the deep love for animals, are less typical for this field. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science grad student as 0.6 out of 1.0.
