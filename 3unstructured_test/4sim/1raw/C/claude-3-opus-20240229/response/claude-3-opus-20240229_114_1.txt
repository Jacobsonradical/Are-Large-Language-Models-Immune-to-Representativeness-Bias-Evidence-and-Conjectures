Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has high intelligence, is good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits are common among computer science graduate students. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, which are less typical traits for computer science students. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science graduate student as 0.6 on a scale from 0 to 1.
