Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's quiet nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may share some qualities with typical computer science graduate students. However, the sketch emphasizes his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy, which are not stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, I estimate a similarity of 0.6 out of 1.
