Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While some traits like high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are common among computer science graduate students, other aspects of Adam's personality like his strong empathy, love of nature and animals, and quiet demeanor solving puzzles are less stereotypical for that field. So I estimate he has a moderate level of similarity overall to a typical computer science grad student.
