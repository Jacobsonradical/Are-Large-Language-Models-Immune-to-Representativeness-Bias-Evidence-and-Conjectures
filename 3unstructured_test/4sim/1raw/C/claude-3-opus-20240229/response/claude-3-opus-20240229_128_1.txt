Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could align well with computer science. However, the personality sketch does not specifically mention technical skills or interests that are typical of computer science students. His love of nature, animals, and puzzles suggests broad interests beyond just computer science.
