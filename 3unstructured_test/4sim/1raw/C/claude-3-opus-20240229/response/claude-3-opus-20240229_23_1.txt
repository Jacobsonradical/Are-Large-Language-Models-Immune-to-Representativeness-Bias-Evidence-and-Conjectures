Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam has some traits that could align with computer science such as high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles, other aspects of his personality like his curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals are less typical of computer science students. So I estimate he has a moderate similarity of 0.6 to a typical computer science grad student.
