Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While some aspects of Adam's personality align with stereotypical traits of computer science students, such as high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, other aspects of his personality like his strong empathy, love of nature and animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, I rate the overall similarity as 0.6 out of 1.
