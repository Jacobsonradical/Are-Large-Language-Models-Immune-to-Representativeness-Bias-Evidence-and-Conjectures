Here is my assessment of the similarity between Adam and a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

While the personality sketch does not directly mention computer science or technology, it does highlight Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles. These traits are often found in those who excel in computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's love of nature, animals, and his strong empathy, which are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, I estimate a similarity of 0.7 out of 1 between Adam and a typical computer science graduate student, based on the information provided.
