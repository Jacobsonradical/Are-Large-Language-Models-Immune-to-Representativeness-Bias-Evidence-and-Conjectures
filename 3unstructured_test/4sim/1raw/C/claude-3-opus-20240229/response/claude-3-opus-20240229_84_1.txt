Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, the sketch emphasizes more his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and strong empathy, which are less directly relevant to computer science. So I estimate he is moderately similar to a typical computer science grad student, but not an ideal match based solely on the given description.
