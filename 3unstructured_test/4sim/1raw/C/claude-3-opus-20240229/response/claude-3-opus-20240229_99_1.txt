Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are quite compatible with a typical computer science graduate student. However, the strong interest in nature and animals is less typical of this field, so I assess the overall similarity as moderately high but not extremely high.
