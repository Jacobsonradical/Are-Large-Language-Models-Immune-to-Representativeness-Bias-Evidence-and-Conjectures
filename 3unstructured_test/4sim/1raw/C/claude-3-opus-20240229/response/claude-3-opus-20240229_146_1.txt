Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and appreciation for hard work would serve him well as a computer science graduate student, his strong interests in nature, animals, and empathy are less typical for that field. Computer science graduate students tend to be more focused on technology, programming, and mathematical problem-solving. So while there is some overlap, Adam's profile is only moderately similar overall to the average computer science grad student, in my estimation.
