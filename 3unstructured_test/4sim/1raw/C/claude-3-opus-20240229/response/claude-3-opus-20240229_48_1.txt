Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, the personality sketch does not directly mention an interest or aptitude in mathematics, programming, or technology, which are key traits for this field. His curiosity about nature and plants, while a positive trait, is less directly relevant. Therefore, I estimate a similarity of 0.6 out of 1 to a typical computer science graduate student.
