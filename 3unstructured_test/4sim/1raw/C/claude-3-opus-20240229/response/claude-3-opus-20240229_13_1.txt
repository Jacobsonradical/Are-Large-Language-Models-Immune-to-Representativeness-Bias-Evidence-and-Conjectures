Here is my estimate of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts are quite common among computer science students. However, a strong interest in nature and plants, a warm heart, and a deep love for animals are less typical traits for this field. So I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science grad student as moderate, around 0.6 on a 0 to 1 scale.
