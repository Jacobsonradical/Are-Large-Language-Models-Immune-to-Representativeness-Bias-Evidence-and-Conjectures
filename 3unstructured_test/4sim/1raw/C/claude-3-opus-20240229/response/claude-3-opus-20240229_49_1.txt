Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding of abstract concepts could align well with a computer science student. However, the strong emphasis on empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for nature is less typical of computer science in particular, compared to some other fields. So I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science grad student is moderately high, but not extremely high, hence the score of 0.6.
