Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles suggest he could be a decent match for computer science. However, the sketch does not mention a specific passion for technology, math, or programming, and instead highlights Adam's curiosity about nature and love of animals. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science graduate student as 0.6 out of 1.
