Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are quite typical of computer science graduate students. However, the strong empathy, love of nature and animals, and quiet demeanor are less typical, though certainly not unheard of. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science grad student as 0.6 out of 1.
