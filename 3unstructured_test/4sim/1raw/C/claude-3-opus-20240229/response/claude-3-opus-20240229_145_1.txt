Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could be a reasonable fit for computer science. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and strong empathy, which are less directly relevant to computer science. Therefore, I estimate he is moderately similar to a typical computer science graduate student, but not an ideal match based solely on the given description.
