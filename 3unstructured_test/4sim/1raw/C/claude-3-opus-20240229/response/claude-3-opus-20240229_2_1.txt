Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are traits that would fit well with a computer science graduate student. However, the personality sketch does not directly mention an interest or aptitude in technology, math, or programming, which are more typical traits for this field. Adam's strong empathy and love of nature and animals are less commonly associated with computer science. So I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science grad student as a 0.6 out of 1.
