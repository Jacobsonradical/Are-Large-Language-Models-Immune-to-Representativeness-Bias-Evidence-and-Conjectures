Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align fairly well with traits often found in computer science graduate students, his strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less typical of computer science students compared to some other fields. So I estimate he is moderately similar to a typical computer science grad student, but not an ideal match, hence the similarity score of 0.6.
