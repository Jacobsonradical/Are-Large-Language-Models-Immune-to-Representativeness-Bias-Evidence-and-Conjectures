Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While some aspects of Adam's personality align with computer science such as his high intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, other aspects seem less typical such as his curiosity about nature and plants, and his strong empathy and love of animals. Many computer science students tend to be more interested in technology than nature. So while there is some overlap, he doesn't seem to be a quintessential match for the field based on the description provided. Of course, there is a lot of individual variation among grad students in any discipline.
