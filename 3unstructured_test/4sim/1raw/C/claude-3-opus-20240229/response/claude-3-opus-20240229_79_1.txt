Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could align well with computer science. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more his interest in nature, animals, and puzzles rather than technology or programming. So while there is some potential overlap, he doesn't seem like the most typical computer science graduate student based on the information provided.
