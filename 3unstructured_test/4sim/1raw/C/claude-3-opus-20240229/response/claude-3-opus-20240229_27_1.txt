Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has some traits that could align with computer science, such as being good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoying solving puzzles. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's love of nature, animals, and his strong empathy, which are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science graduate student as 0.6 out of 1.
