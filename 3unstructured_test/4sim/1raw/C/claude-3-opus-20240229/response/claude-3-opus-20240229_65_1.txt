Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, on a scale from 0 to 1:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam exhibits high intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts, which would be valuable in computer science, his strong interests in nature, animals, and puzzles are less directly aligned with the typical profile of a computer science grad student. However, problem-solving skills and dedication are certainly relevant. So I estimate a similarity of 0.6, indicating some overlap in relevant traits but not an extremely close match to the archetypal computer science student.
