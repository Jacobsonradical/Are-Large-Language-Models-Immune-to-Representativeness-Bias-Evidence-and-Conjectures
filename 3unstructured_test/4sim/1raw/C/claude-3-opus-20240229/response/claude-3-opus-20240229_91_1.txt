Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are quite applicable to computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, animals, and empathy are less typical for computer science students, who tend to be more focused on technology. So I would assess Adam as being moderately similar to a typical computer science grad student, but not a perfect match.
