Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's quiet nature, intelligence, strong grasp of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could match well with computer science. However, the sketch emphasizes his love of nature, animals, and puzzles more than typical technical interests, so I wouldn't consider him an extremely close match to the average computer science graduate student. A similarity score of 0.6 seems appropriate given the information provided.
