Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, the sketch does not specifically mention an interest or aptitude for programming, math, or technology, which are key traits for this field. His strong empathy and love of nature and animals are less directly relevant. So I would estimate a moderate similarity of 0.6 between Adam and a typical computer science grad student based on the information provided.
