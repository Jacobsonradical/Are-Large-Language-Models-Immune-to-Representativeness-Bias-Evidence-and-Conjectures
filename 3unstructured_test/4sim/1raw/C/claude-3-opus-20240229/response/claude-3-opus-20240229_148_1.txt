Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could align well with a computer science student. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and puzzles is less typical of computer science in particular. So I estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science grad student as moderately above average, but not extremely high.
