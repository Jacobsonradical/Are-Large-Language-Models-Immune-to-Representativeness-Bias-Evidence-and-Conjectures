Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and interest in solving puzzles align fairly well with qualities that would suit graduate studies in computer science, his other traits like curiosity about nature/plants, empathy, and love of animals are less directly relevant to this field. So I'd estimate he has a moderate similarity of 0.6 to the typical computer science grad student profile.
