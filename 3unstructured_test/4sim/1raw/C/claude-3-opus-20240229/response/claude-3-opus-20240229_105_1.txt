Here is my assessment of the similarity between Adam and a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The traits of high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles are quite common among computer science graduate students. However, the strong interest in nature/plants and animals is less typical for this field. And the description does not mention some other traits that are common among computer science students, like a strong interest in technology and mathematics. So I estimate the overall similarity is around 0.6 out of 1.
