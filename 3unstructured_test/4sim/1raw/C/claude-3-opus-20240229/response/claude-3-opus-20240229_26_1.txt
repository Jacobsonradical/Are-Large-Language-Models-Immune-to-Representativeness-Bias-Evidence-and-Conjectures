Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While Adam has some traits that could align with computer science such as high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles, other aspects of his personality like his curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love of animals are less typical of computer science graduate students. So I estimate he has a moderate similarity of 0.6 to the typical graduate student in that field.
