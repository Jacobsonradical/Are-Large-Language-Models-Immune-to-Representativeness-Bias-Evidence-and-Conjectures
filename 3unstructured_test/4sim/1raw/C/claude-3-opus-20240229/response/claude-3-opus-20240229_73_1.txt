Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's quiet nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could align well with studying computer science. However, the personality sketch emphasizes his curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love of animals, which are less directly relevant to computer science. So while there is some overlap, I would assess his similarity to a typical computer science grad student as moderately above average, but not extremely high.
