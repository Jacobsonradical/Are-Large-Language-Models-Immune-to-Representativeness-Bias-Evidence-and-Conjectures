Here is my analysis of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has high intelligence, is good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits align reasonably well with skills that are valuable for computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his empathy and love of animals, and his appreciation for hard work. While these are all positive qualities, they are not as directly relevant to computer science. Overall, I would estimate Adam's similarity to a typical computer science graduate student as a 0.6 out of 1 based on the information provided.
