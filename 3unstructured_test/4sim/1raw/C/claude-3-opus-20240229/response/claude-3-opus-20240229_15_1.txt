Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While some aspects of Adam's personality align with traits that could be beneficial in computer science, such as his intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, the sketch does not provide strong evidence that he would be highly similar to the typical computer science graduate student. His deep love of nature, animals, and warm empathetic personality are less directly relevant to the field. More information about his specific technical skills and academic background would be needed to draw a stronger similarity. Therefore, I estimate a moderate similarity of 0.6 based on the limited information provided.
