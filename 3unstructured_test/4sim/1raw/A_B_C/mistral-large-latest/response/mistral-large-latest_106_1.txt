Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy, love for nature, and interest in abstract concepts do not strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student, hence the lower score of 0.4.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, he seems quite similar to a typical graduate student in this field, hence the higher score of 0.8.
- Computer Science: Adam's intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student, but his strong orientation towards nature and animals makes him not a perfect fit, hence a score of 0.6.
