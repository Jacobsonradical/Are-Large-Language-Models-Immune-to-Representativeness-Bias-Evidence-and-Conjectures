Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work may be relevant, but his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in puzzles and abstract concepts do not strongly correlate with the typical business administration graduate student.
- Computer Science: Adam's high intelligence, interest in puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts are quite relevant to computer science, hence a higher similarity score.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong empathy, he seems most similar to a typical graduate student in this field.
