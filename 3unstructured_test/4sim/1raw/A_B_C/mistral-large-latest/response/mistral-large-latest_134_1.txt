Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business, but his strong curiosity for nature and animals, as well as his preference for quiet, puzzle-solving activities, don't typically align with the more extroverted and corporate environment of business administration.
- Computer Science: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are strongly aligned with the skills needed for computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature is less typically associated with this field.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align very well with the fields of agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with these fields.
