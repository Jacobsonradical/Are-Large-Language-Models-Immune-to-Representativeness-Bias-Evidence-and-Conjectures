Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy, love for nature, and curiosity about plants do not typically align with the skills and interests of a business administration student, hence the lower score.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, he seems highly similar to a typical graduate student in this field.
- Computer Science: While Adam's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could be relevant to computer science, his strong orientation towards nature and animals might not be as typical in this field, hence a moderate score.
