Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are traits that align with those of a typical computer science graduate student. However, his deep love for animals and nature is not as commonly emphasized in this field, hence the score of 0.6.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, its various plants, and his deep love for animals, he shares many traits with a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His strong empathy and appreciation for hard work also align well with this field, hence the score of 0.8.
- Business Administration (0.3): While Adam's high intelligence may be relevant, his personality sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with business administration graduate students, such as leadership, entrepreneurial spirit, or a strong focus on management and organizational skills. Hence, the score of 0.3.
