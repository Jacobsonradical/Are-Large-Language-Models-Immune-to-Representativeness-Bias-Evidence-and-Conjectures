Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are traits that align with a typical graduate student in computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature is less typical for this field, hence a score of 0.6.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make him very similar to a typical graduate student in this field. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well, hence a score of 0.8.
- Business Administration (0.3): While Adam's high intelligence may be relevant, his personality traits such as being quiet, his deep love for animals and nature, and his preference for solving puzzles rather than management or leadership tasks make him less similar to a typical graduate student in business administration, hence a score of 0.3.
