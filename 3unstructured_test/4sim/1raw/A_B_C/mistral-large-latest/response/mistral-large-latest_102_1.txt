Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are traits that align with those of a typical computer science graduate student. However, his deep love for animals and nature is not as commonly emphasized in this field, hence the score of 0.6.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make him very similar to a typical graduate student in this field. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with the demands of these fields.
- Business Administration (0.3): While Adam's high intelligence may be relevant, his personality sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with business administration graduate students, such as leadership, entrepreneurial spirit, or interest in management and corporate strategies. Hence, the score of 0.3.
