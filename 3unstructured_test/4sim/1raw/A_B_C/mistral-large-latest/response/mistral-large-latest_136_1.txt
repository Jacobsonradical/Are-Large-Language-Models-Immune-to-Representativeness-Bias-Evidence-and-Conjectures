Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy, love for nature, and curiosity don't typically align with the skills and interests of a business administration student, hence the lower score.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and curiosity about nature and plants, he seems quite similar to a typical graduate student in this field.
- Computer Science: While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could be a good fit, his strong connection to nature and animals isn't as typically associated with computer science, hence the moderate score.
