Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work may align with certain aspects of business administration, but his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals suggests that he might not be as similar to a typical business administration graduate student.
- Computer Science: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student. However, his strong interest in nature and animals might differentiate him from the stereotypical computer science student.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, he appears to be most similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
