Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy, curiosity about nature, and love for animals do not typically align with the skill set and interests of a business administration graduate student. Hence, the lower similarity score of 0.4.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, he seems quite similar to a typical graduate student in this field. Hence, the high similarity score of 0.8.
- Computer Science: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student. However, his strong connection to nature and animals is less typical in this field, hence a mid-range similarity score of 0.6.
