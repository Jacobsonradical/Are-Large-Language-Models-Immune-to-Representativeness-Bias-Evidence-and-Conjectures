Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a strong fit with agricultural and veterinary science (0.8).
- His intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate a good fit with computer science (0.6), but his personality sketch doesn't emphasize technological interests.
- Business administration (0.3) seems the least similar due to the lack of mention of leadership, management, or business-related interests in Adam's personality sketch.
