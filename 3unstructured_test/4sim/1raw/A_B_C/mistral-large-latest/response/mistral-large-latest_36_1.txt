Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are traits that align with a typical graduate student in computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature is less typical for this field, hence the score of 0.6.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make him very similar to a typical graduate student in this field. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well, hence the score of 0.8.
- Business Administration (0.3): Adam's traits such as being quiet, having a warm heart, and a deep love for animals and nature do not typically align with graduate students in business administration. While his high intelligence and understanding of hard work are relevant, the other traits make him less similar to a typical business administration graduate student, hence the score of 0.3.
