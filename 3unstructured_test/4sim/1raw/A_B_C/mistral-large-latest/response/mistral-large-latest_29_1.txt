Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business, but his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in puzzles and abstract concepts don't strongly correlate with the typical business administration student.
- Computer Science: Adam's intelligence, interest in puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts are well-suited to computer science. However, his strong love for animals and nature is less typical in this field.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make him very similar to a typical graduate student in this field. His appreciation for hard work and dedication is also valuable in this area of study.
