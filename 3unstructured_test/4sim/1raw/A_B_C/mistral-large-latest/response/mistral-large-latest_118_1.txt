Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy, love for nature, and curiosity about plants do not typically align with the skill set and interests of a business administration graduate student, hence the lower score.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, he seems quite similar to a typical graduate student in this field.
- Computer Science: While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could be a good fit, his strong affinity for nature and animals is less typically associated with computer science graduate students, hence a mid-range score.
