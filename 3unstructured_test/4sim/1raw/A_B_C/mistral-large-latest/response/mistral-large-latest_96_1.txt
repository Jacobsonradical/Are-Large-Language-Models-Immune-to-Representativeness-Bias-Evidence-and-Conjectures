Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with the skills needed for computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are not typically emphasized in this field.
- Business Administration (0.3): Adam's profile does not strongly align with typical business administration graduate students. His quiet nature, strong empathy, and love for animals are not typically emphasized in this field.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make him very similar to a typical graduate student in this field. His understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication also align well.
