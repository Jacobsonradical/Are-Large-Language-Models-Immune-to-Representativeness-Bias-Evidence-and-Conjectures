Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy, love for nature, and curiosity don't typically align with the skills and interests of a business administration student, hence the lower score.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, he seems quite similar to a typical graduate student in this field.
- Computer Science: While Adam's intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills might be relevant, his strong orientation towards nature and animals makes him somewhat less typical of a computer science student, hence the moderate score.
