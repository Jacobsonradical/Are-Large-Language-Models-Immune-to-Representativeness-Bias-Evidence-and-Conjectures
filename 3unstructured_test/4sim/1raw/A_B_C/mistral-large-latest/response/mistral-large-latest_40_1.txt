Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business, but his strong curiosity about nature and animals, as well as his preference for quiet puzzle-solving, don't align as closely with the typical business administration student.
- Computer Science: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are traits that align well with computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature is less typical in this field.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align very well with this field. His appreciation for hard work and dedication is also valuable in this demanding field.
