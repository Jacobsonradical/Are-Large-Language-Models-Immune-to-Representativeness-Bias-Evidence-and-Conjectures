Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work may not directly correlate with the typical traits of a business administration graduate student, hence the lower score.
- Computer Science: His high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills align with the typical traits of a computer science graduate student, but his strong love for nature and animals is less typical, hence the mid-range score.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align very well with the typical traits of a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high score.
