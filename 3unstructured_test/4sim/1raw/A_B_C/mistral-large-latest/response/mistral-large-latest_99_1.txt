Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality sketch does not highlight strong business acumen or interest in management and leadership, hence the lower score.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, he seems highly similar to a typical graduate student in this field.
- Computer Science: Adam's intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest a good fit with computer science, though his interests in nature and animals are not as directly related to this field.
