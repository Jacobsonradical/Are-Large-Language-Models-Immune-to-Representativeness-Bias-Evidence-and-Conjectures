Explanation:
- "computer science": 0.6 - Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with traits of a typical computer science graduate student. However, his deep love for animals and nature is not as commonly emphasized in this field, hence a score of 0.6.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8 - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make him very similar to a typical graduate student in this field.
- "business administration": 0.3 - While Adam's high intelligence may be relevant, his personality traits such as quietness, strong empathy, and deep love for nature and animals do not strongly align with the typical traits emphasized in business administration, hence a score of 0.3.
