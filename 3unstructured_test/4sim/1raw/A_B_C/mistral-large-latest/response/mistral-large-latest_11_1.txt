However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are not as typical for this field, hence a score of 0.6.
- "business administration": 0.3 - Adam's profile does not closely match that of a typical business administration graduate student. His quiet nature, strong empathy, and love for animals and nature are not as commonly found in this field, hence a score of 0.3.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8 - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication closely match the typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, hence a score of 0.8.
