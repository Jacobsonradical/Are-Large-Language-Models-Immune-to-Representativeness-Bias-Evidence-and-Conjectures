Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy, love for nature, and interest in abstract concepts do not strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student, hence the lower similarity score.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, he seems quite similar to a typical graduate student in this field.
- Computer Science: Adam's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles make him somewhat similar to a typical computer science graduate student, but his strong affinity for nature and animals is less typical in this field.
