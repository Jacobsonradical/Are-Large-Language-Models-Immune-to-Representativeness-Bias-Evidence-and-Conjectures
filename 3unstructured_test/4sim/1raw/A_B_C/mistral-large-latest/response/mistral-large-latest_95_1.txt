Explanation:
- "computer science": Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with the skills needed for computer science. However, his strong love for animals and nature makes him not a perfect fit, hence 0.6.
- "business administration": Adam's qualities do not seem to align strongly with this field. He is quiet and empathetic, which are not typically the core traits of business administration students, hence 0.3.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, he seems to be a good fit for this field, hence 0.8.
