Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he might have some similarities with a typical computer science graduate student. However, his strong interest in nature and animals is not typically associated with this field, hence a middling score.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, its various plants, and his deep love for animals, he shares many traits with a typical graduate student in this field.
- Business Administration (0.3): While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, his personality sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with business administration graduate students, such as leadership, management skills, or interest in business topics.
