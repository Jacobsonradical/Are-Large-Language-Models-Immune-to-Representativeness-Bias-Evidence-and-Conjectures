Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business, but his strong curiosity about nature and animals, as well as his preference for quiet, analytical tasks like solving puzzles, don't align as closely with the typical business administration student.
- Computer Science: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills needed for computer science. However, his strong love for animals and nature is less typical in this field.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align very well with the typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication is also valuable in these fields.
