Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not typically align with the skills and interests of a business administration student, hence the lower score.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, he seems quite similar to a typical graduate student in this field.
- Computer Science: While Adam's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with this field, his strong affinity for nature and animals is less typical among computer science students, hence a mid-range score.
