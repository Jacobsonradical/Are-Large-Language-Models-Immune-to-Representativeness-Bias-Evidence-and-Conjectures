Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work may be relevant, but his strong curiosity for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts, do not typically align with the core skills and interests of business administration students.
- Computer Science: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are traits that align well with the skills needed for computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals is less typical of computer science students.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy align very well with the interests and skills of students in agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication is also relevant to these fields.
