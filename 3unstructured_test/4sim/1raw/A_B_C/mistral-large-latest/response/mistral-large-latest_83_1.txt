Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with students in agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high similarity score of 0.8.
- His enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts suggest some similarity to computer science students, but the personality sketch does not emphasize technological or programming interests, hence a moderate score of 0.6.
- There is little in the personality sketch to suggest a strong fit with business administration, as it does not mention leadership, management, or business-related skills, hence the low similarity score of 0.3.
