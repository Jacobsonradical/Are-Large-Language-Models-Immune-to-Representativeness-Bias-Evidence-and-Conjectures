Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with the skills needed for computer science. However, his personality sketch doesn't highlight a strong interest in technology or programming, which is why the score is not higher.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, he seems quite similar to a typical graduate student in this field.
- Business Administration (0.3): While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's no mention of leadership skills, interest in management, or business acumen, which are typically associated with business administration students.
