Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business, but his strong interest in nature, animals, and puzzles (abstract concepts) does not closely align with the typical business administration student.
- Computer Science: Adam's high intelligence, curiosity, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align well with the field of computer science. However, his strong love for nature and animals is less typical among computer science students.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make him very similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
