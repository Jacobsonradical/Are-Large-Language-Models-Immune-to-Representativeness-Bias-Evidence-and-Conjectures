Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills are relevant to computer science. However, his strong interest in nature and animals is less typical of computer science students.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make him very similar to a typical graduate student in this field.
- Business Administration (0.3): Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant, but his quiet nature, focus on nature and animals, and interest in puzzles and abstract concepts are less typical of business administration students.
