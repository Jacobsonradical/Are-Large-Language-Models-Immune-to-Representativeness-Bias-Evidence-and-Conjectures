Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy, love for nature, and interest in abstract concepts do not typically align with the skill set and interests of a business administration student, hence the lower score.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, he seems quite similar to a typical graduate student in this field.
- Computer Science: While Adam's intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills align with this field, his strong orientation towards nature and animals slightly reduces the similarity.
