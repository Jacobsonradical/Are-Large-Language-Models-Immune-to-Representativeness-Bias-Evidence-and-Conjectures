Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with students in agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high similarity score of 0.8.
- His intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts are common traits among computer science students, but his personality sketch doesn't emphasize technological interests, hence a moderate similarity score of 0.6.
- Business administration students often have strong leadership, management, and entrepreneurial skills, which are not explicitly mentioned in Adam's personality sketch. His appreciation for hard work and dedication is common among all graduate students, but it's not enough to indicate a high similarity to business administration students, hence the low similarity score of 0.3.
