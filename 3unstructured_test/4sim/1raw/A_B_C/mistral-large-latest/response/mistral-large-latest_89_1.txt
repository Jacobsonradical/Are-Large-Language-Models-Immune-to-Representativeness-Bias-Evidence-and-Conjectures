Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work may align with certain aspects of business administration, but his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts do not strongly correlate with this field, hence a score of 0.4.
- Computer Science: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student, but his strong affinity for nature and animals is less common in this field, hence a score of 0.6.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and strong empathy make him very similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, hence a score of 0.8.
