Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work might be relevant, but his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts don't strongly align with the typical business administration graduate student.
- Computer Science: Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong empathy, he seems quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
