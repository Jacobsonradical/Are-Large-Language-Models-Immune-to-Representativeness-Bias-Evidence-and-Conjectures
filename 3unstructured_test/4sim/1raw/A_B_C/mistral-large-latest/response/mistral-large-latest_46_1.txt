Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business, but his strong curiosity about nature and animals, as well as his preference for quiet puzzle-solving, don't typically align with the more extroverted and competitive nature of business administration.
- Computer Science: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the problem-solving and analytical skills required in computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature is less typically associated with this field.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align very well with these fields. His appreciation for hard work and dedication is also valuable in these fields, which often involve physical labor and long hours.
