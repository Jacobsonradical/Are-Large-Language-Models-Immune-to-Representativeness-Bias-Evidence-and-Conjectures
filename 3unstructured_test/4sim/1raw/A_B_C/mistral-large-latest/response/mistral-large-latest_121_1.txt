- "business administration": Adam's profile does not highlight characteristics typically associated with business administration graduate students, such as leadership, management skills, or entrepreneurial spirit. Therefore, a score of 0.3.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align very well with the typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, hence a score of 0.8.
