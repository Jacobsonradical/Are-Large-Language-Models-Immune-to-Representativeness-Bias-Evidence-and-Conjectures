Explanation:
- Business Administration: Adam's personality traits such as empathy, love for nature and animals, and his quiet demeanor do not typically align with the skill set and personality traits common in business administration, hence the lower score.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, he seems quite similar to a typical graduate student in this field.
- Computer Science: While Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts align with this field, his strong orientation towards nature and animals slightly reduces the similarity, hence a moderate score.
