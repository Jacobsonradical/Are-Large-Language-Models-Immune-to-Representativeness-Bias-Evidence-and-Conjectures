Based on Adam's personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation for the ratings:
1. **Computer Science**: Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, both of which are traits that are beneficial in computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals suggests his primary interests might align more closely with other fields.
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly indicate a natural alignment with agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **Business Administration**: There is less indication from the personality sketch that Adam's traits align with business administration, making him less similar to a typical graduate student in this field. His interests and values seem much more strongly aligned with nature and empathy rather than business.
