Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here is the similarity assessment:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
```

- **Business administration (0.2)**: Adam's traits such as a strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are not typically aligned with the priorities and characteristics commonly found in business administration students, making him less similar.

- **Computer science (0.5)**: Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest some alignment with traits typical in computer science students. However, his strong focus on nature and animals indicates a partial rather than a strong fit.

- **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.9)**: Given Adam's deep love for animals, warm heart, empathy, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants, he is very similar to a typical student in agricultural and veterinary science.
