Based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here's the similarity rating in the mentioned fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.3)**: Adam's focus on nature, plants, animals, and empathy suggests he is less likely to fit the typical profile of a graduate student in business administration, which is more oriented towards management, finance, and organizational behavior.
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, all of which align well with computer science. However, the sketch emphasizes his love for nature and animals, making this a secondary fit.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.9)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and deep love for animals, he aligns closely with the interests and values typical of students in agricultural and veterinary science.
