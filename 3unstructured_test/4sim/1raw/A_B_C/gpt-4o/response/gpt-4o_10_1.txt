Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and deep love for animals suggest a high similarity to students in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts show some overlap with computer science, though not as much as with agricultural and veterinary science. His characteristics seem to have the least in common with business administration, which typically focuses more on management and organizational skills rather than on natural phenomena or empathy.
