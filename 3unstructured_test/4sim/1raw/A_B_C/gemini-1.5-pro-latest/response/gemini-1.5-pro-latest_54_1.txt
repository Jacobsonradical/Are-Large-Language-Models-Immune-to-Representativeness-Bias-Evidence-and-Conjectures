**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's love for puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His quiet nature is also somewhat common in the field. However, his interest in nature isn't directly related.
* **Business Administration:** Adam's personality profile doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business. While his intelligence is a benefit, his empathy and lack of clear ambition for business make him less typical.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly resonate with these fields. His curiosity and intelligence would also serve him well.
