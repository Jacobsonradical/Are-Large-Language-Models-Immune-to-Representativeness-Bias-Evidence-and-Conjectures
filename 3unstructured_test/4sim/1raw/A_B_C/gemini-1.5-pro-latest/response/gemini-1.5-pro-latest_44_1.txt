**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Adam's puzzle-solving skills and high intelligence align well with computer science. However, his love for nature and animals is less typical of the field. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence is valuable in business, Adam's empathy and love for animals don't strongly suggest a business inclination.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest an affinity with this field.
