**Explanation:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication make him quite similar to a typical graduate student in this field. 
* **Business administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are useful in business, Adam's personality description doesn't strongly align with the typical traits associated with business administration students (e.g., leadership, ambition, strong networking skills). 
* **Computer science:** Adam's love for puzzles and ability to grasp abstract concepts suggest he might enjoy computer science. His quiet nature also aligns with some stereotypes of the field. However,  without more information about his specific interests and skills, it's hard to say for sure.
