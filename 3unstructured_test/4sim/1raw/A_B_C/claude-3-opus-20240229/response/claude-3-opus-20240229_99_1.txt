Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants and love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet demeanor, puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts also fits reasonably well with a computer science student, though not quite as strongly. The personality description doesn't provide as much evidence that he would be similar to a typical business administration graduate student.
