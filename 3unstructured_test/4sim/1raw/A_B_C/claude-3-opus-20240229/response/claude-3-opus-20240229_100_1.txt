Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. 

His quiet nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts indicates some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student.

The personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be similar to a typical business administration student. While his strong understanding and appreciation of hard work and dedication are relevant traits, overall the description paints a picture of someone more aligned with scientific fields than business.
