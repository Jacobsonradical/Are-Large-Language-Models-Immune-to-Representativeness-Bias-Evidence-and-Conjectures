Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. 

His quiet nature and enjoyment of solving puzzles, along with his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, indicate some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student.

The personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be similar to a typical business administration graduate student, as it does not highlight entrepreneurial drive, leadership skills, or interest in management and finance.
