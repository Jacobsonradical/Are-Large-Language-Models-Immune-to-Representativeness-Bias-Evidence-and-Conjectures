Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. 

His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would make him somewhat similar to a typical computer science grad student, though the personality sketch doesn't specifically mention an interest in technology.

The description doesn't mention much overlap with typical traits of business administration students, so I rated that the lowest in terms of similarity. Problem-solving skills could translate to the business world to some degree.

Of course, this is a very rough assessment based on limited information. Graduate students in any field exhibit a wide range of personality traits, skills and interests. But I tried to match the description to what I perceive to be some common attributes of students in each field.
