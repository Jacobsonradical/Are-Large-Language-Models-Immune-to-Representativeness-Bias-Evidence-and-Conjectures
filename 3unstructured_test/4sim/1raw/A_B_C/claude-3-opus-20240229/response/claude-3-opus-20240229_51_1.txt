Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest he may be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to computer science as well, though perhaps to a lesser degree. The personality sketch provides less evidence that he would be a strong match for a typical graduate student in business administration.
