Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.

His abstract thinking skills and intelligence indicate some similarity to computer science graduate students, but the personality sketch doesn't mention a specific interest or aptitude in that field.

The description doesn't include traits that are strongly associated with typical business administration students, so I rated the similarity lower for that field. Problem-solving skills could be relevant, but overall there seems to be limited overlap based on the given information.
