Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be very similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.

His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree, though the personality sketch doesn't specifically mention technical or mathematical aptitude. 

The description doesn't include much to suggest strong similarity to a typical business administration student, such as leadership drive, competitiveness, or interest in management, economics or finance.

Of course, this is a subjective assessment based on generalizations. Any individual may deviate from the typical profile of students in their field.
