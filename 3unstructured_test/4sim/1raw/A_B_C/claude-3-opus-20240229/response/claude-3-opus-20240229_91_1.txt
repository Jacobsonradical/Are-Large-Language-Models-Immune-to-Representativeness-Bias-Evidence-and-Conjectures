Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest he may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit reasonably well with computer science. The personality sketch provides less evidence of similarity to a typical business administration graduate student.
