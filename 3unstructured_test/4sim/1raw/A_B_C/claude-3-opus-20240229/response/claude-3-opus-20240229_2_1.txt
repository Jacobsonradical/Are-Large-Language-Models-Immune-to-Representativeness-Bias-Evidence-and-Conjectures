Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Based on his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and warm empathetic personality, Adam seems very similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.

His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggests some similarity to computer science students as well, but the fit doesn't seem quite as strong as for agricultural/veterinary science.

Business administration seems least similar, as the personality sketch doesn't mention much related to business, management, finance, etc. His appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to business somewhat, but overall the similarity seems lowest of the three fields.
