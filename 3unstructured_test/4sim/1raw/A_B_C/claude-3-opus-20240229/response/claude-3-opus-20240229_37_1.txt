Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and his strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would make him somewhat similar to a typical computer science student. However, the description doesn't show strong similarities to a typical business administration student, as it doesn't mention traits like leadership, competitiveness, or extroversion that are more common in that field.
