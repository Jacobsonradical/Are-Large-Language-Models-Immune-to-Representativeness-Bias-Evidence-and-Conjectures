Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for nature, plants and animals, as well as his strong empathy, suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles indicate some similarity to computer science students, though perhaps not as strong. The personality sketch provides less evidence of similarity to business administration students, though his appreciation for hard work and dedication may be relevant qualities.
