Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest he would be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to computer science as well. Business administration seems least similar to his personality and interests based on the description provided.
