Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants and love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would make him somewhat similar to a computer science grad student, though the personality sketch doesn't specifically mention an interest in technology. The description doesn't include much to suggest similarity to a typical business administration student, so I rated that the lowest, though his appreciation for hard work and dedication would be relevant qualities.
