Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. His intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts also point to some similarity with computer science students. The personality description indicates less overlap with the typical profile of an MBA student.
