Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be most similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also align somewhat with computer science. The personality sketch provides the least evidence that Adam would be similar to a typical graduate student in business administration.
