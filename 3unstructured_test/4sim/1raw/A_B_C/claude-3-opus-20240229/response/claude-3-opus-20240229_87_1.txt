Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and dedication suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. His intelligence, problem-solving skills and ability to understand abstract concepts would make him somewhat similar to a typical computer science grad student. The personality sketch provides less evidence of traits typical of a business administration student, so I rated that similarity lower.
