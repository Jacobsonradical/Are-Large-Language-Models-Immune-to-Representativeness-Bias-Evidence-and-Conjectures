Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Based on Adam's love for nature, animals, and his strong empathy, he seems to have a high similarity to typical graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts suggests some similarity to computer science students as well. However, the personality sketch doesn't provide strong indications that Adam would be especially similar to typical graduate students in business administration compared to the other two fields.
