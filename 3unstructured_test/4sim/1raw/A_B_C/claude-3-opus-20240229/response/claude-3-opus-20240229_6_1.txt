Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also gives him some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student. However, the personality sketch does not emphasize traits that would be most associated with a typical business administration student, such as leadership, competitiveness, or extroversion.
