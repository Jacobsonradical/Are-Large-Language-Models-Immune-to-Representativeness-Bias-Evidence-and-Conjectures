Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.

His quiet demeanor, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and strong intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts give him some similarities to a typical computer science graduate student, but not as much as agricultural and veterinary science.

While he has high intelligence which would serve him well in business administration, his overall profile doesn't seem to align as closely with the typical graduate student in that field compared to the other two. His empathy and love of animals and nature don't seem as relevant for business.
