Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The rationale:
Adam's curiosity about nature, love of animals, and empathy suggest he may be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. 
His intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate some similarity to computer science students, but perhaps not as strong a fit.
The description does not highlight traits that are as directly relevant to business administration, such as leadership, competitiveness, or extroversion, so I assess a lower similarity there based on the information provided.
