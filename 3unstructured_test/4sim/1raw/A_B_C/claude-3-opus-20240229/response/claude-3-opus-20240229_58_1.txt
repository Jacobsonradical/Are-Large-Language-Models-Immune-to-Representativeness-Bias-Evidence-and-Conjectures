{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"

Computer science: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he may have some similarity to computer science students, but the sketch doesn't mention a specific interest in computers or technology. Score: 0.6

Business administration: The personality sketch doesn't highlight any strong business or leadership traits that would be typical of graduate students in business administration. Score: 0.3

Agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals, along with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, seem to align very closely with the interests and traits of a typical agricultural or veterinary science graduate student. Score: 0.9
