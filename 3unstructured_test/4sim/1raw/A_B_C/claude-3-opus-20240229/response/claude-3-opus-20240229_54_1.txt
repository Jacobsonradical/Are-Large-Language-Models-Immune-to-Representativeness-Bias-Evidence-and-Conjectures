Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be somewhat similar to a computer science student. However, his strong empathy and love of animals are less typical for that field.

His personality seems rather dissimilar from a typical business administration student. While he appreciates hard work, other key traits for business, like assertiveness and networking, are not mentioned.

Agricultural and veterinary science seems the closest match. His curiosity about plants, love of animals, and appreciation for dedication align well with typical traits for graduate students in that domain.
