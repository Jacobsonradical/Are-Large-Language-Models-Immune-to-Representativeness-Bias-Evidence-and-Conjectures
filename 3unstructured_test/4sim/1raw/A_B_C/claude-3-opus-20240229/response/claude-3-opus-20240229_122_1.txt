Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The rationale:

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a strong similarity to students in agricultural and veterinary science programs.

His quiet nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts points to some overlap with typical computer science students. 

The personality sketch provides less indication that Adam would be similar to the average MBA student. His strong empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication are good general traits, but overall his profile seems less aligned to common business student characteristics and interests.
