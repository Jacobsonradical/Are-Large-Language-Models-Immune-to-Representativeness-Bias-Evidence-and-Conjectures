Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, animals, and his strong empathy suggest he would be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and enjoyment of puzzles indicate some similarity to computer science students as well. The personality sketch provides less evidence of traits typical of business administration students.
