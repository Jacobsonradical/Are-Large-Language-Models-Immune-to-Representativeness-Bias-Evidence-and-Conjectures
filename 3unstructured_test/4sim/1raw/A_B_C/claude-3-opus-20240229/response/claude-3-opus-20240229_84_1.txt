Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student. The personality sketch provides less evidence of similarity to a typical business administration graduate student.
