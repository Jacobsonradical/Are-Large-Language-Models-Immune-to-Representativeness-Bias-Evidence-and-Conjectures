Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem most aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit reasonably well with computer science, though perhaps not quite as strongly. The personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be similar to a typical graduate student in business administration.
