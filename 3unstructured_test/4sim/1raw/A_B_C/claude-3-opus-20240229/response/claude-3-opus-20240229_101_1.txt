Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about plants and nature, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.

His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles indicate some similarity to a computer science graduate student, but perhaps not as strong a fit as agricultural and veterinary science.

While he has an appreciation for hard work and dedication which is important in business, overall his personality seems less similar to a typical graduate student in business administration compared to the other two fields.
