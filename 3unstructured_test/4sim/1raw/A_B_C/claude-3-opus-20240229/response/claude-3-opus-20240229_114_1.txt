Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. 

His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would make him somewhat similar to a computer science grad student, though the personality sketch doesn't specifically mention technical skills or interests.

The description doesn't include much to suggest strong similarity to a typical business administration student, as it doesn't highlight leadership, competitiveness, or enterprising qualities. His quiet demeanor and focus on puzzles and concepts over people also point to lower similarity there.

Of course, this is a subjective estimate based on generalizations. Any individual can diverge from typical profiles for their field. But based solely on what's provided, those are my rough numeric estimates for Adam's resemblance to archetypal grad students in each discipline.
