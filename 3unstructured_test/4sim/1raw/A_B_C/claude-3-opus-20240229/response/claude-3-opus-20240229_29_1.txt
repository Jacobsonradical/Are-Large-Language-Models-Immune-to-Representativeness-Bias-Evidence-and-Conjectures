Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student.

His quietness, abstract thinking, and puzzle solving point to some similarity with computer science grad students, though to a lesser degree than agricultural/veterinary science.

The personality sketch provides little indication that Adam would be very similar to a typical business administration grad student.
