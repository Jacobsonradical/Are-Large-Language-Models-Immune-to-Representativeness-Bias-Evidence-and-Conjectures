Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest he may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, problem-solving skills and ability to understand abstract concepts would make him somewhat similar to a computer science grad student. However, the personality sketch doesn't provide strong indications that he would be very similar to a typical MBA student, as key business-related traits and interests aren't highlighted.
