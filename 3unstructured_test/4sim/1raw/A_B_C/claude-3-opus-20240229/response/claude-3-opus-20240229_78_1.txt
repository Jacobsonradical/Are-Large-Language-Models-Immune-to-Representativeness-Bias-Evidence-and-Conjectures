Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. 

His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate some similarity to a computer science graduate student, but the personality sketch doesn't mention a specific interest or aptitude for technology and programming.

The description doesn't include much to suggest strong similarity to a typical business administration student, as it doesn't highlight interests in management, finance, leadership, etc.

Of course, this is just my subjective interpretation based on the limited information provided about Adam. Graduate students in any field can have a diverse range of personalities, interests and strengths.
