Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. 

His intelligence, skill at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles indicate some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student as well.

However, the personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be very similar to a typical business administration graduate student.
