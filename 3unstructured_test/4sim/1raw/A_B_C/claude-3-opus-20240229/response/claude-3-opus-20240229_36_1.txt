Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.

His quiet demeanor and enjoyment of solving puzzles hint at some similarity to computer science graduate students, but it's not as strong of a match as agricultural and veterinary science.

While his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to business administration, overall his personality seems less similar to the typical graduate student in that field compared to the other two.
