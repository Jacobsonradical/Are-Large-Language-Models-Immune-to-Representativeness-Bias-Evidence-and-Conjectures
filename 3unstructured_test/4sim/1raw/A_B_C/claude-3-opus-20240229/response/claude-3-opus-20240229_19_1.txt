Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles indicate some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student, though perhaps not as strong a fit as agricultural and veterinary science.

The personality sketch provides less evidence of similarity to a typical graduate student in business administration. While Adam's strong understanding and appreciation of hard work and dedication are relevant traits, overall the sketch suggests his interests and strengths lie more in other areas.
