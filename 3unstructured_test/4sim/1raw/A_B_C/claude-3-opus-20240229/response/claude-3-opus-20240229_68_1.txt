Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, and his strong empathy suggest he would be a good fit for graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles indicate he may also do well in computer science. The personality sketch provides less evidence that he would be strongly suited for graduate studies in business administration compared to the other two fields.
