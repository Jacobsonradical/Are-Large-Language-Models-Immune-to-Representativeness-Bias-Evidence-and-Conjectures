Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. 

His curiosity, intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts would make him somewhat similar to a typical computer science grad student, though perhaps not as strongly.

The personality sketch doesn't highlight many traits typically associated with business administration, like leadership, competitiveness, or extroversion, so I rated the similarity lower for that field. Problem-solving skills could translate, but overall he seems less similar to a typical MBA student.
