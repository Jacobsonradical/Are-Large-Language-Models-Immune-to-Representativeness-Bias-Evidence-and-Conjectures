Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet demeanor, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student. The personality sketch provides fewer clues that Adam would be similar to a typical business administration graduate student.
