Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. 

His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles indicate he would also have significant similarity to a computer science graduate student, though perhaps not quite as much as for agricultural/veterinary science.

The personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be similar to a typical business administration graduate student. While he is intelligent and appreciates hard work, the sketch does not highlight interests or traits that are particularly characteristic of business students.
