Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with his deep love for animals, suggests he would be most similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.

His quiet demeanor, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts indicates some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student. 

The description of Adam doesn't include much to suggest strong similarity to a typical graduate student in business administration, other than a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication which could apply to many fields.
