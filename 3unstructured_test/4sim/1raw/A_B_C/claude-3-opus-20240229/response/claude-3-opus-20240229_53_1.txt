Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest he may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate some similarity to computer science graduate students. The personality sketch provides less evidence of similarity to typical business administration graduate students.
