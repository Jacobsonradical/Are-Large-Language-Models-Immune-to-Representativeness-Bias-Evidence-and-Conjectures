Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts indicate some similarity to computer science graduate students. However, the personality sketch provides less evidence that he would be similar to a typical business administration graduate student.
