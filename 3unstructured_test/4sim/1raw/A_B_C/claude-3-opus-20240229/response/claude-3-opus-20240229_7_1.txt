Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and skill at understanding abstract concepts suggest he could do well in computer science. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy, seem to align him more with agricultural and veterinary science. While he has an appreciation for hard work which is important in business, overall his personality seems less suited to typical business administration students.
