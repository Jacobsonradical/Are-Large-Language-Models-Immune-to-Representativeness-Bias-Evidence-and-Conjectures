Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals along with his empathy and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science grad student. His intelligence, abstract thinking and puzzle-solving point to some similarity with computer science students. The description seems less characteristic of a typical business administration student.
