Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.

His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles indicate some similarity to a computer science graduate student, though perhaps not an extremely close match.

The personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be very similar to a typical graduate student in business administration, as key traits like leadership drive, competitiveness, and interpersonal skills are not strongly emphasized. His quiet nature and focus on puzzles and abstract concepts seem less aligned with this field.
