Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love of animals, and empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts and problem solving hint at potential similarity to computer science students as well, though perhaps not quite as strongly. The personality sketch provides less evidence of traits commonly associated with business administration, so I rated the similarity lower for that field.
