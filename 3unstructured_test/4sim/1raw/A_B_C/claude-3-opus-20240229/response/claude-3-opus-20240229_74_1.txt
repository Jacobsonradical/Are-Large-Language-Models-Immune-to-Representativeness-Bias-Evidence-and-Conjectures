Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. 

His quiet nature and enjoyment of solving puzzles indicate some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student, but it's not a very strong match based on the limited information provided.

There's not much in the personality sketch to suggest strong similarity to a typical business administration graduate student. Problem-solving skills and intelligence could be relevant, but overall the description doesn't align closely with common traits in that field.
