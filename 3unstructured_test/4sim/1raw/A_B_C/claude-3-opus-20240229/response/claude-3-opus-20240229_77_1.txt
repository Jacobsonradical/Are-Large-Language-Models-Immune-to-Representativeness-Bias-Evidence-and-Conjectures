Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles indicates some similarity to computer science students as well. The personality sketch provides less evidence of similarity to typical business administration students, though his appreciation for hard work and dedication would be relevant traits in that field too.
