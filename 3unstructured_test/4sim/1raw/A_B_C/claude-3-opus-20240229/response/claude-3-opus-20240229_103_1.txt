Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggests he could fit reasonably well as a computer science student. His love of nature, animals, and empathy indicate a strong fit with agricultural and veterinary science. The personality sketch provides less evidence that he would be similar to a typical graduate business administration student.
