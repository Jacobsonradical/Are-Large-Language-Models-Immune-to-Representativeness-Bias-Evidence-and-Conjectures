Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. 

His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would make him somewhat similar to a typical computer science grad student, though the sketch doesn't mention technical skills or interest in technology.

The description of Adam as quiet and empathetic with a genuine curiosity doesn't align as closely with the stereotypical business administration student profile, so I rated that similarity lower. Of course, these are generalizations and any individual can be suited for a variety of fields regardless of personality.
