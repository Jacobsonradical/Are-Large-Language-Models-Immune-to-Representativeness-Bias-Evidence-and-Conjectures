Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.

His aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, along with high intelligence, imply some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student. 

The personality sketch provides less evidence of similarity to a typical graduate student in business administration, as it does not highlight traits like leadership, competitiveness, or extroversion that are more common in that field. However, his appreciation for hard work and dedication would apply in any field to some degree.
