Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants and love for animals suggests he may be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science grad student. His strong empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also traits that would fit well in that field.

His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggests some similarity to a typical computer science grad student. However, the sketch doesn't specifically mention technical or mathematical aptitude.

The details provided don't strongly indicate similarity to a typical business administration grad student. While intelligence and hard work are certainly relevant, key traits for that field like leadership, competitiveness, extroversion or risk-taking are not mentioned.

Of course, this is a very rough assessment based on limited information. Individuals can certainly deviate from the typical profile of their field. But based solely on what's provided, I judged agricultural and veterinary science as the closest fit, followed by computer science and then business administration as the least similar. Let me know if you have any other questions!
