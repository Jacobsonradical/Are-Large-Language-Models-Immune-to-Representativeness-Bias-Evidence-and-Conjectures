Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he may be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles also align somewhat with computer science. The personality sketch provides less evidence that he would be similar to a typical graduate student in business administration.
