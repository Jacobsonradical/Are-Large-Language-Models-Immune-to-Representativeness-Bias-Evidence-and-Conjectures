Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest he may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him somewhat similar to a computer science grad student, though the personality sketch doesn't specifically mention an interest in that field. The description seems least similar to a typical business administration graduate student profile.
