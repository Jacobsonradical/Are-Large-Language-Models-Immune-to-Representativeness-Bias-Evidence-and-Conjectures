Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants and animals, as well as his empathy and love for animals, suggests he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.

His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles indicates some similarity to computer science graduate students, though perhaps not an ideal match.

The personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be similar to a typical graduate student in business administration. His appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant, but overall the description paints a picture of someone more oriented towards science and nature rather than business.
