Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also make him somewhat similar to a typical computer science graduate student. However, the personality sketch does not highlight traits that are stereotypically associated with business administration, such as competitiveness, assertiveness, or extroversion, so he seems less similar to a typical graduate student in that field.
