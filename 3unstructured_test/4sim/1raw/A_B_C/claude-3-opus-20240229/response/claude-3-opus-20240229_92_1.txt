Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Explanation:
Business administration: Adam's curiosity, intelligence and appreciation for hard work could be applicable in business, but his quiet nature and love of animals suggest his interests may lie elsewhere. Hence a relatively low score of 0.3.

Computer science: Adam's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, the sketch doesn't specifically mention an interest in technology. Hence a moderate score of 0.6.

Agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and strong empathy align very well with the typical attributes of a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. Hence a high score of 0.8.
