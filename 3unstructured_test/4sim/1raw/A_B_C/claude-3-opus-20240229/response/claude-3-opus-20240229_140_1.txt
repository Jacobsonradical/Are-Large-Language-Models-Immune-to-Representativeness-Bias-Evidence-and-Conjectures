Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants and animals, as well as his love for animals and strong empathy suggest he may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student.  His intelligence, abstract thinking skills and puzzle-solving align reasonably well with computer science.  The personality sketch provides less evidence of similarity to a typical business administration student.
