Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit him for computer science, though the sketch doesn't specifically mention an interest in that field. Business administration seems less aligned with his personality based on the description provided, as it doesn't highlight interests in that area. Of course, this is just a high-level assessment based on limited information about Adam.
