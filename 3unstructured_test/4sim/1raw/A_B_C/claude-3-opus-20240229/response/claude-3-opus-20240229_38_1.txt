Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would make him somewhat similar to a typical computer science grad student. However, the personality sketch doesn't provide strong evidence that he would be very similar to a typical graduate student in business administration.
