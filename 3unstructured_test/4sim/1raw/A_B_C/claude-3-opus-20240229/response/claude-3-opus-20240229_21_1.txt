Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be a very good fit for graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve him well in computer science, though the personality sketch doesn't mention a specific interest in that field. The description doesn't highlight traits that are strongly associated with typical business administration students.
