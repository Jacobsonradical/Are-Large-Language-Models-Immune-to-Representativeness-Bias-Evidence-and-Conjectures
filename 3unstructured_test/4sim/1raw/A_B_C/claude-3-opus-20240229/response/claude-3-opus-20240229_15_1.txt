Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking seems less aligned with typical business administration students. His puzzle-solving skills and intelligence could fit with computer science. However, his deep curiosity about plants, empathy, and love for animals suggest he is most similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
