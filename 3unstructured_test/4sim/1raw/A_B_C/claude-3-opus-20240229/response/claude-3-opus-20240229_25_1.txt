Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet demeanor and abstract thinking abilities give him some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student. However, the personality sketch provides little indication that he would be very similar to a typical graduate student in business administration.
