Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit him for computer science, though it's not a perfect match. Business administration seems least similar to his personality and interests based on the description provided.
