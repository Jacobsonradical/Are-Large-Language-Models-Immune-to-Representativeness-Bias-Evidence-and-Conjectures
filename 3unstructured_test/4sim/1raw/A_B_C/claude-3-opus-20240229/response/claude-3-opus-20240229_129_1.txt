Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and hard work suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, puzzle-solving skills and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate some similarity to computer science students as well. The personality sketch provides less evidence of overlap with typical business administration students.
