Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest he would be a very good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve him well in computer science, though perhaps to a slightly lesser degree. The personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be a strong match for business administration compared to the other two fields.
