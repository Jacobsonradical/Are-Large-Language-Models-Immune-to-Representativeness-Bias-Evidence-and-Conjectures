Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.

His quiet nature and skill at understanding abstract concepts indicate some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student, though perhaps not as strong a fit as agricultural and veterinary science.

The description doesn't mention much related to business, so he seems less similar to a typical business administration graduate student compared to the other two fields. However, his high intelligence and strong empathy could still serve him well in business.
