Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His abstract thinking skills and intelligence indicate some similarity to computer science students. However, the personality sketch doesn't provide strong evidence of business aptitude or interest, so I rated the similarity to business administration students lower.
