Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles would make him somewhat similar to a typical computer science graduate student. The personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be similar to a typical business administration graduate student, though his understanding and appreciation of hard work and dedication is somewhat relevant to that field.
