Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, his personality sketch emphasizes more his love of nature, animals, and hard work, which seem most aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration seems less similar to his core interests and traits based on the description provided.
