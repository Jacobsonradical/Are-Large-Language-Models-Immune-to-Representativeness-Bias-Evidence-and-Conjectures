Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.

His quiet demeanor, skill at solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts give him some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student.

However, the personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be very similar to a typical graduate student in business administration, as key traits like interpersonal skills, leadership, and interest in business are not mentioned.
