Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. 

His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles indicate some similarity to computer science students, though perhaps not an extremely strong match.

The personality sketch provides less evidence of similarity to business administration students. While Adam's intelligence would serve him well, the sketch does not highlight interests or traits that are strongly associated with typical business students.
