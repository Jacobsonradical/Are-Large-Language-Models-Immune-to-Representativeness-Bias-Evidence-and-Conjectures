Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and skills at solving puzzles also suggest he could do well in computer science, though perhaps not quite as well as in agricultural and veterinary science based on the description. Business administration seems less aligned with his personality and interests compared to the other two fields.
