Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and dedication suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science grad student. His intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts and puzzles indicates some similarity to computer science students as well. However, the personality sketch doesn't highlight traits that seem as relevant for typical business administration students.
