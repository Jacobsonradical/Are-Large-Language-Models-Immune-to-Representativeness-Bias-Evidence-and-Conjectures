Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about plants, and empathy suggest he would be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract concepts indicate some similarity to computer science students. The personality sketch provides less evidence of traits typical of business administration students.
