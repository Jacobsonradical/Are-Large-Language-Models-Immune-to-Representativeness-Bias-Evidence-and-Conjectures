Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The rationale is:

Computer science: Adam's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggests he may have some similarities to computer science students, but his strong empathy and love of nature and animals are less typical, so the similarity is moderate at 0.6.

Business administration: Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with the stereotypical business student. His quiet nature, empathy, and love of nature and animals suggest lower similarity, estimated at 0.3.

Agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's curiosity about plants, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication suggest a strong alignment with students in agricultural and veterinary fields. The similarity is estimated to be high at 0.8.
