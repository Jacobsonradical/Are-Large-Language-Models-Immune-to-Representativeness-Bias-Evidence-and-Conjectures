Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. His abstract thinking skills and intelligence would make him somewhat similar to a typical computer science student. The personality sketch provides less evidence that he would be similar to a typical MBA student, though his empathy and warm heart indicate some similarity.
