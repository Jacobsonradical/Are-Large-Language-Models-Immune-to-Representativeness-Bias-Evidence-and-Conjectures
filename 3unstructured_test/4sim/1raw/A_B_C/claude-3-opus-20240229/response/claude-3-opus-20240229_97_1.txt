Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and dedication suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. His intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts and puzzles indicates some overlap with computer science. The personality sketch provides little to suggest strong similarity to a typical business administration student.
