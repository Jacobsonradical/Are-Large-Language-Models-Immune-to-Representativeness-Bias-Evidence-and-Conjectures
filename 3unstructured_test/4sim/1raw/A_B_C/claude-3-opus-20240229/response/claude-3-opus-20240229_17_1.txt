Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants and animals, as well as his empathy and love for animals, suggests he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.

His intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles indicates he would also have a fair amount in common with typical computer science graduate students. 

The personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be very similar to the typical graduate student in business administration, though his strong work ethic and dedication would serve him well in any field.
