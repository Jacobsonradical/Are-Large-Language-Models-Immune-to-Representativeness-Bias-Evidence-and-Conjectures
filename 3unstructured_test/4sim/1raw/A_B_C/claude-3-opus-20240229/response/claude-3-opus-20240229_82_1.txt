Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, though his other traits seem less aligned with that field. Business administration seems to have the least overlap with the personality traits described for Adam.
