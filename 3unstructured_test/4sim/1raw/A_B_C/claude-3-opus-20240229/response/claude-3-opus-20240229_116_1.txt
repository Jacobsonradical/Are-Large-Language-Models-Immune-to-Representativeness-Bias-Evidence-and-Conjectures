Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

The key factors I considered:

Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, and empathy suggest a strong fit with agricultural and veterinary science. His enjoyment of puzzles and abstract thinking abilities also align decently with computer science. The personality description doesn't highlight traits that are as directly relevant for typical business administration students.
