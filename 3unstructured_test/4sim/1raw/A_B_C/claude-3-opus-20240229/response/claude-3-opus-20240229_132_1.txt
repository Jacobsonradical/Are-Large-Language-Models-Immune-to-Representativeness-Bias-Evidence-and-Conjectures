Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.

His quiet nature and enjoyment of solving puzzles has some overlap with computer science, but the personality sketch doesn't mention a strong interest in technology or programming, so the similarity is moderate.

The description doesn't include much to indicate similarity to a typical business administration student, such as leadership drive, interpersonal skills, or interest in management, finance, etc. So I rated that the lowest in terms of likely similarity based on the given information.
