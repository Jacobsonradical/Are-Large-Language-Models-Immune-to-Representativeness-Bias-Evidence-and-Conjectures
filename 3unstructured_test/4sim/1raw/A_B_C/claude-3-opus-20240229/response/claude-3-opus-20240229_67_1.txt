Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants and animals, which aligns well with a typical agricultural or veterinary science student. His quiet nature, puzzle-solving skills and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit decently well with a typical computer science student profile. The description seems to align least closely with a typical business administration student, though his intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication would serve him well in any field.
