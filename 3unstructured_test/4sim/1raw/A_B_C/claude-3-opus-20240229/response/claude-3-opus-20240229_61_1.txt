Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles indicate some similarity to computer science graduate students, but not as strongly. The personality sketch provides little indication that he would be very similar to a typical business administration graduate student.
