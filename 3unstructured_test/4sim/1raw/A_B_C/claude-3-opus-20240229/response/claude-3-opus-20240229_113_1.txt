Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his love for animals, suggests he may be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend itself to computer science, though perhaps not as strongly. The personality sketch does not provide as much evidence that he would be similar to a typical graduate student in business administration.
