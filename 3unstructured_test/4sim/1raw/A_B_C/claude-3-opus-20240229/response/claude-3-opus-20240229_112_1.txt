Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals along with his dedication and hard work align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student, so I rated that the highest at 0.8. His curiosity, intelligence, and skill at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles match reasonably well with a typical computer science graduate student, so I gave that a 0.6. The personality sketch suggests he is less similar to a typical business administration graduate student, so I rated that the lowest at 0.3.
