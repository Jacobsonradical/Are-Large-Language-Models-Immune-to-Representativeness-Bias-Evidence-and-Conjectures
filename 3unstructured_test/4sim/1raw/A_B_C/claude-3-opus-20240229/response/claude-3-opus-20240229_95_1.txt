Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.

His quiet nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student, but not as strong a fit as agricultural and veterinary science.

While his high intelligence could lend itself to business administration, the personality sketch doesn't provide strong indications that he would be especially similar to a typical graduate student in that field compared to the general population.
