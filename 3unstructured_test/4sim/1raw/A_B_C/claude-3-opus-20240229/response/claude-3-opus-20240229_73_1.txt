Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. 

His intelligence, abstract thinking, and enjoyment of puzzles indicate some similarity to a computer science grad student, but perhaps not as strong a fit.

The personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be similar to a typical business administration grad student.
