Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet nature and aptitude for abstract concepts and problem-solving indicate some similarity to computer science students. The personality sketch provides less evidence of similarity to typical business administration students, though his intelligence and understanding of dedication and hard work suggest some overlap.
