Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. 

His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles indicate some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student.

The personality sketch provides less evidence of similarity to a typical business administration graduate student. While Adam has an appreciation for hard work and dedication, other key traits of business students are not mentioned.
