Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles give him some similarity to a computer science graduate student, though perhaps not an extremely strong similarity. The personality sketch provides the least evidence for similarity to a typical business administration graduate student.
