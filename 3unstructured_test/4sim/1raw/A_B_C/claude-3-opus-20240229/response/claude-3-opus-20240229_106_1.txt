Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts indicate some similarity to computer science students, though perhaps not an ideal match. The personality sketch provides little indication that he would be very similar to a typical graduate student in business administration.
