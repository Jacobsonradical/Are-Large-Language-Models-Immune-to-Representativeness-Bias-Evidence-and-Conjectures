Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

My reasoning:
Business administration: While Adam has a strong work ethic and dedication, his quiet nature and love of puzzles and abstract concepts seem less aligned with the typical extroverted, networking-focused business student.

Agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest a strong fit with this field. His intelligence would serve him well in the scientific aspects.

Computer science: Adam's aptitude for puzzles and abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. His quiet nature is also not uncommon in this field. However, the sketch does not specifically mention a passion for technology or computers.
