Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest Adam may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.

His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles indicate some similarity to a typical computer science graduate student as well, though perhaps not quite as strong a fit as agricultural and veterinary science.

The given personality sketch provides less evidence of similarity to a typical business administration graduate student. While traits like intelligence and appreciation for hard work are certainly relevant, overall the description paints a picture of someone more oriented towards the natural world, animals, and abstract problem-solving than the typical MBA student profile.
