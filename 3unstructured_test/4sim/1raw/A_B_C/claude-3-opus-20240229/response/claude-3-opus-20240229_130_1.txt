Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and dedication suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, puzzle-solving skills and ability to understand abstract concepts also give him things in common with a typical computer science grad student, though to a somewhat lesser degree. His personality seems least similar to that of a typical MBA student, as the sketch doesn't highlight traits like competitiveness, extroversion or leadership that are more common in that field.
