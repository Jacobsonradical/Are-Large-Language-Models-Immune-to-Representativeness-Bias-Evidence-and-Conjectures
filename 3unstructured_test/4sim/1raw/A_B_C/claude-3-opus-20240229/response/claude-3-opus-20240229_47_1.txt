Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also make him somewhat similar to a typical computer science graduate student. However, the personality sketch does not highlight traits that are as strongly associated with business administration, such as leadership, competitiveness, or extroversion.
