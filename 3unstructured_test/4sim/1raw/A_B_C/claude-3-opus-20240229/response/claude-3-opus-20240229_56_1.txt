Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he may be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to computer science, though perhaps not as strongly. The personality sketch provides less evidence that he would be similar to a typical graduate student in business administration.
