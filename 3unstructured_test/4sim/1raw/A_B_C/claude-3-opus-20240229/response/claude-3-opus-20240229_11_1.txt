Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be very similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would make him somewhat similar to a typical computer science graduate student. The personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be similar to a typical graduate student in business administration.
