Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest he would be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would serve him well in computer science, though his personality seems less aligned with the typical computer science student compared to agricultural science. Business administration seems the least similar fit given Adam's quiet nature and the lack of indication of strong leadership, competitiveness or extroversion that is more common in that field.
