Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be a very good fit for graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve him well in computer science, though perhaps not quite as much as in agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration seems the least similar fit based on the description provided, as it doesn't touch on key traits for that field like leadership, communication skills, or interest in management and organizations.
