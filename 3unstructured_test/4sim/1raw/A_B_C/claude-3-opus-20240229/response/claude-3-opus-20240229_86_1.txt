Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His intelligence, abstract thinking skills and enjoyment of puzzles indicate some similarity to computer science students as well. However, the personality sketch provides little evidence that he would be very similar to a typical business administration graduate student.
