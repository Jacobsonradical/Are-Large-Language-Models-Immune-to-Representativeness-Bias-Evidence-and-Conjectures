Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a high similarity to typical graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science.
- His quiet nature, appreciation for hard work and dedication, and high intelligence also align with the traits of students in these fields.
- In contrast, business administration students often focus more on management, finance, and corporate strategies, which do not closely align with Adam's described interests and personality traits. Hence, the lower similarity score for business administration.
