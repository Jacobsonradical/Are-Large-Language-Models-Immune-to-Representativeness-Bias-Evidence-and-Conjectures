Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quietness, abstract thinking skills, and intelligence could fit with business administration to some degree, but overall his profile seems less similar to a typical graduate student in that field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
