Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his deep love for animals, suggests he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. 

On the other hand, while his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be applicable to business administration, the personality sketch does not strongly indicate other traits that are common among business graduate students, such as strong leadership skills, competitiveness, or extroversion. So I rated the similarity lower for that field.
