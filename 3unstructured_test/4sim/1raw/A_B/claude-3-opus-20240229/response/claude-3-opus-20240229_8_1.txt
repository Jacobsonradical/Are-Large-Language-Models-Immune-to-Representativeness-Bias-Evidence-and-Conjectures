Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit well in this field.

Conversely, the personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be similar to a typical graduate student in business administration. While his intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts could be applicable, the sketch does not highlight interests or traits that are strongly characteristic of business students, such as leadership, competitiveness, or extroversion.
