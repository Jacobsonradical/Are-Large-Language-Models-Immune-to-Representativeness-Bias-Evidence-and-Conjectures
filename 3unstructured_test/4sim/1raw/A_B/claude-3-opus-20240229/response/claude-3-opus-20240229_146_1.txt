Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest Adam would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.

Traits like enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could fit many fields. However, the overall profile seems less similar to a typical business administration graduate student, who may be more focused on leadership, management, finance and interpersonal skills.

Of course, this is a generalization based on limited information. Individuals can certainly break the mold of a typical student in their field. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate or modify the assessment in any way.
