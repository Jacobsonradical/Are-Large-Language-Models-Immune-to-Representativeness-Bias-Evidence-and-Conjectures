Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and hard work suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science graduate student. His abstract thinking skills could also apply well to scientific research. However, the personality sketch does not strongly indicate business-oriented traits, so he seems less similar to a typical MBA student.
