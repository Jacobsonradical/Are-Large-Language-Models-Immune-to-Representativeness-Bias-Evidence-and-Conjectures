Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about plants and nature, and strong empathy align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. However, his personality traits seem less aligned with a typical business administration student, who may be more focused on leadership, competition, and financial/management skills rather than abstract thinking and puzzles.
