Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a deep love for animals. This aligns well with typical interests of graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science.

On the other hand, while the sketch indicates Adam is intelligent and has an appreciation for hard work, it doesn't provide strong evidence of entrepreneurial drive, leadership skills, or interest in management, finance, and other business-related topics that are more typical of graduate students in business administration.
