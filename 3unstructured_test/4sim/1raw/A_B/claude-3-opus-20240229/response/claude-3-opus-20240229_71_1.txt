Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals along with his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His personality traits seem less aligned with a typical graduate student in business administration, though his understanding of hard work and dedication would be relevant in that field as well.
