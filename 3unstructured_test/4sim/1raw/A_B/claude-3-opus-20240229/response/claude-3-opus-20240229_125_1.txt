Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding natural concepts suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science graduate student. His quiet demeanor, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving may be less typical of business administration students, who often need strong interpersonal and practical business skills. Of course, there is diversity within any field.
