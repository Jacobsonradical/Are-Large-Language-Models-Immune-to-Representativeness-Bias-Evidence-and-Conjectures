Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with his strong empathy, suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, love of puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit decently in business administration, but seem a bit less typical for that field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
