Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding abstract concepts seems much more aligned with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student than a business administration student. His quiet and empathetic personality also seems more common in agricultural and veterinary fields. However, his intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could lend themselves to business administration to some degree.
