Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and strong sense of empathy suggest he would be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are also valuable traits in this field. However, business administration seems less aligned with his personality and interests based on the description provided.
