Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem very well aligned with a typical agricultural or veterinary science graduate student. His quiet demeanor, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving inclination are less typical of a business administration student, who may tend to be more outgoing and focused on practical rather than abstract concepts. Of course, there is diversity within any field, but based on the sketch, Adam seems to align much more closely with the profile of an agricultural/veterinary science grad student.
