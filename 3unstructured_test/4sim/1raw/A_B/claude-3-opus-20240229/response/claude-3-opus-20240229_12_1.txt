Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with his deep love for animals, suggests he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, warmth, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit well in that field.

While his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be applicable in business administration, his overall profile seems less similar to a typical graduate student in that field based on the personality sketch provided. Business administration does not seem to align as directly with his core interests and traits.
