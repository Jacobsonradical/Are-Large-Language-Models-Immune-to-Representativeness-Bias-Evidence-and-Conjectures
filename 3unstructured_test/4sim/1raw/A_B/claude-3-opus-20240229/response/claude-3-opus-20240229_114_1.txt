Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's strong interest in nature, plants and animals, as well as his empathy and love for animals, suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His abstract thinking skills could also be useful in this field.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not provide strong indications that Adam would be very similar to a typical graduate student in business administration. His quiet nature and interests in puzzles, nature and animals do not align as closely with common traits for business students. However, his intelligence, hard work and dedication could serve him well in any graduate program.
