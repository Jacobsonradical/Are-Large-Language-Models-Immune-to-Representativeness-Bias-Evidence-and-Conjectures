Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science graduate student. His abstract thinking skills could also be useful in those fields for research.

Conversely, the description doesn't mention much affinity for business, management, finance, or related skills and interests that would be more common for a business administration graduate student. Problem solving skills could translate to business to some degree, but overall the similarities seem lower based on the personality sketch provided.
