Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and dedication suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural/veterinary science grad student. His abstract thinking ability could fit business administration to some degree, but overall his profile seems less similar to a typical MBA student.
