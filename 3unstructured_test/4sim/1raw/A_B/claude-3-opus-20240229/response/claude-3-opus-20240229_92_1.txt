Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science grad student. His abstract thinking and intelligence could fit business administration to some degree, but his overall profile seems less typical for that field based on the description provided.
