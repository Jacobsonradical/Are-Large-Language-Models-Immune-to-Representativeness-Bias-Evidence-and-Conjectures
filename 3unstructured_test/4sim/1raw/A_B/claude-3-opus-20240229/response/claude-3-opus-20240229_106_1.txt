Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals along with his curiosity, intelligence and appreciation for hard work align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His abstract thinking and puzzle-solving point slightly less toward business administration, though his intelligence would serve him well there too.
