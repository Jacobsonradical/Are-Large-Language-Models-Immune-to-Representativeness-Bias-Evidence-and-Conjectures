Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and strong empathy seem much more aligned with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student than a business administration student. His abstract thinking skills could lend themselves to either field to some degree. But overall, his personality and interests appear to be a much stronger fit for agricultural and veterinary science.
