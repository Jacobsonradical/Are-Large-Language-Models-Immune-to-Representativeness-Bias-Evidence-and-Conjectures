Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with his deep love for animals, suggests he would be very similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet nature, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit decently with business administration, but the overall profile seems much more aligned with someone pursuing graduate studies related to nature, plants, animals and veterinary science.
