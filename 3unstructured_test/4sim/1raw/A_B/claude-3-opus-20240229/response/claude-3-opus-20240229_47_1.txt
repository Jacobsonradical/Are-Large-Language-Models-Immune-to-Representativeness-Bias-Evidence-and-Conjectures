Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet demeanor, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving point less towards business administration, though his intelligence could lend itself to various fields.
