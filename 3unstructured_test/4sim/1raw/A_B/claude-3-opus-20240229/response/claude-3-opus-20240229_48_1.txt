Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science grad student. His quiet demeanor, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving point less toward business administration, though his intelligence would serve him well in any field.
