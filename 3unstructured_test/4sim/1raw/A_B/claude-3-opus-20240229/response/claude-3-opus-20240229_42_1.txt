Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet personality and focus on puzzles and abstract concepts seem less aligned with the interpersonal and practical focuses typical in business administration.
