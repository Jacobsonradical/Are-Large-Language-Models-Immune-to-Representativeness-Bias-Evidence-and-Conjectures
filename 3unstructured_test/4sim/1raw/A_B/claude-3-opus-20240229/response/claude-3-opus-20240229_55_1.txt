Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about plants and nature, and strong empathy align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. However, the personality sketch does not provide strong evidence of Adam having typical traits of a business administration student, such as leadership drive, competitiveness, or extroversion. His quiet demeanor and focus on abstract concepts suggest a lower similarity to the typical business administration graduate student profile.
