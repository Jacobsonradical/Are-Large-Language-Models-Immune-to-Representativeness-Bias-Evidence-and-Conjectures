Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, and his strong empathy align well with a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit well in this field.

While his high intelligence and strong understanding of hard work and dedication could serve him well in business administration, his overall profile based on the personality sketch seems less aligned with a typical graduate student in that field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
