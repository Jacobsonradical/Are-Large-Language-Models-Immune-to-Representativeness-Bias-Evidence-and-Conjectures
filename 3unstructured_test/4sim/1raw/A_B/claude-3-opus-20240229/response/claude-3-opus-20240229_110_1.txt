Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet demeanor, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit well in that field.

Conversely, the personality sketch does not highlight traits that are typically associated with business administration, such as assertiveness, competitiveness, or leadership skills. So he seems less similar to a typical graduate student in that area. However, his intelligence, work ethic and ability to understand abstract concepts would still be relevant assets in business.
