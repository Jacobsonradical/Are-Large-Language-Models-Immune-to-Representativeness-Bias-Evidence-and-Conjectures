Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, animals, and his empathy seem very well aligned with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His curiosity, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also fit well in this field.

In contrast, the personality sketch doesn't highlight traits that are as stereotypically associated with business administration, such as competitiveness, assertiveness, or extroversion. So while his intelligence and hard work would certainly be assets, overall he seems less similar to a typical graduate student in that field based on the description provided.
