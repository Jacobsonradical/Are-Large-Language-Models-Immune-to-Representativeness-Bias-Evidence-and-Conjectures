Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication seem much more aligned with a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student than a business administration student. However, his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would serve him well in either field to some degree.
