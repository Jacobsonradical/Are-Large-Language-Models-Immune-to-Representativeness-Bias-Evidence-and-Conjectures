Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also align well with this field.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not highlight strong similarities to a typical business administration graduate student. While understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication is certainly relevant, many of Adam's other traits like being quiet, empathetic and puzzle-solving are less directly aligned with business administration.
