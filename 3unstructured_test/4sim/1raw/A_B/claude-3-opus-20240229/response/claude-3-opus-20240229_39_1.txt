Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about plants and nature, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. 

His abstract thinking skills could be useful in business administration, but overall his personality seems less well-aligned with that field compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration students may be more externally focused on organizations and leadership rather than having a deep curiosity about nature.
