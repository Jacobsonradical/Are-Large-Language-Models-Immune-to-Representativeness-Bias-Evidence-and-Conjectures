Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His abstract thinking skills could also be valuable in this field for research.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not strongly indicate business-oriented traits, so he seems less similar to a typical MBA student. Problem-solving skills and intelligence would be assets, but overall the description paints a picture of someone more aligned with agriculture/veterinary studies than business.
