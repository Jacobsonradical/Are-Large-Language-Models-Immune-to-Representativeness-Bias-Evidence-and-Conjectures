Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong curiosity about nature, plants and animals, as well as his deep love for animals, suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, skill at understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit well in this field.

Conversely, the personality sketch does not emphasize traits that are often associated with business administration, such as extroversion, competitiveness, or leadership skills. So he seems less similar to a typical graduate student in that field, though his intelligence and problem-solving abilities would still be assets.
