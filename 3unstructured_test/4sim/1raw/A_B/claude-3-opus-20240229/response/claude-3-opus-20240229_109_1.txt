Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, seem to align well with a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His abstract thinking skills could also be useful in this field for research and problem-solving.

On the other hand, while his intelligence and problem-solving skills could be assets in business administration, his quiet nature and interests seem less aligned with the typical graduate student in that field, which is why I gave a lower similarity score.
