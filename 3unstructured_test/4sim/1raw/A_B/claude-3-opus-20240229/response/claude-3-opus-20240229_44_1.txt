Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants and love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science graduate student. His quiet nature, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit decently with business administration, but seems less aligned than agricultural and veterinary science based on the description provided.
