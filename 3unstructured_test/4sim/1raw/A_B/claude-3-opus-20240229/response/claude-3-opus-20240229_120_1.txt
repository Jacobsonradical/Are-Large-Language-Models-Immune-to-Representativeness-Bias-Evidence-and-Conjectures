Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and dedication suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His abstract thinking ability could fit with business administration to some degree, but overall his personality seems less similar to the typical graduate student in that field.
