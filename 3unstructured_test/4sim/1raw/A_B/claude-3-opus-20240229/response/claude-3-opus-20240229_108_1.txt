Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and abstract concepts seems much more aligned with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student than a business administration student. His quiet demeanor and puzzle-solving interests also fit that profile better. However, his strong work ethic and dedication could align with business administration to some degree.
