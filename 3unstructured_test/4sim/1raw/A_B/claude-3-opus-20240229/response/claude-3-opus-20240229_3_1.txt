Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and strong empathy align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet demeanor, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit this field.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not strongly indicate traits commonly associated with business administration such as extroversion, competitiveness, or leadership skills. Problem-solving abilities could translate to business, but overall he seems less similar to a typical MBA student.
