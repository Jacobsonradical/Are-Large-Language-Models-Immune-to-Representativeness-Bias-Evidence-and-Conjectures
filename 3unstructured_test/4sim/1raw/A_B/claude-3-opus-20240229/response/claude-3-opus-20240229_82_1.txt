Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as his appreciation for hard work, seem much more aligned with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student than a business administration student. His quiet demeanor, love of puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with either field to some degree, but overall his profile seems to match more closely with an agricultural and veterinary science student.
