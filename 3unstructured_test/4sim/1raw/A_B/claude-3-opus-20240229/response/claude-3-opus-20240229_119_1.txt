Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, abstract thinking skills, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with graduate study in business administration to some degree, but the overall personality sketch seems less aligned with that field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
