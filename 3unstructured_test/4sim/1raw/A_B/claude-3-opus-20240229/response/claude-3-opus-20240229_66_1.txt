Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and love for animals, suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.

His quiet demeanor, interest in puzzles and abstract concepts, and high intelligence could fit with business administration to some degree. However, the personality sketch emphasizes more his connection with nature and animals rather than typical business-related traits and interests. So I rate the similarity lower for business administration.
