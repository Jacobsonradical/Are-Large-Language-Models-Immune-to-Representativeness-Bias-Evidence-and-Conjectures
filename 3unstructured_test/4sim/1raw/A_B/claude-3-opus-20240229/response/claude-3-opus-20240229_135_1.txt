Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His abstract thinking skills could also be relevant in this field for research.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not mention much affinity for topics like management, finance, marketing or other business-related skills, so he seems less similar to a typical graduate student in business administration. Problem-solving skills and intelligence are certainly useful in business, but overall the description paints a picture of someone more aligned with scientific fields.
