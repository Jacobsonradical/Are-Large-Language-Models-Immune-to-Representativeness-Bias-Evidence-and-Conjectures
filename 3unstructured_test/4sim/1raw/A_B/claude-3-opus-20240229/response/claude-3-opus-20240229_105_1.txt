Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants and animals, as well as his strong empathy and love for animals, seem very well aligned with a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, puzzle-solving skills, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also be assets in this field.

While Adam's intelligence and hard work ethic could serve him well in business administration, his overall personality and interests don't seem as strongly aligned with the typical graduate student profile in that field, compared to agricultural and veterinary science. His introversion and emphasis on empathy over assertiveness or competitiveness may not match the stereotypical business student.

Of course, there is a wide range of individual variation in every field. But based solely on the limited information provided, agricultural and veterinary science seems a significantly closer match for Adam than business administration.
