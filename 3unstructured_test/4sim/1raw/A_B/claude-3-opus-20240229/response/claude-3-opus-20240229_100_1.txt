Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve him well in this field. However, his personality traits seem less aligned with typical business administration students, who may be more outgoing and focused on leadership, management, and financial concepts.
