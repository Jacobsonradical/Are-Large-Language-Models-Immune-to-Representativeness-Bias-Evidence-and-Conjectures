Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as his deep love for animals, suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, puzzle-solving skills, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit well in this field.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not highlight traits that are as strongly associated with business administration, such as assertiveness, competitiveness, or leadership skills. While his intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant, overall he seems to have less in common with a typical graduate student in this field based on the description provided.
