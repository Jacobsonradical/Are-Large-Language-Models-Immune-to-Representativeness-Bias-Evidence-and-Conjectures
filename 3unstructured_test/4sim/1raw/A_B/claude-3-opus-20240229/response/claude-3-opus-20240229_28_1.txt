Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest Adam may be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. 

His quiet nature, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with business administration to some degree, but seem less indicative of that field specifically compared to agricultural and veterinary science, based on the description provided.
