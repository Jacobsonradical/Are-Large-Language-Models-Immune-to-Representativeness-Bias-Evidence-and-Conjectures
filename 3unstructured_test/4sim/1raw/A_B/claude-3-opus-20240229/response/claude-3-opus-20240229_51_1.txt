Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and strong empathy align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet demeanor, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit that field.

On the other hand, the personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be similar to a typical graduate student in business administration. His abstract thinking skills could be applicable, but overall the description paints a picture of someone more aligned with the life sciences than business.
