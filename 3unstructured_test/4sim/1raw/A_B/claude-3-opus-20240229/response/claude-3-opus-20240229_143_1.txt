Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and his empathy and curiosity suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His puzzle-solving skills, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also fit well in this field.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not highlight traits that are as strongly associated with typical business administration graduate students, such as competitiveness, assertiveness, or leadership drive. So I rated the similarity lower for that field. Of course, this is just a high-level guess based on limited information about Adam and general stereotypes of each field.
