Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem well-aligned with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quieter demeanor, empathy and puzzle-solving skills are less typical of business administration students who often tend to be more outgoing and focused on leadership, strategy and finance. However, his high intelligence would serve him well in either field.
