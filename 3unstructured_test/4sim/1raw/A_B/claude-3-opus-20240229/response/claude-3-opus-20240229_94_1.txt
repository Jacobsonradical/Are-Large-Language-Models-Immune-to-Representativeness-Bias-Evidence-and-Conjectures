Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, intelligence, and interest in abstract concepts could fit with business administration to some degree, but the overall description seems less aligned with the typical profile for that field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
