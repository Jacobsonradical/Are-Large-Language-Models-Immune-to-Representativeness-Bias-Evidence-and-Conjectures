Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. 

His abstract thinking skills could be useful in business, but overall his personality seems less aligned with a typical business administration student, who may be more outgoing and business-oriented rather than quiet and nature-focused.
