Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants and animals, as well as his strong empathy, suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, love of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with either field to some degree, but seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration, based on the description provided.
