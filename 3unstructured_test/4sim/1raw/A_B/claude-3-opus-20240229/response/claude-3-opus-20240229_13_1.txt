Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Explanation:
Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His personality traits align well with someone who would be drawn to studying and working with animals and in nature.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not highlight traits that are as strongly associated with typical business administration students, such as competitiveness, assertiveness, or entrepreneurial drive. While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant, overall he seems to have less in common with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student compared to an agricultural/veterinary science student based on the details provided.
