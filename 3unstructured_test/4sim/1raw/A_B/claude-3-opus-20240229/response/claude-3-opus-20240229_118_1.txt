Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as his deep love for animals, suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, propensity for solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well in either field, but seem less central to business administration. His strong empathy and warm heart also seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. While his intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are valued in both fields, overall his profile seems considerably more similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student than to one in business administration.
