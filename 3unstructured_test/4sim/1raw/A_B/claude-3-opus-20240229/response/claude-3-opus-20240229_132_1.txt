Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals along with his empathy and curiosity align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His abstract thinking skills could also be beneficial in this field for research.

Conversely, while Adam's intelligence could serve him well in business administration, his quiet nature and interests don't seem to align as strongly with the typical profile of an MBA student, which is why I rated the similarity lower for that field. Of course, there is diversity in every field.
