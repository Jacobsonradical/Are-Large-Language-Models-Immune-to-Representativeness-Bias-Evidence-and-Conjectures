Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding abstract concepts seems much more aligned with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student than a business administration student. However, his appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with either field to some degree.
