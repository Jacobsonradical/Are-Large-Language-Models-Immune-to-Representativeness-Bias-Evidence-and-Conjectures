Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, plants and animals along with his curiosity, intelligence and understanding of hard work suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His abstract thinking skills could also apply well in this field.

Conversely, the personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be similar to a typical business administration graduate student. His quiet demeanor and interests in puzzles, nature and animals do not align as strongly with common traits for business administration. However, his intelligence and appreciation of dedication and hard work would serve him well in any graduate program.
