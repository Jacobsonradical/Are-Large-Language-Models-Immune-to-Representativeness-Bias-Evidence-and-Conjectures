Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with his strong empathy and love for animals, suggests he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit well in that field.

While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be applicable in business administration, his overall personality and interests seem less aligned with the typical graduate student in that area, based on the description provided.
