Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and dedication seem more aligned with a typical agricultural or veterinary science graduate student. His quiet demeanor, curiosity and abstract thinking skills could fit with business administration to some degree, but overall his profile seems less similar to a typical MBA student.
