Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants and animals, along with his deep love for animals, suggests he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication also seem well-suited to this field.

Conversely, while his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be applicable to business administration, the other traits mentioned in the personality sketch do not seem as strongly aligned with a typical graduate student in that field. Problem-solving skills are certainly valuable in business, but overall the description paints a picture of someone more inclined towards agricultural and veterinary science.
