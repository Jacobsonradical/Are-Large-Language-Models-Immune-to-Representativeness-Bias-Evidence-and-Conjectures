Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and his strong sense of empathy suggest he would be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor and interest in abstract concepts are less typical of business administration students, who often need to be outgoing and focused on practical applications.
