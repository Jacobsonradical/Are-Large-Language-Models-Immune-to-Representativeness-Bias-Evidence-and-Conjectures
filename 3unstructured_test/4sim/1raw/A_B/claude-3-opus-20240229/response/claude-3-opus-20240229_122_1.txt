Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and his strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His abstract thinking skills could also be useful in this field for research.

On the other hand, the personality sketch doesn't highlight traits that are as strongly associated with typical business administration students, such as competitiveness, assertiveness, or entrepreneurial drive. While his intelligence would serve him well, overall he seems to have less in common with the typical graduate student in that field based on the description provided.
