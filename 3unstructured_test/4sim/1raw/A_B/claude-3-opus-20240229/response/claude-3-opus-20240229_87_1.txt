Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his deep love for animals, and his strong empathy align well with the typical interests and qualities of a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve him well in this field.

In contrast, while Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication could be assets in business administration, his overall personality and interests seem less aligned with the typical graduate student in that field. His quiet nature and focus on puzzles and animals do not match the stereotypical extroverted, networking-focused business student.

Of course, this is a generalization based on limited information. Individuals can certainly succeed in and enjoy fields that may not seem like a stereotypical fit for their personality. But based solely on the sketch provided, I believe Adam has more in common with a typical agricultural/veterinary science grad student than with a typical business administration one.
