Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Explanation:
Adam's love of nature, animals, and his strong empathy suggest he would be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet nature and abstract thinking abilities are less typical of business administration, which tends to attract more outgoing and concrete thinkers, so the similarity there is lower.
