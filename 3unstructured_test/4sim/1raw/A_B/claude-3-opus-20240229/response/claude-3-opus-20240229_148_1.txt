Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and love for animals, seem very well aligned with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His abstract thinking skills could also be useful in this field for research.

While Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills could be assets in business administration, his other traits seem less typical of graduate students in that field, who may be more extroverted and business-oriented. So I rated the similarity lower for business administration.
