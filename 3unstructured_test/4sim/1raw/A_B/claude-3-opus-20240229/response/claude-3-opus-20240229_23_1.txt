Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit well in this field.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not provide strong indications that Adam would be very similar to a typical graduate student in business administration. His empathy, puzzle-solving skills, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be somewhat relevant, but overall the description paints a picture of someone more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.
