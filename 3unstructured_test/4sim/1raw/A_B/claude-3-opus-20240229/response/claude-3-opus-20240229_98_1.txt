Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His abstract thinking skills could also be an asset in this field.

Business administration seems less aligned with Adam's core interests and personality traits like quiet puzzle-solving and empathy. While his intelligence would serve him well, overall he seems to have less in common with a typical graduate student in this field.
