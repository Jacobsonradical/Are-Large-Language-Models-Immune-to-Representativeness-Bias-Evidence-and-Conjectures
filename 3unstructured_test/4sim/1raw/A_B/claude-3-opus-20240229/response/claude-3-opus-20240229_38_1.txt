Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His abstract thinking skills could also be relevant in this field for research.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not highlight traits that are stereotypically associated with business administration, such as competitiveness, assertiveness, or extroversion. Problem-solving skills could be relevant, but overall he seems less similar to a typical MBA student archetype based on the description provided.
