Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals aligns well with the interests of a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also be very applicable in this field. 

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not provide strong evidence that Adam has the typical traits and interests of a business administration graduate student. While his intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication are relevant, other key traits like leadership, competitiveness, and extroversion are not mentioned. His puzzle-solving ability and warm heart also seem less directly applicable to business compared to agricultural science.

Of course, this is just my assessment based on the limited information provided about Adam. Many additional factors beyond this brief personality sketch would influence his actual similarity to typical graduate students in any given field.
