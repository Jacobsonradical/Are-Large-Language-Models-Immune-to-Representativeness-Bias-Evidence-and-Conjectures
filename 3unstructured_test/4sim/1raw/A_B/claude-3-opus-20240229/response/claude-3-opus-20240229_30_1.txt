Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His abstract thinking skills could also fit well in this field for research. 

On the other hand, the description doesn't mention much affinity for business, management, finance, etc. His quiet demeanor and focus on nature/animals over business topics makes him seem less similar to a typical MBA student. However, his intelligence and work ethic would still serve him well in business school.
