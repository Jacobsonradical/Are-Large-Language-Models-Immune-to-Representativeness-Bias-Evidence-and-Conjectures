Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as his deep love for animals, suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit well in this field.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not mention traits that are often associated with business administration, such as strong leadership skills, assertiveness, competitiveness or entrepreneurial drive. While his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be applicable in business, overall he seems to have less in common with a typical graduate student in that field based on the description provided.
