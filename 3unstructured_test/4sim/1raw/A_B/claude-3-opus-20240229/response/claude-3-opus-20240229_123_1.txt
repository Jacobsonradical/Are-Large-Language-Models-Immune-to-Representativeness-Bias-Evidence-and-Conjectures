Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. However, his personality seems less similar to a typical business administration grad student, as the description doesn't mention traits like competitiveness, assertiveness, or interest in finance and management that are more common in that field.
