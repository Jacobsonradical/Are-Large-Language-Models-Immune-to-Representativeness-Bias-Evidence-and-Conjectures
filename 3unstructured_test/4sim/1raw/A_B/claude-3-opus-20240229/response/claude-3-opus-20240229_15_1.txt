Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet demeanor, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit well in this field.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not highlight traits that are as strongly associated with business administration, such as competitiveness, assertiveness, or leadership skills. Problem-solving skills could be relevant, but overall he seems to have less in common with a typical graduate student in this field based on the description provided.
