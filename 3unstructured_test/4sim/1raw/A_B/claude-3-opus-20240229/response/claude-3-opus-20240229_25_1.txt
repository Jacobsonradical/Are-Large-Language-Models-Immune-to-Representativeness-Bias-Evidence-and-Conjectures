Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet nature, abstract thinking skills, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit decently with business administration, but the overall profile seems less similar to a typical graduate student in that field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
