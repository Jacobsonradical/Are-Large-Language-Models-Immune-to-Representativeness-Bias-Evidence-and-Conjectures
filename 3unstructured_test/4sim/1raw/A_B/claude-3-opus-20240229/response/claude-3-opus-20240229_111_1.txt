Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet demeanor, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts would also fit well in this field.

Conversely, the personality sketch does not highlight traits that are as strongly associated with typical business administration graduate students, such as extroversion, competitiveness, or leadership skills. Problem-solving ability could be relevant, but overall Adam seems to align less closely with this field based on the information provided.
