Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and love for animals, suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet nature, puzzle-solving skills, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit decently with business administration, but the overall profile seems to align more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science.
