Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for nature, animals, and his curiosity align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His strong empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also qualities that would fit well in this field.

On the other hand, while his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be applicable to business administration, the personality sketch does not strongly indicate an interest in or inclination towards typical business-related traits or activities. Therefore, the similarity to a business administration graduate student is rated lower.
