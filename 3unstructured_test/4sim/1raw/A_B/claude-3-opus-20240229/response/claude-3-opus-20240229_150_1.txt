Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem more aligned with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet personality and abstract thinking abilities could fit either field to some degree, but overall his profile seems less similar to a typical business administration student.
