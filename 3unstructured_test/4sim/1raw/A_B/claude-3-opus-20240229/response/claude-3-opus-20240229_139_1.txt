Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, abstract thinking skills, and high intelligence are less typical of business administration graduate students, who often need strong interpersonal and concrete, pragmatic thinking skills.
