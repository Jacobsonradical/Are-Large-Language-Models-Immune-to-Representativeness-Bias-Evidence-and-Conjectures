Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also fit well in this field.

Conversely, while his intelligence could be an asset, the personality sketch does not highlight traits that are as stereotypically associated with business administration, such as competitiveness, extroversion, or leadership skills. So I assess his similarity there as lower.

Of course, any individual can be suited for a variety of fields. This is just my best estimate based on limited information and generalized assumptions about each field. Let me know if you would like me to explain my reasoning further!
