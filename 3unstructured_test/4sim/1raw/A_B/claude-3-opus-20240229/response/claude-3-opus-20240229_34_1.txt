Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants and animals, along with his deep love for animals, suggests he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His warm heart, strong empathy, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit well in that field.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not mention traits that are stereotypically associated with business administration, such as strong leadership skills, assertiveness, or interest in finance and management. So he seems less similar to a typical graduate student in that field. However, his intelligence, puzzle-solving ability and appreciation for hard work and dedication could still be relevant in business administration to some degree.
