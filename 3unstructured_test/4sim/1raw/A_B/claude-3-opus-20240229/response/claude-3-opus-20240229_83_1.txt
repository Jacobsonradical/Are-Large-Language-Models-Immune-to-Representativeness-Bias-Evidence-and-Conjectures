Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding abstract concepts suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His personality seems less similar to a typical business administration student, who may be more focused on practical applications, leadership, and interpersonal skills rather than abstract concepts and love of nature.
