Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His abstract thinking skills could also be relevant in this field.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not emphasize traits that are stereotypically associated with business administration, such as competitiveness, assertiveness, or extrinsic motivation. So he seems less similar to a typical graduate student in that field based on the limited information provided.
