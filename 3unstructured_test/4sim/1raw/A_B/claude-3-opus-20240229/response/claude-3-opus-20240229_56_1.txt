Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication seem to align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet demeanor, curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit decently with business administration, but the overall profile seems to match agricultural and veterinary science more closely based on the details provided.
