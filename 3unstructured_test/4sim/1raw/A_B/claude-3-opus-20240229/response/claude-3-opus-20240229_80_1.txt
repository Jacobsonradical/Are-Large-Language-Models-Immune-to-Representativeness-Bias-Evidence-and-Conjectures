Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy, suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit well in this field.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not provide strong indications that Adam would be very similar to a typical graduate student in business administration. His abstract thinking skills could be applicable, but overall, his personality and interests seem less aligned with this field.
