Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's strong curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and high intelligence suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, abstract thinking skills, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit well in this field.

In contrast, the personality sketch provides less evidence that Adam would be similar to a typical graduate student in business administration. His warm heart and strong empathy are positive traits but not necessarily key characteristics for success in business. Problem-solving skills are valuable in business, but the description of Adam enjoying puzzles is fairly generic. Overall, he seems to have more traits associated with agricultural/veterinary studies than business.
