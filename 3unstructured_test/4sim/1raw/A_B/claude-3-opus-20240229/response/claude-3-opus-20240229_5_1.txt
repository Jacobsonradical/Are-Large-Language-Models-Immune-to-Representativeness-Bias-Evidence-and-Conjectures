Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and his strong empathy suggest he would be more similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to either field, but overall his personality seems more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.
