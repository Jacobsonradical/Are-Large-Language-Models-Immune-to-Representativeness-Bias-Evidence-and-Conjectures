Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

My reasoning:
Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathetic personality, he seems much more aligned with a typical agricultural/veterinary science graduate student than a business administration student. His curiosity, intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could lend themselves to either field to some degree, but overall his profile is much more consistent with someone who would gravitate towards agricultural and veterinary studies rather than business.
