Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem well-aligned with a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His personality traits appear less similar to a typical graduate student in business administration, who may be more focused on leadership, competitiveness, and financial/management concepts rather than abstract scientific concepts and empathy for animals.
