Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit well in this field.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not mention traits that are stereotypically associated with business administration, such as extroversion, competitiveness, or interest in finance and management. So he seems less similar to a typical graduate student in that field. However, his intelligence, puzzle-solving skills and appreciation for hard work and dedication could still serve him well in business administration to some degree.
