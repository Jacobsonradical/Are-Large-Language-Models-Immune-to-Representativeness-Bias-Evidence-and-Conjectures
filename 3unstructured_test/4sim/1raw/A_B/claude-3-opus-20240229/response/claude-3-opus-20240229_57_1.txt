Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about plants and nature, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His abstract thinking skills could also be valuable in this field.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not highlight traits that are stereotypically associated with business administration, such as competitiveness, assertiveness, or extroversion. Adam's quiet nature and focus on abstract concepts over interpersonal dynamics suggest he may be less similar to a typical graduate student in business administration. However, his intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant to success in any field.
