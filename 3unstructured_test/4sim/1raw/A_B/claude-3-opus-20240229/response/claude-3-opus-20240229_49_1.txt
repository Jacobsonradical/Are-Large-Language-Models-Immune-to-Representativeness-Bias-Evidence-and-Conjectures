Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals aligns well with a student of agricultural and veterinary science. His empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also traits that would serve well in this field. 

Business administration seems less aligned with his personality and interests based on the description provided. While his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be an asset, the sketch does not emphasize traits like competitiveness, assertiveness, or strong interpersonal skills that are often associated with business.

Of course, this is just a high-level assessment based on limited information. Graduate students in any field can have a diverse range of personalities, interests and strengths.
