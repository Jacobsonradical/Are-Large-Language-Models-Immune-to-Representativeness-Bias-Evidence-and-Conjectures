Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quietness, abstract thinking skills, and puzzle-solving inclination seem less typical of business administration graduate students, who may tend to be more outgoing and concrete in their thinking and interests.
