Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His quiet demeanor, fondness for solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with some business administration students, but overall seem less typical for that field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
