Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science graduate student. His strong empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication also seem well-suited for this field.

In contrast, the personality sketch doesn't highlight traits that are as strongly associated with typical business administration students, such as leadership drive, competitiveness, or extroversion. So I assessed a lower similarity score for that field, although his intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would still be assets.

Of course, this is just my interpretation based on the limited information provided. Individuals can certainly succeed in fields even if their personality differs from the average student. Let me know if you would like me to explain my reasoning further.
