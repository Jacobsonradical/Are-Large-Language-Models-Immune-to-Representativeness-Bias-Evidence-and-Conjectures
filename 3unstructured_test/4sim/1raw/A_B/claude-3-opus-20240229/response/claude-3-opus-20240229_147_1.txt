Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about plants and nature, and strong empathy align well with a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. However, the personality sketch does not provide strong evidence of business aptitude or interest, so the similarity to a business administration student is rated lower.
