Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science grad student. His abstract thinking skills could fit business administration to some degree, but overall his personality seems less similar to the typical profile for that field.
