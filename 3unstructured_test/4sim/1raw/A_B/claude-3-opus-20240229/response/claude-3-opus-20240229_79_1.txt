Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with his strong empathy and deep love for animals, makes him quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit well with this field of study.

On the other hand, while his high intelligence and strong understanding of hard work and dedication could be applicable to business administration, the personality sketch does not emphasize traits that are often associated with typical business administration students, such as extroversion, competitiveness, or a strong interest in finance and management. Therefore, I assess his similarity to a typical graduate student in business administration as relatively low.
