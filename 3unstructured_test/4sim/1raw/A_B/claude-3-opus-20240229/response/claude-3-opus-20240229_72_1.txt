Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for nature, plants and animals along with his curiosity, intelligence and appreciation for hard work suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His abstract thinking skills could lend themselves to certain areas of business administration, but overall his personality seems less aligned with the typical business administration graduate student profile.
