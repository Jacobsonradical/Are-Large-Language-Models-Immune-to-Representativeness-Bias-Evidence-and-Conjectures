Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, intelligence, and interest in abstract concepts could fit reasonably well with business administration, but the overall sketch paints a picture of someone more aligned with agricultural and veterinary pursuits.
