Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. However, his personality seems less similar to a typical graduate student in business administration, who may be more focused on leadership, networking, and financial/management concepts rather than abstract ideas and empathy.
