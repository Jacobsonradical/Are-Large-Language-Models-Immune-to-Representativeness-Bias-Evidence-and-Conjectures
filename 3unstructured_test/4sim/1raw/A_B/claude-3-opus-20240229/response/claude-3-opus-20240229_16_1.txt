Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for nature, animals, and his curiosity seem well-aligned with a student in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve him well in this field. 

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not highlight traits that are as strongly associated with business administration, such as competitiveness, extroversion, or risk-taking. While his intelligence and appreciation for hard work would be assets, overall he seems less similar to a typical graduate student in that field based on the information provided.
