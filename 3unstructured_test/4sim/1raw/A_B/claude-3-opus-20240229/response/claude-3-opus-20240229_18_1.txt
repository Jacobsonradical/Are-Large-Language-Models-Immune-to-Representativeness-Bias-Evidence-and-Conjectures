Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals suggests he would be a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are also relevant traits. However, business administration seems less aligned with his personality and interests based on the description provided.
