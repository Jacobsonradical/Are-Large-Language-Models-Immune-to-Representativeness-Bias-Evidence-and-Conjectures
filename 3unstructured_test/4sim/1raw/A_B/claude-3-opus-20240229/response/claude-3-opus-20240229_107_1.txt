Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and his curiosity seem well-aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also fit well. Business administration seems less aligned with his personality and interests based on the description provided.
