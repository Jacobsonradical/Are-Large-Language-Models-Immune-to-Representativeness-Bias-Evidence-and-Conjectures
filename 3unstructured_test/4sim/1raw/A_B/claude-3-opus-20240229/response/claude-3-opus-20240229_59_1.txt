Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and love for animals, suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, puzzle-solving skills, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit well in that field.

Conversely, the personality sketch does not emphasize traits that are often associated with business administration, such as assertiveness, competitiveness, social skills, leadership drive, or interest in finance and management. So he seems less similar to a typical graduate student in that field. However, his intelligence, dedication and hard work could still serve him well in business administration to some degree.
