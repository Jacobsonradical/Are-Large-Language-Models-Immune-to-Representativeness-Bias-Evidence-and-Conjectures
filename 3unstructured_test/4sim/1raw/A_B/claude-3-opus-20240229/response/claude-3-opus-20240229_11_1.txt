Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love for animals, curiosity about plants and nature, and strong empathy suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science. His abstract thinking skills could also be valuable in this field for research.

On the other hand, the personality sketch does not highlight traits that are as strongly associated with typical graduate students in business administration, such as leadership drive, competitiveness, or extroversion. While his intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication are relevant, overall he seems to align less closely with this field based on the description provided.
