Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's love of nature, animals, and understanding natural concepts suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science graduate student. His quiet personality and focus on puzzles and abstract concepts seems less typical of an average business administration graduate student, who may be more extroverted and focused on practical applications.
