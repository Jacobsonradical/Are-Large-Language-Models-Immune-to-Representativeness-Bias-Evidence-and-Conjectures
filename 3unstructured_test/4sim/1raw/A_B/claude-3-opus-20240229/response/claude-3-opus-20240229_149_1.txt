Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural and veterinary science grad student. His quiet personality, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also compatible with this field.

Conversely, the personality sketch does not highlight traits that are strongly associated with typical business administration students, such as extroversion, competitiveness, or leadership skills. Problem-solving and intelligence are relevant but overall the description suggests Adam is less similar to a typical MBA student.
