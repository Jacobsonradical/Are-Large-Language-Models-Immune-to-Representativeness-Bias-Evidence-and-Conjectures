Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants and deep love for animals suggests he would be quite similar to a typical agricultural or veterinary science grad student. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also fit well.

On the other hand, the personality sketch doesn't mention much suggesting similarity to a typical business administration student. While his intelligence would be an asset, the description doesn't highlight interests or traits that seem to align strongly with business.
