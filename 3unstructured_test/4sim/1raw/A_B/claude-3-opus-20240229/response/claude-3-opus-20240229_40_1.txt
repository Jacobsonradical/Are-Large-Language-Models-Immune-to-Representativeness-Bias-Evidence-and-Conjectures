Here is my assessment of how similar Adam is to a typical graduate student in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals along with his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he would be quite similar to a typical graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.

His personality traits seem less aligned with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student, though his intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication would be relevant. Overall he seems to have more in common with an agricultural/veterinary science student based on the description provided.
