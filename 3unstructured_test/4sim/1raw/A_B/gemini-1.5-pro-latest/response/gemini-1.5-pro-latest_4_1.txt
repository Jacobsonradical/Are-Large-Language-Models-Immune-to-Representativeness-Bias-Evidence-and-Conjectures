**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence and work ethic could translate to business, his personality description doesn't strongly align with typical business administration student interests.  There's no mention of an interest in finance, marketing, or management. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love of animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy make him highly similar to a typical graduate student in this field.  His intellectual strengths would also be valuable in this area.
