Based on recent trends and data from various educational reports, here are my best estimates for the percentage of graduate students enrolled in the following fields in the U.S. in 2021:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "2.5",
  "computer science": "12.0",
  "business administration": "25.0"
}
```

These estimates are subject to variation and are based on general trends observed in graduate enrollment data.
