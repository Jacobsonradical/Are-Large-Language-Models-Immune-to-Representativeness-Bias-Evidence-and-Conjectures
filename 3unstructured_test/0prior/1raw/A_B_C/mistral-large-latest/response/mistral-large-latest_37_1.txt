Based on recent trends and data from the Council of Graduate Schools and the National Center for Education Statistics, here are my best estimates for the percentage of graduate students enrolled in the following fields in the U.S. in 2021:

```json
{
  "business administration": 25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 2,
  "computer science": 10
}
```

These estimates are subject to change and may not perfectly reflect the actual enrollment percentages.
