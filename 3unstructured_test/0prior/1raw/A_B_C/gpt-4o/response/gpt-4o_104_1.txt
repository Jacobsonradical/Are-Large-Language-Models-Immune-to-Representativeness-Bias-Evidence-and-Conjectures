Sure, here are my best estimates for the percentage of graduate students enrolled in these specific fields in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "3",
  "computer science": "15",
  "business administration": "23"
}

These are rough estimates based on the distribution of graduate students across various fields, and the actual numbers may vary.
