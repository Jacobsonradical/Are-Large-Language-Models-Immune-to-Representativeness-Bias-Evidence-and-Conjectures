Certainly! Here are my best estimates for the percentages of graduate students enrolled in the given fields in the U.S. in 2021:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 3,
  "business administration": 20,
  "computer science": 10
}
```

Please note that these numbers are approximate and based on general trends and available data. The actual percentages could vary slightly.
