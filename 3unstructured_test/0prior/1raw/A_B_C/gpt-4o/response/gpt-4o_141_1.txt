Sure, here are my best estimates for the percentage of graduate students enrolled in these fields in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 5,
  "business administration": 20,
  "computer science": 10
}

Please note that these are approximate estimates and actual percentages may vary.
