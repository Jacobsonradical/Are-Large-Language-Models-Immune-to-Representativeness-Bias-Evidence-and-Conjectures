Here are some educated guesses for the percentage of graduate students enrolled in those fields in the U.S. in 2021. Keep in mind these are rough estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": "20",
  "business administration": "25",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  This field has seen explosive growth in recent years. While it might not be the absolute majority, it's safe to assume a significant chunk, perhaps around 20%, of graduate students are in computer science-related programs.
* **Business Administration:** MBA programs and other business-related master's degrees remain consistently popular, likely representing the largest single field of study at the graduate level. A guess of 25% seems reasonable.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are essential but attract a smaller percentage of students compared to tech or business.  A guess of 5% reflects the importance of these fields while acknowledging their niche nature. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just educated guesses. Actual data from the National Center for Education Statistics or similar organizations would provide more accurate figures.
* Graduate enrollment trends vary by institution, program prestige, and economic factors.
