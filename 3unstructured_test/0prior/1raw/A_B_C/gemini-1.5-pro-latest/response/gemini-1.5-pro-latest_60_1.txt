**Rationale:**

* **Computer Science:**  The tech industry is booming, leading to high demand and interest in computer science graduate programs. 20% feels like a reasonable estimate considering this popularity.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are important but attract a smaller pool of graduate students compared to areas like computer science or business. 5% seems reasonable. 
* **Business Administration:**  MBA programs and other business-related master's degrees remain consistently popular, making 25% a fair estimation. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses. The actual percentages may vary depending on factors like data collection methods, specific program definitions, and year-to-year fluctuations in enrollment. For precise figures, referring to official data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) or similar sources is recommended.
