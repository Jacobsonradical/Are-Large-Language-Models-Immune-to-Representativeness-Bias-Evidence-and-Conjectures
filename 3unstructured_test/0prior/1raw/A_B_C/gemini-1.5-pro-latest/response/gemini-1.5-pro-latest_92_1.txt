{
  "computer science": "20",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5",
  "business administration": "25"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  Given the high demand for tech skills and the popularity of computer science programs, I estimate around 20% of graduate students were enrolled in this field. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are important but niche, so I estimate a smaller percentage, around 5%.
* **Business Administration:**  MBA programs and other business-related master's degrees remain popular, so I estimate around 25% of graduate students were enrolled in this area.

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses. The actual percentages may vary depending on factors like data source, specific program definitions, and year-to-year fluctuations.
