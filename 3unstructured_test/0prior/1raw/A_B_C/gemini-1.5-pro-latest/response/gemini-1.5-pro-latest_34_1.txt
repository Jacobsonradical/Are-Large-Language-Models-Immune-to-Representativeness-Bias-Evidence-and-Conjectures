```json
{
  "computer science": "20",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5",
  "business administration": "35"
}
``` 

These are rough estimates:

* **Computer Science:**  The popularity of computer science makes it likely a significant portion of graduate students, but likely less than the more general field of Business Administration.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These are more specialized fields, so the percentage is likely much lower. 
* **Business Administration:**  MBA and related programs are consistently popular, suggesting this could be the largest group. 

**Important Note:**  These percentages are highly speculative. Actual data from the U.S. Department of Education or a similar source would be needed for accurate figures.
