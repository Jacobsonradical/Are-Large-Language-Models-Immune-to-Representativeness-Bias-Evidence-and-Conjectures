**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Given the high demand and popularity of tech fields, it's reasonable to assume a significant portion of graduate students are in computer science.  20% feels like a plausible high-end estimate.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are important but attract a smaller pool of graduate students compared to broader fields. 5% seems reasonable.
* **Business Administration:**  MBA programs and other business-related master's degrees are consistently popular, likely representing a substantial portion of graduate enrollment. 35% seems like a reasonable estimate. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses. Actual percentages can vary depending on factors like university specialization and yearly fluctuations in enrollment. To find precise figures, you'd need data from the National Center for Education Statistics or a similar organization.
