Here are my best guesses for the percentage of U.S. graduate students enrolled in each field in 2021. Keep in mind these are rough estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": "35",
  "computer science": "15",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business administration** consistently ranks as one of the most popular graduate degrees, likely attracting a significant portion of students.
* **Computer science** has seen tremendous growth in recent years, but it might not yet match the sheer volume of business programs. 
* **Agricultural and veterinary science** are more specialized fields, likely representing a smaller percentage of total graduate enrollment.
