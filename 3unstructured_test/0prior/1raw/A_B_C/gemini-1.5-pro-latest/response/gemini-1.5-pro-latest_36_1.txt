**Reasoning:**

* **Business administration** consistently ranks highly in graduate program enrollment due to its perceived career prospects and high earning potential. 
* **Agricultural and veterinary science** are more specialized fields, resulting in a significantly smaller proportion of graduate students. 
* **Computer science** has seen a surge in popularity in recent years due to the growing tech industry and high demand for qualified professionals. While not as large as business administration, it likely represents a substantial portion of graduate students. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses. Actual enrollment figures can vary significantly depending on factors like university program offerings, economic conditions, and student preferences. For precise data, it's best to consult official sources like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).
