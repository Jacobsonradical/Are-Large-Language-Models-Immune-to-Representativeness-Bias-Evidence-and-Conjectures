Here are my estimations for the percentage of graduate students enrolled in those fields in the U.S. during 2021. Keep in mind these are educated guesses: 

```json
{
  "business administration": "35",
  "computer science": "15",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business administration** consistently ranks highly among the most popular graduate degrees due to its broad application in various industries and potential for high earning potential. 
* **Computer science** has seen significant growth in recent years due to the increasing demand for tech professionals.  
* **Agricultural and veterinary science** are more specialized fields, leading to a smaller percentage of total graduate student enrollment. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just estimates. The actual percentages can vary depending on the source and how "graduate program" is defined (e.g., including only master's and doctoral programs, or also professional degrees).
* To obtain more precise data, you would need to refer to official statistics from institutions like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States.
