**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Given the high demand for tech professionals, it's safe to assume a significant portion of graduate students are in computer science. 20% seems like a reasonable estimate. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are important but attract a smaller student population compared to broader fields. 5% seems appropriate.
* **Business Administration:** Business schools are consistently popular, with MBA programs attracting a large number of students. 25% reflects this popularity.

**Important Note:** These are rough estimates. The actual percentages may vary based on factors like university specialization, economic trends, and data collection methods.
