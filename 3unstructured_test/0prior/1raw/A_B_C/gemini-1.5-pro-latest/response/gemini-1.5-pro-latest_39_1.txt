**Reasoning:**

These percentages are rough estimates based on general trends in graduate education:

* **Computer Science:**  This field has seen significant growth in recent years due to high demand. 20% is a reasonable estimate considering its popularity.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are important but represent a smaller portion of graduate enrollment compared to others. 5% reflects this.
* **Business Administration:** MBA programs and other business-related degrees are consistently popular choices, likely encompassing a significant portion of graduate students, hence an estimate of 25%. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses. Actual data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) or similar organizations would be needed for accurate figures.
