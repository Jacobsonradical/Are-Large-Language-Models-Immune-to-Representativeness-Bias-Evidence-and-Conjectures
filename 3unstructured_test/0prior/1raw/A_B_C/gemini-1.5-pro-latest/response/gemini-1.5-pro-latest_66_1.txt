**Reasoning:**

These percentages are rough estimates based on general trends in graduate education:

* **Computer Science:**  Computer science is a highly popular and growing field, but it doesn't encompass the majority of graduate students. 20% seems like a reasonable estimate considering its popularity while acknowledging other large fields.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are important but represent a smaller portion of overall graduate enrollment. 5% reflects the niche nature of these programs. 
* **Business Administration:** Business schools, particularly MBA programs, attract a significant number of graduate students.  25% is a plausible estimate, though it could fluctuate depending on the year and economic factors. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses.  Accurate data on graduate enrollment by field would come from sources like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States.
