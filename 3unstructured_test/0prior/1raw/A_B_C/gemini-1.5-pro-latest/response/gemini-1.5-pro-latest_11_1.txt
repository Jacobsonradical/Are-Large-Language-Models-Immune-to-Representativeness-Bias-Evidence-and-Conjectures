Here's an educated guess at the percentage breakdown of graduate students in the US for 2021:

```json
{
  "computer science": "20",
  "business administration": "30",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5"
}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Business Administration** consistently holds a large portion of graduate enrollment due to the popularity of MBA programs and related fields. 
* **Computer Science** has seen significant growth in recent years, reflecting the high demand for tech professionals. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** fields, while essential,  generally attract a smaller percentage of the overall graduate student population.

**Important Note:** These are just estimates.  Actual figures can vary depending on data sources and how fields are categorized.  For more accurate data, you'd want to consult sources like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States.
