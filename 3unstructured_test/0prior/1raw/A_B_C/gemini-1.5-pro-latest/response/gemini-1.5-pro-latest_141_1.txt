**Rationale:**

* **Computer science** is a highly popular field, but it's likely outpaced by business administration in overall graduate enrollment. 
* **Agricultural and veterinary science**, while important, likely represent a smaller proportion of total graduate students. 
* **Business administration** (including MBAs) tends to have very high enrollment in the US.

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses. Actual percentages may vary significantly depending on factors like data sources, specific program definitions, and year-to-year fluctuations.
