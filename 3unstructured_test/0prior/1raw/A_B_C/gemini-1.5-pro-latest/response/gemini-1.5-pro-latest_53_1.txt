  "business administration": "25"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** This field has seen explosive growth in recent years, attracting a large portion of graduate students. 20% seems like a reasonable estimate.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  These fields are important but attract a smaller percentage of the overall graduate student population.  5% seems plausible.
* **Business Administration:**  MBA programs and other business-related master's degrees remain consistently popular, likely representing a significant portion of graduate students. 25% feels like a fair estimate.

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses. Actual percentages may vary depending on data sources and definitions of these fields.  To get more accurate numbers, you would need to consult official statistics from organizations like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States.
