Here's an educated guess on the percentage of graduate students enrolled in those fields in 2021. Keep in mind these are rough estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": "20",
  "business administration": "35",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration** consistently attracts a large portion of graduate students, likely exceeding other fields. 
* **Computer Science** has seen significant growth in recent years, making a 20% estimate reasonable.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**, while important, usually enroll a smaller percentage of graduate students compared to the other two. 

**Important Note:**  Actual percentages could vary significantly depending on factors like specific program popularity, data collection methods, and inclusion/exclusion of professional degrees. For precise figures, referring to official data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the US would be essential.
