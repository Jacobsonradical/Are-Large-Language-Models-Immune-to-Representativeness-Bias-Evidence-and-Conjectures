**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The tech industry is booming, leading to high demand and popularity for computer science graduate programs. 20% feels like a reasonable estimate, though it could be even higher in reality.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are important but attract a smaller percentage of graduate students compared to broader fields. 5% seems like a plausible estimate.
* **Business Administration:**  MBA programs and other business-related master's degrees remain consistently popular, making 35% a reasonable guess. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses. Actual percentages might vary based on factors like data sources, specific program definitions, and year-to-year fluctuations.
