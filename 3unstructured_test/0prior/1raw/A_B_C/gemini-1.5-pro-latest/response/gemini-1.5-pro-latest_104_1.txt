Here are some educated guesses for the percentage of graduate students enrolled in those fields in the US during 2021. Keep in mind these are rough estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": "35",
  "computer science": "15",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business administration** consistently attracts a large portion of graduate students due to the popularity of MBAs and other related degrees. 
* **Computer science** has been growing in popularity, but likely doesn't yet match business administration in total enrollment.
* **Agricultural and veterinary science** are more specialized fields, leading to a smaller percentage of the overall graduate student population. 

**Important Note:** These numbers can fluctuate based on various factors, and more accurate data would come from official sources like the National Center for Education Statistics.
