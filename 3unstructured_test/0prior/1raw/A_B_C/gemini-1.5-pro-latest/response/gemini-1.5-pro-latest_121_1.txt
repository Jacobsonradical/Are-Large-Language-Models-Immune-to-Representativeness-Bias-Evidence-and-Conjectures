**Reasoning:**

* **Business administration** consistently attracts a large percentage of graduate students due to its career prospects. A figure around 35% reflects this popularity.
* **Agricultural and veterinary science**, while important, are more specialized fields and likely attract a smaller percentage of graduate students. 5% seems like a reasonable estimate.
* **Computer science** has seen a surge in popularity in recent years, leading to a significant portion of graduate students pursuing this field. A figure around 20% seems plausible. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses.  Actual percentages could vary depending on factors like specific program popularity, data collection methods, and the definition of each field.
