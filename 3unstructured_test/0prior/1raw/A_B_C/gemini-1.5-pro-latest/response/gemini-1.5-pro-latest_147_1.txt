Here are my estimated percentages for graduate student enrollment in the U.S. during 2021:

```json
{
  "business administration": "35",
  "computer science": "15",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** MBA programs are consistently popular, likely making up a significant portion of graduate students.
* **Computer Science:** The growing tech industry drives high enrollment in computer science, but it's unlikely to surpass the sheer volume of business programs.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are vital but specialized, resulting in a smaller percentage of total graduate students. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses. Actual data from the National Center for Education Statistics or a similar organization would provide more accurate figures.
