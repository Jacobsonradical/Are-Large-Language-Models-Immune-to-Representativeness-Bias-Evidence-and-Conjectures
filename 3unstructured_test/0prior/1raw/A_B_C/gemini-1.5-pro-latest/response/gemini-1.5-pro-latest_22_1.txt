**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** This field has seen tremendous growth in recent years with high demand, leading to a significant portion of graduate students pursuing it. 20% seems like a reasonable estimate.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields, while important, attract a smaller pool of graduate students compared to fields like computer science or business. 5% feels appropriate.
* **Business Administration:** Business schools, particularly MBA programs, consistently attract a large number of graduate students. 35% accounts for the popularity of this field. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses. Actual percentages might vary based on factors like specific program popularity, data collection methodologies, and year-to-year fluctuations. For precise data, referring to official reports from organizations like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is recommended.
