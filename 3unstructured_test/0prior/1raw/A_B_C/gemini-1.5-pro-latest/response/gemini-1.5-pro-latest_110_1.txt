Here are some educated guesses for the percentage of U.S. graduate students enrolled in each field in 2021. Keep in mind these are rough estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": "35",
  "computer science": "15",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business administration** consistently attracts a large share of graduate students due to its career prospects. 
* **Computer science** has been rapidly growing in popularity, making a significant portion of graduate enrollment likely.
* **Agricultural and veterinary science** fields are more specialized, resulting in a smaller percentage compared to broader fields like business or computer science.
