**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Given the high demand for tech professionals, it's reasonable to estimate a significant portion of graduate students are in this field. 20% seems like a plausible estimate. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are important but attract a smaller number of graduate students compared to fields like computer science or business. 5% appears to be a reasonable estimate.
* **Business Administration:**  MBA programs and other business-related graduate degrees remain popular, likely representing a substantial portion of enrolled students. 35% seems like a reasonable estimate.

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses. The actual percentages can vary significantly depending on factors such as the specific universities considered, data collection methods, and the definition of each field of study. To obtain accurate data, it is best to consult official sources like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).
