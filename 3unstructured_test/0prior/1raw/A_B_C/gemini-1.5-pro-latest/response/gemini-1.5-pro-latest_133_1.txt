  "business administration": "25"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  Given the high demand for tech professionals, it's reasonable to assume a significant portion of graduate students are in this field. 20% feels like a safe estimate.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are important but attract a smaller percentage of graduate students compared to broader fields. 5% seems reasonable.
* **Business Administration:** MBA programs and other business-related degrees remain popular, likely representing a substantial portion of graduate enrollment. 25% seems plausible. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses.  Actual percentages can vary significantly based on factors like university specialization, data collection methods, and evolving student trends.  To get precise figures, you'd need to consult official statistics from the US Department of Education or similar sources.
