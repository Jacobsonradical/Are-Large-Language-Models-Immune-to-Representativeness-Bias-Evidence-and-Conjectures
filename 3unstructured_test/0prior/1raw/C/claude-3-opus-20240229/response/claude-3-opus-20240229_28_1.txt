Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "8"
}

Please note that this is an educated guess based on general knowledge and trends, but not on specific data for 2021 graduate student enrollment. The actual percentage may vary.
