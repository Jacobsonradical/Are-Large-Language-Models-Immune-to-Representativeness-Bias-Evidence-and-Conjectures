Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "9"
}

Please note that this is an educated guess based on general knowledge and trends, but I don't have precise enrollment data for 2021. The actual percentage may vary somewhat from this estimate.
