Here's my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "8"
}

This is an educated guess based on general knowledge about the popularity of various graduate programs. Computer science is a popular and growing field, but still likely represents a relatively small percentage of total graduate student enrollment across all disciplines.
