Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "8"
}

This is a rough estimate based on general knowledge. The actual percentage may vary. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, about 5% of graduate students were enrolled in computer and information sciences programs in recent years, but the percentage has likely grown.
