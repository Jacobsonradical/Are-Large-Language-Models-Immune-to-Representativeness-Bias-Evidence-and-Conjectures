Here is my attempt at estimating the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "8"
}

This is a rough estimate based on limited data. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, about 9.3% of all master's degrees and 6.6% of all doctoral degrees awarded in the U.S. in 2019-2020 were in computer and information sciences. So overall, I'd guess around 8% of graduate students were likely enrolled in computer science programs in 2021, but the actual percentage could vary somewhat from this estimate.
