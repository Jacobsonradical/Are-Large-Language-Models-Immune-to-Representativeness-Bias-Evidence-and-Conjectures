Based on the information available to me, here is my best guess for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "10"
}

Please note that this is an estimate and the actual percentage may vary. Computer science is a popular field, but there are many other graduate programs available across various disciplines.
