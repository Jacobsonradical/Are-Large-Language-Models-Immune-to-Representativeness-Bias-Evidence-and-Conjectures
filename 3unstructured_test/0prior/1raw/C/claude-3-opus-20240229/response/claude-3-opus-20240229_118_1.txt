Here is my attempt at estimating the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "8"
}

This is my best guess based on general knowledge. Computer science is a popular graduate field, but still makes up a relatively small percentage of total graduate students across all fields. Please note this is only a rough estimate, as I don't have definitive data on 2021 graduate enrollment by field.
