Here is my best estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "10"
}

Please note that this is an approximation based on my general knowledge, and the actual percentage may vary. The field of computer science has grown in popularity in recent years, but it is still one among many graduate programs available in the United States.
