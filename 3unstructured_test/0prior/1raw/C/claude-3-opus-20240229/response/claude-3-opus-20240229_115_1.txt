Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "10"
}

This is a rough estimate based on limited data. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, about 9.3% of master's degrees and 7.8% of doctoral degrees awarded in the U.S. in 2019-2020 were in computer and information sciences. So a reasonable guess is that around 10% of graduate students overall were studying computer science in 2021. However, the actual percentage could vary from this.
