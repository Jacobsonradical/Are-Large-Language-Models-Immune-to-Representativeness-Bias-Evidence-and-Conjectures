Here is my attempt at answering the question, based on my general knowledge:

{
  "computer science": "12"
}

Computer science has become an increasingly popular graduate field in recent years in the U.S., with strong job prospects and growing demand. However, it still likely makes up a relatively small percentage of total graduate students compared to larger, more established fields like business, education, health, engineering, social sciences, and humanities. Without looking up exact enrollment statistics, I'd estimate roughly 12% of U.S. graduate students in 2021 were studying computer science. But this is just my best guess based on general knowledge and trends.
