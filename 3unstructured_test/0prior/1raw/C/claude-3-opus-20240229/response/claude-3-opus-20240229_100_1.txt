Here is my attempt to estimate the percentage of U.S. graduate students in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "10"
}

This is my best guess based on general knowledge, but please note that I do not have definitive data on the exact percentage breakdown of graduate students by field of study in 2021. The actual percentage could vary from this estimate.
