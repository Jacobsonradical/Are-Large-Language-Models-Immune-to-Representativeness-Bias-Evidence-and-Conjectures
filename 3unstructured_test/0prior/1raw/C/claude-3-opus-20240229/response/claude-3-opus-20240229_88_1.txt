Here is my attempt at estimating the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "8"
}

This is my best guess based on general knowledge, but please note that I do not have definitive data on the exact enrollment percentages. Computer science is a popular graduate field, but still likely represents a relatively small slice of the overall graduate student population across all disciplines.
