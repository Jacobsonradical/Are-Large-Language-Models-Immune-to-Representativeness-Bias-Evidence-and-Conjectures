Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "9"
}

Please note that this is an educated guess based on general knowledge and trends, and the actual percentage may vary. Computer science has been a popular and growing field in recent years, but it is one of many graduate programs available.
