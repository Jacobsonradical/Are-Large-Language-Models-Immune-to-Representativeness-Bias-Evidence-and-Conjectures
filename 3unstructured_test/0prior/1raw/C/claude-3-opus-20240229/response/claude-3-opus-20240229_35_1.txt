Here is my best guess for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "15"
}

Please note that this is an estimate based on my general knowledge and understanding of the popularity of computer science as a graduate field of study in recent years in the United States. The actual percentage may vary from this estimate.
