Here is my best estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "10"
}

Please note that this is an educated guess based on my general knowledge, and the actual percentage may vary. Precise enrollment data would need to be obtained from reliable sources for a more accurate figure.
