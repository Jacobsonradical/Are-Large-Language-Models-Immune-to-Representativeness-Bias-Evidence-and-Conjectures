Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "8"
}

Please note that this is just an educated guess based on general knowledge, and the actual percentage may vary. To get a more accurate answer, it would be best to consult official enrollment statistics from the U.S. Department of Education or other reliable sources.
