Here is my attempt to estimate the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "10"
}

This is a rough estimate based on limited knowledge. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, about 9.3% of all master's degrees and 7.9% of all doctoral degrees awarded in the U.S. in the 2019-2020 academic year were in the field of computer and information sciences. So a figure around 10% for computer science graduate enrollment in 2021 seems plausible, but it is only an educated guess in the absence of definitive 2021 enrollment data. The actual percentage could be somewhat higher or lower.
