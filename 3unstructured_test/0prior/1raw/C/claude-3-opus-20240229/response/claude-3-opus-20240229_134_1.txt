Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "10"
}

Please note that this is my best guess based on general knowledge, and the actual percentage may vary. The field of computer science has been growing in recent years, but it is still a relatively specialized field compared to some other graduate programs.
