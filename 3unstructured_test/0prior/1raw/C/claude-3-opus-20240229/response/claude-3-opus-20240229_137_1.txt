Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "10"
}

This is a rough guess based on my general knowledge. Computer science is a popular graduate field, but there are many other fields of graduate study. Without looking up the exact statistics, I would estimate that around 10% of U.S. graduate students in 2021 were enrolled in computer science programs.
