Here's my best guess for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. who were enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "10"
}

Please note that this is an estimate based on my general knowledge and understanding of the distribution of graduate students across different fields in the United States. The actual percentage may vary based on the specific data and the definition of the fields considered.
