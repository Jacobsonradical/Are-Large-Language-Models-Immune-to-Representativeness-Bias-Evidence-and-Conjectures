Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "10"
}

This is a rough estimate based on limited data. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, about 9.3% of master's degrees and 7.6% of doctoral degrees awarded in the U.S. in 2019-2020 were in the field of computer and information sciences. The actual percentage enrolled in 2021 could be somewhat higher or lower than my 10% estimate.
