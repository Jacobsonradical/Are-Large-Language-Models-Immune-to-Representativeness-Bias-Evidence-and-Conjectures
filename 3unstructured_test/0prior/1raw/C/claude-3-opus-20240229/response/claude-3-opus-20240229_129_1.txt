Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "10"
}

This is my best guess based on general knowledge, but please note that I don't have definitive data on 2021 graduate student enrollment by field. The actual percentage could vary from this estimate.
