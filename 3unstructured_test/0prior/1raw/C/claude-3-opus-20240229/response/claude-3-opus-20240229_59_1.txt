Here is my best estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in computer science:

{
  "computer science": "10"
}

Note that this is a rough approximation based on available data and trends, as I don't have precise enrollment figures for 2021. Computer science has been a popular and growing field for graduate study in recent years.
