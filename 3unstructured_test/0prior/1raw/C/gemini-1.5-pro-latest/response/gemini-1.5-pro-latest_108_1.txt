{
  "computer science": "20" 
} 

**Explanation:**

It's difficult to pinpoint an exact percentage without access to comprehensive data. However, here's why I estimate around 20%:

* **STEM Popularity:** The U.S. has seen a surge in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) field enrollment. Computer science, being a core STEM area, benefits from this trend.
* **Job Market Demand:** The high demand for computer science graduates in the job market likely attracts a significant portion of students.
* **International Students:** The U.S. attracts many international students, and computer science programs are often popular choices.

**Important Note:** This is an educated guess. The actual percentage could be higher or lower depending on factors like university data, specific program popularity, and enrollment trends.
