  "computer science": "20"
} 

While it's difficult to pinpoint an exact percentage without access to specific data, a reasonable estimate for the percentage of graduate students enrolled in computer science in the U.S. in 2021 is around 20%. 

Here's why:

* **High Demand:** Computer science is a highly sought-after field with significant job growth, likely attracting a substantial number of graduate students. 
* **Broad Field:**  Computer science encompasses various specializations, from artificial intelligence to cybersecurity, potentially attracting students with diverse interests.
* **Competition:**  The popularity of computer science means it's likely a competitive field for graduate admissions, potentially limiting overall enrollment numbers compared to some other disciplines.

**Important Note:** This is an educated guess. The actual percentage could be higher or lower depending on various factors and data sources.
