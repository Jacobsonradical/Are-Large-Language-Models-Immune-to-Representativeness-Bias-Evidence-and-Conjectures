It's difficult to be precise without access to specific data. However, computer science is a very popular field for graduate studies in the US.  A guess of 20% seems reasonable, considering:

* **High demand:** The tech industry is booming, driving demand for computer science graduates.
* **STEM popularity:** STEM fields, in general, attract a large portion of graduate students.

**Important Note:** This is just an educated guess. The actual percentage could be higher or lower.  To get a more accurate answer, you would need to consult official statistics from organizations like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).
