Here is my best estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "18"
}

Please note that this is an educated guess based on general knowledge, and the actual percentage may vary. The field of business administration is known to be a popular choice among graduate students in the United States, but there are many other fields of study as well.
