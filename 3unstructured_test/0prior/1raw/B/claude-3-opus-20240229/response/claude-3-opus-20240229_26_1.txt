Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "25"
}

This is my best guess based on general knowledge about popular graduate fields of study. Business administration is one of the most common graduate degrees, but there are also many students pursuing advanced degrees in other fields like education, healthcare, engineering, social sciences, and humanities. Without looking up the exact statistics, I'd estimate roughly 25% of U.S. graduate students in 2021 were enrolled in business administration programs.
