Here is my best estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "25"
}

Please note that this is an educated guess based on general knowledge, as I don't have access to precise enrollment statistics for 2021. The actual percentage could vary somewhat from this estimate.
