Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "25"
}

Please note that this is an educated guess based on my general knowledge. The actual percentage may vary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it is best to consult official statistics from reliable sources such as the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).
