Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "25"
}

According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, around 24% of master's degrees conferred in the U.S. in 2019-2020 were in the field of business. Assuming this percentage remained relatively stable, I estimate that approximately 25% of graduate students in 2021 were likely enrolled in business administration programs.
