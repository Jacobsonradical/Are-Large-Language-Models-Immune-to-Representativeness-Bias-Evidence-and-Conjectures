Here is my best guess for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "20"
}

Please note that this is an estimate based on my general knowledge and understanding of graduate program enrollment trends in the United States. The actual percentage may vary.
