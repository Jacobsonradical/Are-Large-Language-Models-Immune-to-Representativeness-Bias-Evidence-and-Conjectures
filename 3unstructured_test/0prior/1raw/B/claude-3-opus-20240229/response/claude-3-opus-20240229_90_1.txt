Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "18"
}

This is my best guess based on general knowledge. Business administration is a popular graduate field, but there are many other common graduate programs like law, medicine, engineering, education, etc. So while a significant percentage likely study business, it's probably under 20% of the total graduate student population.
