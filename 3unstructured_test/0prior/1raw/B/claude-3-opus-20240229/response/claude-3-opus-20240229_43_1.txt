Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "25"
}

Please note that this is an educated guess based on general knowledge, and the actual percentage may vary. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), around 20% of master's degrees conferred in the U.S. in recent years have been in the field of business, which includes business administration and related programs.
