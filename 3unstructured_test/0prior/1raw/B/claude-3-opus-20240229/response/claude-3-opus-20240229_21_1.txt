Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "25"
}

This is a rough estimate based on general knowledge that business administration is one of the most popular graduate degree programs in the U.S. However, I don't have precise data on the exact percentage enrolled in this field in 2021.
