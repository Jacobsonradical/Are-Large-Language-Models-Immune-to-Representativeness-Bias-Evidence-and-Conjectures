Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "25"
}

This is a rough estimate based on general knowledge that business administration is a relatively popular graduate degree field in the U.S., but without having specific enrollment data on hand to reference. The actual percentage could vary considerably from this guess.
