Here's my attempt at answering the question, based on my general knowledge:

{
  "business administration": "25"
}

Please keep in mind that this is an educated guess and the actual percentage may vary. Business administration is a popular field for graduate studies in the U.S., but there are many other fields that also attract a significant number of students.
