Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "20"
}

Please note that this is an educated guess based on my general knowledge, and the actual percentage may vary. Business administration is a popular graduate degree, but there are many other fields of study at the graduate level as well.
