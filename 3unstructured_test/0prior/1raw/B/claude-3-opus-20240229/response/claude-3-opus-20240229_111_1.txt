Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "20"
}

This is a rough estimate based on my general knowledge. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, around 20% of master's degrees conferred in the U.S. in recent years have been in the field of business, which includes business administration and management. However, the exact percentage for graduate students enrolled in 2021 may vary somewhat from this figure.
