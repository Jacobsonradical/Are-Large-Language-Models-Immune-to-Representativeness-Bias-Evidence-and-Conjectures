Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "20"
}

This is my best guess based on general knowledge about the popularity of business administration programs at the graduate level in the United States. However, I don't have specific data for 2021 enrollment, so this is just an estimate.
