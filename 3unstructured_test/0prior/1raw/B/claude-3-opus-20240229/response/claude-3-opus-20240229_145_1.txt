Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "25"
}

Based on data I've seen, business is one of the most popular graduate fields of study in the U.S., accounting for a significant portion of master's degrees awarded. However, without researching the exact enrollment figures for 2021, I can only provide a rough estimate that about 25% of graduate students were likely studying business administration or a closely related business field.
