  "business administration": "18"
} 

**Explanation:**

While I don't have access to real-time data on 2021 graduate enrollment, business administration consistently ranks as a popular field of study. My estimate of 18% is based on historical trends and the fact that business degrees often attract a significant portion of graduate students. 

**Important Note:** This is a rough estimate.  To get a more accurate percentage, you would need to consult official data sources like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States.
