  "business administration": "20"
}
 
**Explanation:**

While I don't have access to specific enrollment data, a reasonable estimate for business administration in US graduate programs is around 20%. Here's why:

* **Popularity:** Business administration, including MBAs and specialized masters programs, is consistently a popular field of study at the graduate level. 
* **Other Fields:** Many other disciplines also attract significant graduate student populations (e.g., education, engineering, health professions, law).

**Important Note:** This is a very rough estimate. The actual percentage can vary based on:

* **Data Source:** Different organizations might use different classification systems for fields of study.
* **Year:** Enrollment trends change over time.
* **Level:** Master's vs. doctoral programs could have different distributions.

To get more precise information, you would need data from sources like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) or specific university enrollment reports.
