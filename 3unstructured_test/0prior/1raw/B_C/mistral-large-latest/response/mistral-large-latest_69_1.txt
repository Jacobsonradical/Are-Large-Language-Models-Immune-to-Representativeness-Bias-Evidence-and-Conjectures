Based on recent trends and data from the Council of Graduate Schools and other educational reports, here are my best guesses for the percentage of graduate students enrolled in these fields in the U.S. in 2021:

```json
{
  "business administration": "23",
  "computer science": "12"
}
```

These estimates are subject to change and may not perfectly reflect the actual percentages. They are based on historical data and trends in graduate enrollment.
