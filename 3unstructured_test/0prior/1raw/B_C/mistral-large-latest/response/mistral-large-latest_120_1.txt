Based on recent trends and data from the Council of Graduate Schools and other educational reports, here are my best estimates for the percentages of graduate students enrolled in these fields in the U.S. in 2021:

```json
{
  "business administration": 25,
  "computer science": 15
}
```

These estimates are subject to variation and should be taken as approximate figures.
