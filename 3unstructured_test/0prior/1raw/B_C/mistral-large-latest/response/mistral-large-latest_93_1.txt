Based on recent trends and data from the Council of Graduate Schools and other educational reports, here are my best estimates for the percentage of graduate students enrolled in the following fields in the U.S. in 2021:

```json
{
  "business administration": 25,
  "computer science": 15
}
```

These estimates are subject to variation and should be considered approximate values.
