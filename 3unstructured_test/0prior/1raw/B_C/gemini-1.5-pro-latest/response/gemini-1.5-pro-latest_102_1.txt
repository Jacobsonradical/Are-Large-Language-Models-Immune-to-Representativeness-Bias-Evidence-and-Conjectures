  "computer science": "20",
  "business administration": "35"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration** is consistently one of the most popular fields for graduate studies. A percentage around 35% seems plausible, though it could vary depending on the specific data source.
* **Computer Science** has seen tremendous growth in recent years. While it might not yet reach the sheer volume of Business Administration, a figure around 20% feels reasonable given the field's popularity and demand.

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses.  Accurate percentages would require consulting official data from the US Department of Education or a similar source.
