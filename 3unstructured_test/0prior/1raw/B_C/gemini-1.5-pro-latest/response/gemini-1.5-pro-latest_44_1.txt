{
  "computer science": "15",
  "business administration": "25"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration** has consistently been a top choice for graduate studies.  A figure around 25% seems reasonable considering its popularity.
* **Computer Science** is a rapidly growing field with high demand. While it's attracting a significant number of students, it's likely not as large as more established fields like Business Administration, hence an estimate around 15%. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses. Actual percentages may vary depending on data sources and definitions of "graduate program."  To get accurate figures, you would need to consult official sources like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).
