**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** are relatively specialized fields, likely representing a smaller portion of overall graduate enrollment. 
* **Computer science** is a very popular field, especially at the graduate level, but it likely doesn't encompass the majority of graduate students. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses. Actual percentages would require access to enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics or similar sources.
