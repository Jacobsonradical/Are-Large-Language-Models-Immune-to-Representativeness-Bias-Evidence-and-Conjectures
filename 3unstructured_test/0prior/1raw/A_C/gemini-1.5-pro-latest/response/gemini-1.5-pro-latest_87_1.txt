**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  Computer science is a very popular field, and graduate programs in the U.S. are seeing high enrollment. 20% feels like a reasonable estimate considering its popularity and the demand for tech professionals.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** While essential, these fields tend to have smaller graduate programs compared to fields like computer science or business. 5% seems reasonable considering this. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses.  To get accurate percentages, you would need data from the National Center for Education Statistics or a similar organization that tracks graduate enrollment.
