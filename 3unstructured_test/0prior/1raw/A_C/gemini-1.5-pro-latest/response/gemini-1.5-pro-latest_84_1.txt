**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** This field has seen explosive growth in recent years, making it a popular choice for graduate studies.  20% feels like a reasonable estimate, considering it's likely one of the largest graduate programs but not overwhelmingly dominant. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  While essential, these fields are more specialized and may not attract as many graduate students as broader disciplines. 5% seems reasonable considering this specialization. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses.  Accurate data would come from official sources like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States.
