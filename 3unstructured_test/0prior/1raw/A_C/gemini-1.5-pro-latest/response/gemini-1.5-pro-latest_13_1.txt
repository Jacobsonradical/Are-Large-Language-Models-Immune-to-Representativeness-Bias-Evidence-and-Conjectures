**Reasoning:**

* **Computer science** has seen explosive growth in recent years, making it a very popular field at the graduate level. 20% feels like a reasonable estimate, considering it's likely one of the largest, if not the largest, graduate programs. 
* **Agricultural and veterinary science**, while important, are comparatively niche fields.  3% seems reasonable given the smaller number of universities specializing in these areas and the more focused career paths they often lead to. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses. Actual percentages can vary depending on data sources and how fields are categorized.
