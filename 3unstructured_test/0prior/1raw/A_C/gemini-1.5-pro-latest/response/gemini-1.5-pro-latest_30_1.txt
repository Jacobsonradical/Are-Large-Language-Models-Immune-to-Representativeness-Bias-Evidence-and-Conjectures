**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** This field has seen explosive growth in recent years, making it a popular choice for graduate studies. 20% feels like a reasonable estimate, considering other STEM fields and humanities will also attract a significant portion of graduate students.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are important but relatively niche compared to areas like computer science or business. 3% seems like a reasonable estimate, reflecting the smaller but still significant number of students pursuing these specializations. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses. Actual percentages may vary depending on data sources and definitions of these fields.
