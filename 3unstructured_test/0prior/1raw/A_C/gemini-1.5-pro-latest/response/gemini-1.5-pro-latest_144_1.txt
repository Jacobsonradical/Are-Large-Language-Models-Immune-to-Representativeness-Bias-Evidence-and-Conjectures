**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** are relatively specialized fields, likely representing a smaller portion of overall graduate enrollment. 
* **Computer science** is a highly popular field, especially at the graduate level, but likely not exceeding other large fields like business or engineering combined. 
 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses. Actual percentages would require access to enrollment data from the U.S. Department of Education or similar sources.
