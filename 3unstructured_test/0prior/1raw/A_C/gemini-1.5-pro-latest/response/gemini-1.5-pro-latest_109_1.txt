**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Computer science is a highly popular field, especially at the graduate level.  A significant portion of graduate students are likely enrolled in this area, hence an estimate around 20%. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  While essential, these fields are less broadly popular than computer science.  An estimate around 3% reflects that smaller proportion.

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses. The actual percentages can vary based on data sources and definitions of these fields.
