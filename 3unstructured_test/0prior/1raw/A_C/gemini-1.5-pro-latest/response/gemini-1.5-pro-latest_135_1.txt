**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** Graduate programs in computer science are incredibly popular due to high demand and earning potential in the tech industry. A guess of 20% seems reasonable, considering it's a large field but there are many other graduate disciplines.

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are more specialized compared to computer science.  While essential, they likely attract a smaller percentage of the overall graduate student population. A guess of 3% reflects this specialization. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses.  Actual percentages would require access to enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics or a similar organization.
