  "computer science": "20",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5" 
} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  Computer science is a very popular field, but it's unlikely to be a majority of graduate students.  I'm estimating around 20% to account for its popularity while acknowledging other significant fields like business, engineering, law, etc. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are important but niche compared to broader areas. 5% seems like a reasonable estimate. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses.  Actual percentages would require looking at enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics or similar sources.
