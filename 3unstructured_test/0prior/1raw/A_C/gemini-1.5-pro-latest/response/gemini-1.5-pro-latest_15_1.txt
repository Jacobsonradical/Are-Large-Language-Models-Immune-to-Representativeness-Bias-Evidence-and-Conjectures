**Reasoning:**

These are rough estimates based on general trends in graduate education:

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields, while essential, tend to have a smaller proportion of graduate students compared to areas like business, law, or health. 
* **Computer Science:**  Computer science is a highly popular field, particularly at the graduate level, due to high job demand and earning potential. However, it likely doesn't represent a majority of graduate students.

**Important Note:** These numbers are purely speculative.  To get accurate data, you would need to consult official sources like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States.
