Based on recent trends and data from various educational reports, here are my best guesses for the percentage of graduate students enrolled in these fields in the U.S. in 2021:

```json
{
  "computer science": 15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 2
}
```

These estimates are based on the growing popularity of computer science and the relatively smaller but steady interest in agricultural and veterinary science fields.
