Based on recent trends and data from various educational reports, here are my best guesses for the percentage of graduate students enrolled in these fields in the U.S. in 2021:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "2.5",
  "computer science": "12.0"
}
```

These estimates are based on the following considerations:
- Agricultural and veterinary science programs typically have a smaller enrollment compared to other fields.
- Computer science has seen significant growth in recent years due to the increasing demand for tech professionals.
