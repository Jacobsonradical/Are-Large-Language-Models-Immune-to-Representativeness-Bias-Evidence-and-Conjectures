Here is my best estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "2"
}

Please note that this is an educated guess based on my general knowledge, as I don't have access to precise enrollment data for 2021. The actual percentage may vary.
