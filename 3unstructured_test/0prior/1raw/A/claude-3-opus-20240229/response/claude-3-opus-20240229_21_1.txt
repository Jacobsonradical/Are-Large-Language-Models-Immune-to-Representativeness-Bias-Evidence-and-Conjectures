Here is my estimate for the percentage of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021 who were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "2"
}

This is an educated guess based on general knowledge about the relative popularity of different graduate fields of study. Agricultural and veterinary science likely makes up a relatively small percentage of total graduate student enrollment compared to larger fields like business, education, health, engineering, etc. However, I do not have specific data to confirm the exact percentage with high confidence.
