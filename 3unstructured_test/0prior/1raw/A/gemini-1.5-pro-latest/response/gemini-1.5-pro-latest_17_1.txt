{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5"
} 
 
This is a guess, and the actual percentage could be higher or lower. Here's why I chose this estimate:

* **STEM Field:** Agriculture and veterinary science are specialized fields within STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). STEM fields are popular, but within that, there's a lot of diversity.
* **Professional Focus:**  These fields often lead to specific career paths (veterinarian, agricultural researcher, etc.). Graduate programs in other areas (like business or law) tend to draw larger numbers of students.

To get a more accurate answer, you would need to consult data from sources like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States.
