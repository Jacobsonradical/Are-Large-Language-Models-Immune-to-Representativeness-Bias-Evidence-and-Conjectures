{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I don't have access to specific enrollment data, here's why I estimate around 5%:

* **Graduate programs are specialized:**  Graduate studies tend to focus on specific fields. 
* **STEM fields are popular:** STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields attract a significant portion of graduate students.
* **Agriculture and Veterinary Science are niche:**  While important, these fields are relatively specialized compared to larger fields like engineering, business, or health sciences. 

**Important Note:** This is a very rough estimate. The actual percentage could be higher or lower depending on factors like:

* **Data source:** Different universities and programs have different enrollment patterns.
* **Definition of "agricultural and veterinary science":**  A broader definition that includes related fields (environmental science, food science) would result in a higher percentage.
