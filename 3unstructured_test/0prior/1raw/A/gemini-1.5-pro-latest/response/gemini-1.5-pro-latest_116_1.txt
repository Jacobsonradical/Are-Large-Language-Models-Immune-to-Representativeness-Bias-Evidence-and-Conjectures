**Reasoning:**

While I don't have access to specific enrollment data, I'm estimating based on general trends in higher education:

* **STEM Dominance:**  STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) are very popular in the US, often making up a significant portion of graduate enrollment.
* **Agricultural Specialization:** Agricultural and veterinary science, while important, are more specialized fields. They likely attract a smaller percentage of students compared to broader disciplines within STEM. 

**Therefore, a 5% estimate seems reasonable, suggesting a significant but not overly large proportion of graduate students are in these fields.** 

**Important Note:** This is just an educated guess. Actual figures may vary depending on data sources and definitions of "agricultural and veterinary science." To obtain precise information, you'd need to consult official sources like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).
