  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5"

**Rationale:**

While I don't have access to specific enrollment data, here's why I estimate around 5% of graduate students in the U.S. were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

* **STEM Dominance:** Graduate programs in the U.S. lean heavily towards STEM fields. 
* **Niche Fields:** Agriculture and veterinary science, while important, are relatively specialized compared to fields like engineering, computer science, or business.
* **Combined Estimation:**  Considering the factors above, 5% feels like a reasonable middle-ground estimate. It acknowledges the significance of these fields without overestimating their proportion within the larger graduate student population. 

**Important Note:** This is a rough estimation.  Actual enrollment figures can vary based on numerous factors including university specialization, funding trends, and economic conditions.
