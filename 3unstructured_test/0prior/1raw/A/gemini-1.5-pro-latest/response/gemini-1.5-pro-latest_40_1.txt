  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5" 
}
 

This is just an educated guess. Here's why it's likely a low percentage:

* **Graduate Focus:** Graduate programs skew heavily towards fields like business, law, education, and STEM fields with direct industry applications.
* **Career Paths:**  While agriculture and veterinary science are important, the career paths often don't require the same level of graduate study as some other fields. 

To get a more precise answer, you would need data from the U.S. Department of Education or similar sources that track graduate enrollment by field of study.
