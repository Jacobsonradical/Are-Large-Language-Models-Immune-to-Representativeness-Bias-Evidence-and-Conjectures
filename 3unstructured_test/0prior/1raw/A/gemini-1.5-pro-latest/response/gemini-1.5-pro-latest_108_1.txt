{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I don't have access to specific enrollment data for 2021, I'm basing this estimate on a few factors:

* **Overall Popularity:** Agricultural and veterinary sciences are important fields, but they aren't as broadly popular as fields like business, law, or computer science at the graduate level. 
* **Specialized Programs:** These programs tend to be more specialized, often leading to specific career paths, which could mean a smaller pool of graduate students compared to more general fields.

**Important Note:** 5% is a very rough estimate. The actual percentage could be higher or lower depending on factors like the specific year and available data. To get more accurate information, you would need to consult official sources like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States.
