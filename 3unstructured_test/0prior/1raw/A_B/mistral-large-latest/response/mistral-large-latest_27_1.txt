  "agricultural and veterinary science": "3",
  "business administration": "25"
}

Explanation:
- Agricultural and veterinary science programs typically have a smaller enrollment compared to other fields. Therefore, I estimate that about 3% of graduate students were enrolled in these programs.
- Business administration, including MBA programs, is typically one of the most popular graduate fields. I estimate that about 25% of graduate students were enrolled in business administration programs.
