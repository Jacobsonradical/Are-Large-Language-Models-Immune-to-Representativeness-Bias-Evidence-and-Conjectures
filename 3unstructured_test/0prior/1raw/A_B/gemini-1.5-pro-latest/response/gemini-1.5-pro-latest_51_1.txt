**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** MBA programs are incredibly popular, and business-related fields consistently attract a large portion of graduate students. 35% feels like a reasonable estimate considering this popularity.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are more specialized compared to the broader appeal of business. 5% seems reasonable, acknowledging that there's a consistent need for these professions but not on the same scale as some other disciplines.
