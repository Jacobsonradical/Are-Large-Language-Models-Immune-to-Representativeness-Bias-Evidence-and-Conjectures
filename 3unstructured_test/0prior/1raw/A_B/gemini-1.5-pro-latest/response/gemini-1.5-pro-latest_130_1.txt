**Reasoning:**

* **Business administration** is consistently one of the most popular fields for graduate study in the U.S. A significant portion of graduate students are seeking MBAs or other business-related degrees.  35% is a reasonable estimate considering its popularity.
* **Agricultural and veterinary science** are more specialized fields. While important, they attract a much smaller percentage of the total graduate student population compared to fields like business or law. 5% is a reasonable estimate considering the specialized nature of these fields.
