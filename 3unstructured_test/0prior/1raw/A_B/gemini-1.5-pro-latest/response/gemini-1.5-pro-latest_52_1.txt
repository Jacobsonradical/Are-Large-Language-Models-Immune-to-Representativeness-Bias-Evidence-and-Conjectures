{
  "business administration": "35",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Business administration** is consistently one of the most popular fields for graduate study in the US. I estimate it to be around 35%, reflecting its strong presence.
* **Agricultural and veterinary science** are more specialized fields, likely attracting a smaller percentage of graduate students.  5% seems like a reasonable estimate. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses.  Actual percentages may vary depending on data sources and how fields are categorized.
