**Reasoning:**

* **Business administration** is consistently one of the most popular fields for graduate study in the U.S. A significant portion of graduate students are seeking MBAs or other business-related degrees. 35% feels like a reasonable estimate considering its popularity. 
* **Agricultural and veterinary science** are more specialized fields, likely attracting a smaller percentage of the overall graduate student population. 5% seems like a plausible estimate given their specialized nature. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses. Actual percentages may vary depending on data sources and how specific graduate programs are categorized.
