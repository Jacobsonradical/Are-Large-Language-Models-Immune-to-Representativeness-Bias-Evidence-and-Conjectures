**Reasoning:**

* **Business administration** is consistently one of the most popular fields for graduate study. A figure around 35% seems plausible, though it could vary depending on the specific data source. 
* **Agricultural and veterinary science** are more specialized fields, likely representing a significantly smaller percentage of total graduate enrollment. 5% feels like a reasonable estimate.

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses.  Accurate data would require referencing official statistics from organizations like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States.
