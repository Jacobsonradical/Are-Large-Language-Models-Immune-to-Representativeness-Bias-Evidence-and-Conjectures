**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** MBA programs and other business-related master's degrees are consistently popular, likely encompassing a significant portion of graduate students. 35% feels like a reasonable estimate.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are more specialized, leading to a smaller percentage of overall graduate enrollment. 5% seems reasonable considering the focused nature of these programs.
