**Reasoning:**

* **Business administration** consistently ranks as one of the most popular fields for graduate study in the U.S.  A guess of 35% reflects this popularity while acknowledging other significant fields.
* **Agricultural and veterinary science** are more specialized areas.  A guess of 5% seems reasonable considering these fields, while important, attract a smaller proportion of the overall graduate student population.
