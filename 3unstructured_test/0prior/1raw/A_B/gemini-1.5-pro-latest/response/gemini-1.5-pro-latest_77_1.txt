**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** MBA programs are consistently among the most popular graduate degrees. A significant portion of graduate students, perhaps around 35%, likely fall into this category. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** These fields are more specialized, resulting in a smaller proportion of the overall graduate student population.  5% seems like a reasonable estimate.
