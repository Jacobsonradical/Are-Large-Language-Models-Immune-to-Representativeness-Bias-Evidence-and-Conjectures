**Reasoning:**

* **Business administration** is consistently one of the most popular fields for graduate study in the US, likely comprising a significant portion of graduate students.  35% feels like a reasonable estimate.
* **Agricultural and veterinary science** are important but more specialized fields, likely representing a much smaller percentage of the total graduate student population. 5% seems plausible.
