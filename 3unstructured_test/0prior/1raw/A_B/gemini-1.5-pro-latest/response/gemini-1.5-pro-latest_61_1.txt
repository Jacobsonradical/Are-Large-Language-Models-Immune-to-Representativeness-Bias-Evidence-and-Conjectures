{
  "business administration": "35",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Business administration** consistently ranks among the most popular graduate degrees. A significant portion (around 35%) seems like a reasonable estimate. 
* **Agricultural and veterinary science**, while important, are more specialized fields.  5% seems like a reasonable reflection of this. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses.  Actual percentages would vary based on factors like:

* Specific data sources 
* Definition of "agricultural and veterinary science" (broad vs. narrow)
* Inclusion or exclusion of professional degrees (e.g., MBA, DVM)
