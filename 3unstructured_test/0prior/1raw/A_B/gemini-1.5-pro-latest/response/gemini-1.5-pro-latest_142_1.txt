{
  "business administration": "35",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "5"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Business administration** consistently ranks among the most popular graduate degrees. A significant portion (around 35%) seems like a reasonable estimate.
* **Agricultural and veterinary science** are more specialized fields. While important, they attract a smaller percentage of graduate students (around 5% seems plausible). 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses.  Actual percentages can vary depending on factors like data source and definition of "graduate program." To get precise data, you'd need to consult official sources like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).
