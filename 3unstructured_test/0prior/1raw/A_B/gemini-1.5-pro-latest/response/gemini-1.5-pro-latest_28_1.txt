**Reasoning:**

* **Business administration** is consistently one of the most popular fields for graduate study in the US. I estimate around 35% of graduate students are enrolled in MBA programs or other business-related master's degrees.
* **Agricultural and veterinary science** are important fields, but they attract a smaller percentage of graduate students compared to broader fields like business or education. I estimate around 5% are in these programs. 

**Important Note:** These are educated guesses.  The actual percentages may vary depending on how specific programs are classified and the data source used.  To find more precise data, you'd want to consult sources like the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).
