Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking, empathetic and caring. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem more characteristic of someone in natural sciences than computer science. However, it's certainly possible for a computer science student to have those attributes, so I would estimate a 60% chance the sketch is about Adam if he studied a field other than CS. There's not quite enough specific information to say with high confidence.
