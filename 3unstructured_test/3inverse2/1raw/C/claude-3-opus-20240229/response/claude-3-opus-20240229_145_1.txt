Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, high intelligence and affinity for abstract concepts seem quite compatible with many graduate-level fields of study beyond just computer science. However, the specific mention of enjoying solving puzzles and strong understanding of hard work and dedication also seem potentially well-aligned with the field of computer science. Therefore, I estimate a moderate 60% probability that the sketch could match Adam's personality if he studied a different field, with a 40% chance that computer science is the most likely match given the details provided.
