Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information about Adam being a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoying solving puzzles seem compatible with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants and animals makes me think there is a reasonable chance Adam may have studied something in the life sciences or natural sciences instead. Therefore, I estimate a 0.6 or 60% probability that the personality sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student.
