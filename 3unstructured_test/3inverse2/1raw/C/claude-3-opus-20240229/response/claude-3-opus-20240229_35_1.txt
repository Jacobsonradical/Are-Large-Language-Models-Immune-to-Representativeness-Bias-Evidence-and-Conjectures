Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and Adam's status as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem particularly relevant to computer science. The ability to solve puzzles and grasp abstract concepts is important in computer science.

However, the sketch also mentions a love of animals and plants, as well as empathy, which while great qualities, are less directly relevant to computer science. And of course, without more specific information, it's impossible to say definitively what Adam studied.

Therefore, I estimate a 60% probability that the personality sketch describes a computer science graduate student, based on the limited information provided. But there is still significant uncertainty.
