Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, mathematics, or philosophy. Therefore, if Adam was enrolled in a graduate program other than computer science, I estimate there is only a 30% chance this personality sketch is describing him. The sketch doesn't mention any computer science related interests or skills that would make it more likely to be about a computer science student.
