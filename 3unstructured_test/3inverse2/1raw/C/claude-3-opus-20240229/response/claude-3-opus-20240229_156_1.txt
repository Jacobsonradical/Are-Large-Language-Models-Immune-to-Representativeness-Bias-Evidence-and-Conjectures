Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or animal science rather than computer science. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those interests and qualities to also pursue computer science. Given the limited information, I estimate there is roughly a 30% chance the sketch is referring to Adam if he was actually a computer science graduate student.
