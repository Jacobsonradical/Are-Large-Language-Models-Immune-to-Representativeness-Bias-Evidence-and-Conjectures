Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and Adam's graduate student status in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving ability, high intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts seem compatible with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants and animals leads me to believe there is a reasonable chance Adam may have studied something else related to the life sciences or natural world. So I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch refers to Adam if he was a computer science grad student, with a 40% chance he was in a different field.
