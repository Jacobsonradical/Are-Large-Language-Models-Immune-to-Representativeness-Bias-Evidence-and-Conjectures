Here is my estimate, based on the information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature and plants, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy and loves animals. This profile could potentially fit a variety of fields, including life sciences, environmental science, veterinary medicine, etc. 

While an intelligent person with an aptitude for abstract concepts could certainly excel in computer science, the strong emphasis on curiosity about nature/plants and love of animals in the personality sketch makes me think it's less than a 50% probability that the sketch is referring to a computer science student, given that the sketch is not about Adam's actual field of study. Computer science is a bit less directly related to those mentioned interests compared to some other possible fields. 

However, there is still a reasonable probability that the sketch could be about a computer science student, since the abstract thinking and puzzle-solving skills mentioned are highly relevant. And of course, having outside interests in the natural world is fully compatible with studying computer science. So I estimate a moderate 40% probability for this field based on the sketch details provided.
