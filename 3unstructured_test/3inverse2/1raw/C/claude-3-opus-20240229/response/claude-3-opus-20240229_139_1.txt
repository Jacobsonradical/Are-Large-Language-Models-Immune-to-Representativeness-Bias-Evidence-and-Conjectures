Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, ecology, psychology, or animal science, rather than computer science. However, there is still some possibility he could be in computer science given his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts. Without more specific information tying his interests directly to the field of study, I estimate a relatively low 30% probability that the sketch is referring to Adam if he was actually a computer science graduate student.
