Here is my estimate of the probability that the given personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described - curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work - could apply to many different fields of graduate study. While some of the traits like problem-solving and abstract thinking align with computer science, the overall description doesn't strongly indicate computer science compared to other possible fields. So I estimate a 30% probability that Adam studied computer science specifically, based on the limited information provided.
