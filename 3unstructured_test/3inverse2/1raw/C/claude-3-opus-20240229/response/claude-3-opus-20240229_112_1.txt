Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving seem quite compatible with studying computer science. However, the strong emphasis on empathy, animals, and nature makes me think there is a reasonable chance Adam may have studied something else, perhaps related to biology, zoology, or environmental science. Therefore, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student.
