Here is my estimate, based on the limited information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has high empathy, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem to align fairly well with someone who might pursue computer science. The interest in puzzles, aptitude for abstract concepts, and strong intelligence in particular are common among computer science students and professionals. However, the curiosity about nature and plants, and love of animals, are less directly related. Therefore, I estimate there is a moderate probability of around 0.6 that the sketch describes Adam if he was a computer science graduate student, based on the information given. But more details would be needed to make a confident determination.
