Here is my estimate, based on the provided personality sketch and the field in question:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy. While these traits could fit well with many fields, they seem particularly well-suited for computer science, which involves abstract problem solving and requires strong analytical intelligence. The curiosity about nature and love of animals is less directly relevant but shows an inquisitive mind. Therefore, even if Adam was not actually studying computer science, I estimate a 60% probability that this personality sketch could describe a computer science graduate student.
