Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps certain humanities. Computer science tends to attract those with strong math, logic and technical skills. So while it's certainly possible Adam was a computer science grad student, I'd put the probability as fairly low, around 0.3, given his described personality traits. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
