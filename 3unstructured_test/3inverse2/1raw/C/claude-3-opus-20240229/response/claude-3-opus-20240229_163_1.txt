Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to someone in computer science, they seem more directly applicable to fields like biology, psychology, or veterinary science. Computer science does involve problem solving and abstract thinking to an extent. However, the strong emphasis on nature, plants and animals in the personality sketch makes me think it's more likely describing a graduate student in a life science or social science field, rather than computer science specifically. That said, the traits are general enough that I wouldn't completely rule out the possibility it's describing a computer science student. So I estimate a 40% chance the sketch is about Adam if he was a computer science graduate student.
