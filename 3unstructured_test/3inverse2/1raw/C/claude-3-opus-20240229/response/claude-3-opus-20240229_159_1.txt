Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious, intelligent, empathetic, and appreciates hard work and abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem reasonably well-aligned with computer science, which involves complex problem solving, abstract thinking, and dedication. However, without more specific information indicating Adam is studying computer science, I don't have high confidence he is in that particular field compared to various other possibilities. So I estimate a 60% chance based on the limited information provided.
