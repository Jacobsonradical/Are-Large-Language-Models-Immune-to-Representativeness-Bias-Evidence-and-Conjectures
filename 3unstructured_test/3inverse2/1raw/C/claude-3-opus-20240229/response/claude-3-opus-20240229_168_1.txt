Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and background information:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding of abstract concepts could fit well with someone studying computer science. However, the strong emphasis on curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love of animals seems less typical for that field compared to some others. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying computer science, I'd estimate the probability is only around 40% based on the sketch provided.
