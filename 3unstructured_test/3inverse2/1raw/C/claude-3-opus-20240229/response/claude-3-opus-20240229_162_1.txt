Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract thinking. While these qualities could apply to some computer science students, they seem more typical of students in fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or philosophy that deal with abstract reasoning. Therefore, if Adam was not actually a computer science student, I estimate there is only a 30% chance this personality sketch would describe him, based on the details provided. Of course, this is a very rough estimate given the limited information available.
