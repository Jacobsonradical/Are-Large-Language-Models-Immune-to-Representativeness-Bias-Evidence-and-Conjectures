Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and an ability to understand abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more directly relevant to fields like biology, zoology, animal science, psychology, or environmental science. So I estimate a 30% probability that the personality sketch is of a computer science graduate student, given that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in a different field than the one described.
