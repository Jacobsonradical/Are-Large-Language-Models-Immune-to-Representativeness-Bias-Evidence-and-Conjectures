Here is my estimate, based on the limited information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, as well as empathy and a love for animals. This could fit with many fields of graduate study. 

However, it also notes high intelligence, skill at understanding abstract concepts, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits are common among computer science students and professionals.

Without more specific information tying the subject's interests directly to computer science, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch is of a computer science graduate student, given that we know Adam was a graduate student in some field in the U.S. in 2021.
