Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the fact that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts could fit well with someone studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature and plants, along with empathy and love of animals, makes me think there is a reasonable chance his graduate studies may have been in another field like biology, ecology, or veterinary medicine. So I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch is referring to Adam if he was a computer science graduate student.
