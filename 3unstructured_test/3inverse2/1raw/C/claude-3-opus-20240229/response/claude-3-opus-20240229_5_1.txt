Here is my estimate, based on the provided personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, which could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants and animals makes me think there is a reasonable chance Adam may have studied something in the life sciences or environmental sciences instead. So I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student.
