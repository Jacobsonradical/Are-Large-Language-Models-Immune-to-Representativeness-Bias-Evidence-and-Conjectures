Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if Adam was a graduate student in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract thinking. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more typical of students in fields like biology, ecology, zoology, or perhaps certain humanities. Computer science tends to attract those more interested in technology, programming, and applied problem-solving. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying CS, I'd put the probability around 0.3 based on the personality description provided.
