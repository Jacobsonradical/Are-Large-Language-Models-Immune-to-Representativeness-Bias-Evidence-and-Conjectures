Here is my estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, empathetic, loves nature and animals, and is good at abstract thinking and problem solving. While this could describe people in many different fields, I think there is a fairly good chance it describes a computer science student, as computer science requires strong abstract thinking, problem solving, and intelligence. The other traits around empathy, love of nature, etc. are less directly related to computer science. So I estimate the probability is around 0.6 that this sketch describes a computer science graduate student, given that we know Adam was a graduate student in the US in some field in 2021.
