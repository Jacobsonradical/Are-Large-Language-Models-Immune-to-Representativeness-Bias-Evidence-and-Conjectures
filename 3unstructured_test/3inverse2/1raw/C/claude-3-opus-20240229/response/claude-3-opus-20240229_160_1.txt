Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The description of curiosity about nature, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could certainly apply to someone studying computer science. However, the specific mentions of interest in plants, animals and abstract concepts makes me think fields like biology, zoology, or mathematics might be a bit more likely. So I'd estimate a 60% chance the sketch is of a computer science student, with a 40% chance of another field being more probable given those details.
