Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, and understanding of abstract concepts, could potentially fit a variety of fields. However, the strong focus on nature, plants, and animals in the sketch suggests Adam may have been more likely to study a field related to the natural world rather than computer science. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch is describing a computer science student, given that Adam was enrolled in a different field.
