Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who loves nature, animals, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. While it's certainly possible for a computer science student to have those traits, the strong interests in nature and animals along with no mention of math, technology or engineering leads me to believe it's more likely the student is in a field like biology, ecology, or veterinary medicine rather than computer science. However, the sketch does mention high intelligence and facility with abstract concepts, so computer science can't be ruled out. That's why I estimate a 30% chance the student is in computer science if not the actual field they were in.
