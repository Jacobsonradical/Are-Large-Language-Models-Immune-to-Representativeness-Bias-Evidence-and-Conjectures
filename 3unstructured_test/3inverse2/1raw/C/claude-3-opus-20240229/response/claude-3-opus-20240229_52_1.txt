Here is my estimate, based on the personality sketch and the information provided about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, could apply to many different fields of graduate study. While it's certainly possible Adam was studying computer science, as it involves abstract thinking and problem solving, the sketch doesn't provide strong evidence to indicate computer science specifically over various other possibilities. So I estimate a 30% chance based on the limited information given.
