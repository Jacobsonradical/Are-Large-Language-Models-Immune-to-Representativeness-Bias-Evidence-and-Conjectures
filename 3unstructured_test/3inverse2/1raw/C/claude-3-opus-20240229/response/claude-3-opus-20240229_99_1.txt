Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits described - curiosity about nature and plants, enjoying puzzles, empathy and love of animals, high intelligence, and appreciating hard work and dedication - could certainly apply to someone in computer science. However, the strong emphasis on curiosity about nature and plants in particular makes me think it's more likely Adam was studying something in the natural sciences like biology, botany, environmental science, etc. The other traits are quite general and could align with many fields. So I estimate a 40% chance the sketch is referring to a computer science student, and a 60% chance it's referring to a graduate student in a different field, most likely a natural science.
