Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who has a curiosity about nature, enjoys puzzles, has empathy and a love for animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While some of these traits could apply to a computer science student, the emphasis on nature, animals, and abstract thinking suggests fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps mathematics or physics may be more likely. The 0.3 probability reflects that while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, the details in the personality sketch point more toward other fields of graduate study.
