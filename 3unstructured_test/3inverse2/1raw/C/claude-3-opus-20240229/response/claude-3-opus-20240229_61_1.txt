Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the additional information about Adam being a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals suggests other possible fields of study as well. Given the limited information provided, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch describes a computer science graduate student, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field than computer science.
