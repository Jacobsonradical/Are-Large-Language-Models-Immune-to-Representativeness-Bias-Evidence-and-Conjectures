Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, could potentially align with a variety of fields of graduate study. However, the mention of puzzle-solving skills and high intelligence suggests a reasonable probability that the subject may have pursued a technical or scientific field like computer science. At the same time, the sketch does not provide definitive evidence that computer science was Adam's field of study. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.6 that the personality sketch refers to Adam if he studied a field other than computer science. This reflects a slight lean towards computer science being a likely fit based on the traits mentioned, while acknowledging significant uncertainty given the limited information provided.
