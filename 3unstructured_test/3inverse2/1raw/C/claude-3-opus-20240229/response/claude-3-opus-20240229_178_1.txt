Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, I believe there is a reasonable chance they describe a computer science graduate student. Computer science requires strong abstract and analytical thinking abilities. At the same time, the love of nature and animals, and warm empathetic personality, are less stereotypically associated with computer science. So I estimate a 60% chance this sketch is of a computer science student, but it very well could be a student in another field as well.
