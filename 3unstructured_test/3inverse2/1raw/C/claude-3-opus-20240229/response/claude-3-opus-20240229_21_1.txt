Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem particularly well-suited for someone in a scientific field that involves studying natural phenomena, such as biology, environmental science, ecology, botany, or zoology. Computer science is a more abstract and mathematical field that doesn't directly involve nature. So while an intelligent person with these traits certainly could be in computer science, I estimate there is only a moderate probability (0.6) that Adam was in computer science specifically, assuming he was in a different graduate field than computer science. The sketch seems more likely to match someone in a natural science field.
