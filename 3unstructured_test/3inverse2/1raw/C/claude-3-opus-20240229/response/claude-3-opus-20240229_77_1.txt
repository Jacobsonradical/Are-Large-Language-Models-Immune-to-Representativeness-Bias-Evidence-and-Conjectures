Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem particularly well-aligned with someone studying life sciences, environmental science, animal behavior, or a related field. Computer science is a more abstract and technical field that relies less on understanding nature and animals. So while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I estimate there is only a 60% chance of that being his field of study based on the given personality description. The sketch points more toward him likely being in a field involving nature, plants, animals and abstract concepts related to the life and environmental sciences. But computer science can't be ruled out entirely.
