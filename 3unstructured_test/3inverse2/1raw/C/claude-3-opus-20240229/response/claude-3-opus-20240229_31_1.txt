Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes traits that could be applicable to many fields of graduate study, not just computer science. Qualities like curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciating hard work and dedication are fairly general positive traits that don't necessarily indicate a specific field of study. However, enjoying puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts may somewhat point towards an analytical field like computer science. So I'd estimate a 60% chance the sketch is referring to a computer science student, even if we know Adam himself studied a different field. But there's still a reasonable likelihood it could describe a student in various other disciplines as well, given the general nature of many of the traits listed.
