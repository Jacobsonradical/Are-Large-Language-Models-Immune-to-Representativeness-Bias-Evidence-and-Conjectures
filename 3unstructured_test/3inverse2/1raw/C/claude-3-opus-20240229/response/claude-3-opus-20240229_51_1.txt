Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity, problem-solving skills, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, could fit well with someone studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals suggests other possible fields of study as well. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that the sketch describes a computer science graduate student named Adam, given the limited information provided.
