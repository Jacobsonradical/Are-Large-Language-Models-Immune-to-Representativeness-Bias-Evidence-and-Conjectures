Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information about Adam being a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less directly relevant to computer science. Since Adam was a graduate student in some field in the U.S. in 2021, there is a reasonable probability he may have been studying computer science, but the personality sketch is not a slam dunk match for that particular field. Therefore, I estimate the probability at 0.6, meaning I believe there is a 60% chance the sketch is referring to Adam if he was a computer science grad student.
