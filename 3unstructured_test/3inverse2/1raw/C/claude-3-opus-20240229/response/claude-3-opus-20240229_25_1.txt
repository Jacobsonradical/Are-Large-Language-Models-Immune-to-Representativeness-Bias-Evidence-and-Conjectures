Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, curious about nature and abstract concepts, empathetic, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to graduate students across many fields, they seem particularly well-aligned with someone studying a scientific field related to nature, such as biology, ecology, environmental science, etc. Computer science is a more abstract and mathematical field that involves less direct study of nature and animals.

So while it's certainly possible Adam could have these traits while being a computer science student, I estimate there is a somewhat higher probability of around 60% that the sketch describes Adam if he was actually studying a different field more directly related to nature and life sciences. But the traits are general enough that I don't think the probability is extremely high that it must be a different field than CS.
