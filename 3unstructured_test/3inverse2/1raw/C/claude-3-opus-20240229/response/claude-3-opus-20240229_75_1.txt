Here is my estimate, based on the limited information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who loves nature, animals, and abstract thinking. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more typical of students in life sciences, environmental studies, or certain humanities fields. Computer science tends to attract those more interested in technology, math, and building software systems. So while it's certainly possible Adam was a computer science grad student, I'd estimate only a moderate probability of around 0.3 based solely on the personality description provided.
