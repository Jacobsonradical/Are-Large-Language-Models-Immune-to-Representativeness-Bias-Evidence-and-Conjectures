Here is my estimate, based on the information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, as well as empathy and a love for animals. This could fit with a variety of fields of graduate study. While computer science is certainly a possibility for someone of high intelligence who is good at understanding abstract concepts, the other details in the sketch related to nature, plants and animals make me think a field of study related to the natural world may be more likely, such as biology, environmental science, ecology, etc. So while computer science is definitely possible, I'd estimate the probability a bit lower than some other potential fields, around 0.6.
