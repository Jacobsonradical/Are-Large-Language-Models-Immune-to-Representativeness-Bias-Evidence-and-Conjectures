Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking, empathetic, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem particularly well-aligned with computer science, which requires strong abstract and analytical thinking skills. The appreciation for nature's complexity also seems compatible with an interest in the complex systems studied in computer science. However, the sketch doesn't mention some traits commonly associated with CS such as a specific interest in technology and computers. Therefore, while I think there is a better than 50% chance Adam studied computer science based on the given description, I don't have extremely high confidence in that assessment, so I estimate the probability at 0.6.
