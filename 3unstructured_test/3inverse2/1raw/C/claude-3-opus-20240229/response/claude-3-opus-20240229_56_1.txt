Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, could apply to many graduate students across various fields. However, the mention of enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests a slightly higher likelihood of the subject being in a field like computer science. Therefore, even if Adam was not actually studying computer science, I estimate there is still a 60% chance the sketch could be describing him based on the traits listed.
