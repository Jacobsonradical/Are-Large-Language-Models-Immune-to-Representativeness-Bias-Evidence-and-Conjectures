Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, if he was enrolled in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits mentioned like curiosity about nature and plants, enjoying puzzles, empathy and love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciating hard work and dedication could apply to many graduate students across various fields. While perhaps slightly more common in the life sciences, they are not exclusive to any one area of study. So I estimate a 60% chance the description could fit Adam even if he studied something other than computer science.
