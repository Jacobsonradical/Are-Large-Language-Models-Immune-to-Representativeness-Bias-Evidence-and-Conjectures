Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong empathy, love of nature and animals may be less common for that field compared to some others. Given the limited information, I estimate a moderate probability of around 0.6 that the sketch describes a computer science graduate student.
