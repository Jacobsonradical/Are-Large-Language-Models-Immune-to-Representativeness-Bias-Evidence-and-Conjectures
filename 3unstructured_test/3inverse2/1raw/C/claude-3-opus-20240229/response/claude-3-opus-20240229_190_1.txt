Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love of animals, high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could apply to many graduate students across various fields. However, an aptitude for solving puzzles and grasping abstractions does seem more common among those in technical and scientific disciplines like computer science compared to some other fields. So while it could certainly describe a grad student in another area, I estimate a slightly higher than 50% chance that it is a computer science student based on the limited information provided.
