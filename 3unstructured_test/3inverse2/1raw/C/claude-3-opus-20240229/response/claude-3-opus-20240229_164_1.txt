Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and Adam's graduate student status in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The subject's strong curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could potentially align well with studying computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes empathy, love of nature and animals, and appreciation for hard work, which could point to various other fields of study as well. Without more specific information indicating computer science, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that computer science was Adam's field of graduate study, based on the personality description provided.
