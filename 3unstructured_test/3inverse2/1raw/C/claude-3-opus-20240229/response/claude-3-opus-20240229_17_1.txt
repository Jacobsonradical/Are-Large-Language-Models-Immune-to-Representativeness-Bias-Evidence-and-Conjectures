Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with interests in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more typical of students in fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or philosophy. The strong empathy and love of animals in particular make me think the probability is a bit less than 50% that Adam was studying computer science as opposed to one of those other fields, given this personality profile. Of course, there is still a reasonable chance that Adam could have these interests while being a computer science student.
