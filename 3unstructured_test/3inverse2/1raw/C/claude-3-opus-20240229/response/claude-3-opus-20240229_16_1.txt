Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the specified format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, could fit well with someone studying computer science. However, the strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student, based on the limited information provided.
