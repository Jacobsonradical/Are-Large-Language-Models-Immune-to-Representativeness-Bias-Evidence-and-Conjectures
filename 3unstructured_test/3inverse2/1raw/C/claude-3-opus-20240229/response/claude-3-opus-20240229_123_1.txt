Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who loves nature, animals, and abstract thinking. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more typical of students in life sciences, environmental studies, or certain humanities fields. The sketch doesn't mention specific technical or mathematical aptitude that would point strongly to computer science. So I estimate a 30% chance the sketch is of a computer science student, and a higher probability it describes a student in a different field, based on the limited information provided.
