Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, as well as qualities like empathy and appreciation for hard work. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more typical of students in fields like biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, or psychology. Therefore, I estimate there is only a 30% chance the sketch is referring to Adam if he was actually a computer science grad student, since the described interests and personality traits are not as strongly associated with that particular field of study.
