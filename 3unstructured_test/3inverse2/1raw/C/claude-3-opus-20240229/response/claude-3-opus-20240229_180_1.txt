Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in computer science, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving, intelligent, empathetic, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem quite compatible with studying computer science. The curiosity, problem-solving skills, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are all important for success in computer science. However, the strong interest in nature and love of animals are less directly relevant. Therefore, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch could be describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student, based on the partial but not total overlap in characteristics.
