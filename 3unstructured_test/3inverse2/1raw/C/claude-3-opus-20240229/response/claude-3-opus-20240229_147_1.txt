Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature and plants, good at abstract thinking, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, I think the focus on nature, plants and animals suggests the person is more likely studying something in the life sciences or environmental sciences rather than computer science specifically. So I estimate only a 30% chance that a graduate student with this personality would be studying computer science as opposed to other possible fields. But there is still some possibility since computer science does involve abstract thinking and problem solving which are mentioned.
