Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and high intelligence, could potentially align with many different fields of graduate study. While the abstract thinking and puzzle-solving aspects could fit well with computer science, the other traits seem less specific to that particular field. Without more context about Adam's specific interests and background, computer science seems like a reasonable possibility but not an especially likely one compared to various other graduate fields he may have pursued. Therefore, I estimate a 40% probability that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science grad student, based on the limited information provided.
