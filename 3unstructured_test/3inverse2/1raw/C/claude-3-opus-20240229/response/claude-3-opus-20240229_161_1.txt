Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature and plants, good at abstract thinking, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to many fields, I think there is a reasonable chance they describe a computer science student, as computer science requires strong abstract and analytical thinking abilities. The interest in nature is less directly related, but a general curiosity and interest in how things work is common among computer scientists. So while not definitive, I estimate a 60% probability that this personality sketch could describe Adam if he was a computer science graduate student.
