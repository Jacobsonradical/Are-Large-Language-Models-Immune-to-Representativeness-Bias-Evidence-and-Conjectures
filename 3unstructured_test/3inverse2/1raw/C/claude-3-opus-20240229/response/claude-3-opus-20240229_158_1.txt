Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, could align with someone studying computer science. However, the strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Without more specific information indicating Adam's field of study, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that the sketch describes a computer science graduate student, given that it is a different field than his actual one.
