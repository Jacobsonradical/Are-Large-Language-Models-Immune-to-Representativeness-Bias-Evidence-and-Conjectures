Here is my estimate, based on the information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch mentions curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work. While these traits could apply to someone in any field, they seem more typically associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine rather than computer science. 

However, the sketch also mentions high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles. These traits are quite compatible with studying computer science.

Without more specific information indicating aptitude or interest in programming, algorithms, software engineering etc., computer science seems possible but not the most likely field based on the personality description. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch is of Adam if he was a computer science graduate student, based on the limited information available.
