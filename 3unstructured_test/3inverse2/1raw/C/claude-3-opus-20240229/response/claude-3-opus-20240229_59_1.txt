Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, empathetic, and able to grasp abstract concepts well. While these traits could apply to many different fields, they seem quite compatible with computer science, which involves abstract thinking, problem-solving, and often working to model or understand natural or real-world systems. The mention of enjoying solving puzzles also seems to fit well with the analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science.

However, the sketch doesn't mention any specific technical interests or skills that would clearly point to computer science over other STEM fields. The interest in nature and animals could also suggest possible interest in fields like biology. 

So while computer science seems like a reasonably probable fit given Adam's personality profile, without more specific information, I don't feel fully confident ruling out other fields. Therefore I estimate the probability at 0.6, meaning it's more likely than not that the sketch is of a computer science student, but far from certain based on the limited information provided.
