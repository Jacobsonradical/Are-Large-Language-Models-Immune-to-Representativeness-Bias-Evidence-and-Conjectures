Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in computer science, given that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits align reasonably well with someone who might study computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes a curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and a warm heart. While these qualities certainly don't preclude studying computer science, they are less strongly associated with that field compared to the analytical traits. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that the sketch describes Adam if he was a computer science graduate student.
