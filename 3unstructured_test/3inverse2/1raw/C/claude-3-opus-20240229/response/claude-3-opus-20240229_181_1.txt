Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, it seems reasonably likely that Adam could be studying computer science. However, since the sketch doesn't mention anything definitively pointing to computer science, and the traits could align with various other fields as well, I estimate the probability at 0.6 rather than higher. The sketch leaves open the significant possibility that he studied another field.
