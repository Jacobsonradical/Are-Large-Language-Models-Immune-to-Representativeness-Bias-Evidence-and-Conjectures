Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who loves nature, is empathetic, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to someone in any field, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine rather than computer science. Computer science tends to attract more analytical, abstract thinkers. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying CS, I'd estimate only a 30% chance the sketch is describing a CS grad student based on the details provided.
