Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with qualities like empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits could apply to a computer science student, they seem to more strongly align with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. So while it's certainly possible Adam was a computer science grad student, I estimate a lower probability of around 0.3 given the details in the personality sketch.
