Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving. These traits could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in plants and animals makes me think biology or environmental science could also be likely fields. Given Adam is a graduate student, computer science seems like a reasonable probability but I don't have enough information to say definitively. So I estimate a 60% chance the personality sketch is of a computer science student, based on the limited information provided.
