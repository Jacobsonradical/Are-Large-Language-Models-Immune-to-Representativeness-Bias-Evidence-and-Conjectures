Here is my estimate, based on the provided personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem particularly well-suited for computer science, which involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and a deep curiosity and desire to understand complex systems. The 0.6 probability reflects that these characteristics align reasonably well with computer science, though without more specific information, it's difficult to say definitively. The probability allows for the possibility Adam could have pursued other fields as well.
