Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and is good at abstract thinking. While these traits could apply to people in many different fields, they seem to align reasonably well with someone who might be drawn to computer science. Curiosity, puzzle-solving skills, and facility with abstract concepts are all strengths for a computer science student. However, the strong interest in nature and animals makes me think there is also a reasonable chance the sketch could be describing someone in a life sciences field. Therefore, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student.
