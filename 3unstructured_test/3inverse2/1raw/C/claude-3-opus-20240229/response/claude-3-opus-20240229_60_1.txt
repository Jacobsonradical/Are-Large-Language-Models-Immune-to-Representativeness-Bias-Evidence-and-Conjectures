Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has empathy and loves animals, grasps abstract concepts, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more broadly applicable to many other fields as well, such as biology, psychology, or veterinary medicine. The sketch doesn't mention specific technical or programming interests that would suggest a strong likelihood of studying computer science. Therefore, if Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in a different field than computer science, I estimate there is only a 30% chance this personality sketch is describing him.
