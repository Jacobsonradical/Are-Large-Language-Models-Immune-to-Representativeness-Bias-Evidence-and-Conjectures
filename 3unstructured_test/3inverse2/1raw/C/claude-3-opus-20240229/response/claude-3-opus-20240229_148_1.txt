Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits could align well with studying computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes curiosity about nature, plants, animals and a warm heart and strong empathy. While computer science students can certainly have those qualities too, they are less directly related to the typical focus areas of that field. So while it's quite possible the sketch is describing a computer science student, I wouldn't say it's a near certainty based on the information provided. My rough estimate is that there is a 60% chance the sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student in 2021.
