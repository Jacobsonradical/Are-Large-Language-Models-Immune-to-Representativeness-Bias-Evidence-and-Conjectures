Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, if Adam was enrolled in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described - curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and having empathy - could fit someone in a variety of fields. However, they align reasonably well with someone who might choose to study computer science. The curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence and abstract thinking are common traits for that field. So while it's certainly possible Adam studied something else, I'd estimate a 60% chance the sketch describes a computer science student, even if we know it wasn't Adam specifically. But there's still a good chance it could be a different field.
