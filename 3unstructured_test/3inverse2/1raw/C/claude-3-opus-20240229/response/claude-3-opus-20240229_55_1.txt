Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who has a love of nature, animals, and abstract concepts, as well as empathy and appreciation for hard work. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem somewhat more likely for a biologist, veterinarian, or philosopher rather than a computer scientist. However, there are certainly computer science students who fit this description, so I would estimate a 60% chance the sketch is about Adam even if he studied a field other than CS. The sketch is quite general and could plausibly match students across a range of disciplines.
