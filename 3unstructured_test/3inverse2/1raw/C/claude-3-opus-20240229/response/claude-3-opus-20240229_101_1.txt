Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could align with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and puzzles seems less directly related to typical computer science studies. So while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I estimate a moderate 40% probability based on the personality description provided.
