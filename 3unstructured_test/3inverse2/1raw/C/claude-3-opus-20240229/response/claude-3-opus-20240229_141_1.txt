Here is my estimate, based on the information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking, and intelligent. While this could apply to many different fields, computer science does involve abstract problem-solving skills. The subject's love of nature is less directly relevant to computer science, but an appreciation for complex systems could draw someone to both nature and computing. Overall, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch could describe a computer science graduate student, but it could certainly apply to other fields as well.
