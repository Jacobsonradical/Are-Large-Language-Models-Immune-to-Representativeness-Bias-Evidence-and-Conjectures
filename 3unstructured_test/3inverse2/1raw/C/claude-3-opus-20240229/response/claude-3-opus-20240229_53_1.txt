Here is my estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, including but not limited to computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants, along with his empathy and love of animals, could point to fields like biology, ecology, or veterinary science. However, his intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and skill at solving puzzles are traits that could lend themselves well to computer science. Still, without more specific information indicating a strong interest or background in computer science, I'd estimate only a moderate probability of around 0.4 that the sketch is describing a computer science graduate student, assuming he was in a different field than computer science.
