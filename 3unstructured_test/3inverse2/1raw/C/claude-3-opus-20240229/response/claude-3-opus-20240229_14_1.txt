Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, which aligns well with computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals is less typical for that field, so I estimate the probability is only moderately high that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student.
