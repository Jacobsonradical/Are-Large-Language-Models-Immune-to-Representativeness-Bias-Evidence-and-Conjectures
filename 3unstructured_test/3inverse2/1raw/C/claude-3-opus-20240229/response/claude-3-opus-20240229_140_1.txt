Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in a field different from computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to someone in any field, they seem slightly more typical of someone in the life sciences or a helping profession rather than computer science. However, there is still a decent chance the sketch could describe a computer science student, as intelligence and abstract thinking are important in that field. Therefore, I estimate a 40% probability the sketch is of Adam if he was not actually a computer science graduate student.
