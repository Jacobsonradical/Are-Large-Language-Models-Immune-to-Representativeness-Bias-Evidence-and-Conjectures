Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, empathetic, and appreciates hard work and abstract concepts. While these traits could align with many fields, they seem reasonably well-suited to computer science, which involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and dedication. However, the strong interest in nature and animals makes me think fields like biology could also be a good fit. So I estimate a 60% chance that the sketch is describing a computer science student, given that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in a different field than the one in question.
