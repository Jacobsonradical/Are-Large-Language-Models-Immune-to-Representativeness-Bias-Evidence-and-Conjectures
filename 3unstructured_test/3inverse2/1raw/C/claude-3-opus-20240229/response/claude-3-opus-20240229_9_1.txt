Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could apply to many people across various fields of graduate study. However, skills like puzzle-solving and understanding abstract concepts may be somewhat more common in STEM fields like computer science compared to some other disciplines. Therefore, I estimate there is a moderate 60% probability the sketch could be describing Adam if he studied a field other than CS. But the traits are general enough that they could potentially describe students in many different graduate programs.
