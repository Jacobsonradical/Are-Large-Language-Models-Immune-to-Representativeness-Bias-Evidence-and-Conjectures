Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature and plants, good at abstract thinking, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem particularly well-suited for a life science field like biology or botany rather than a more technical field like computer science. However, plenty of computer science students are also curious about nature and good at abstract reasoning. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that the sketch is describing Adam if he studied a field other than computer science. The traits are general enough that they could plausibly fit a CS student, but seem more likely to describe someone in the life sciences or another field more directly connected to nature.
