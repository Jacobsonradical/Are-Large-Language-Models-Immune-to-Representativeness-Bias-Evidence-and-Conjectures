Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract thinking. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more indicative of a student in the natural sciences, such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology. Therefore, if Adam was a graduate student in a field other than computer science, I estimate there is only a 30% chance this personality sketch is describing him.
