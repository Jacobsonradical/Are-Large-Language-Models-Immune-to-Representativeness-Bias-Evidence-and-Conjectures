Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or animal behavior rather than computer science. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy suggest he may be more likely to study a life science field.

However, the sketch also mentions he enjoys puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which could fit with computer science to some degree. And of course, people can have varied interests outside their primary field of study.

So while computer science doesn't seem like the most probable match given the details provided, I don't think it can be ruled out entirely. A probability around 0.4 (40%) seems reasonable to me - it's definitely possible but less likely than him being in a more naturally-aligned field based on the personality description. Let me know if you would like me to explain my reasoning further!
