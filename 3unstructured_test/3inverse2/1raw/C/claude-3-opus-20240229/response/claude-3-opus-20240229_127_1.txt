Here is my estimate, based on the personality sketch and the information provided about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who loves nature, animals, and abstract thinking. While these qualities could apply to some computer science students, they seem more strongly associated with other fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps mathematics. Computer science tends to attract those more interested in technology and programming. So while it's certainly possible Adam was a computer science grad student, I'd estimate only a 30% chance based on the personality description. The sketch seems more fitting of other fields of study.
