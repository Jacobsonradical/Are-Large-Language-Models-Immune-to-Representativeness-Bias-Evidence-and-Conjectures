Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who loves nature, animals, and abstract concepts. While this could potentially describe a computer science student, the traits seem more directly aligned with fields like biology, zoology, mathematics, or philosophy. Therefore, if Adam was a graduate student in a different field than computer science, I estimate there is only a 30% chance this personality sketch is describing him. The sketch lacks clear indicators that strongly point to computer science.
