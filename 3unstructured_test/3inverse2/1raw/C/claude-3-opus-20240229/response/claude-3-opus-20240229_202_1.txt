Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem to align reasonably well with someone who might study computer science. Computer science requires strong analytical and problem-solving skills, an ability to grasp abstract concepts, and dedication. The curiosity about nature and love of animals are less directly relevant but not incompatible. 

So while the sketch alone is not enough to say definitively that Adam studied computer science, I estimate a moderate probability of around 0.6 that he may have been enrolled in that field, based on the limited information provided. But there is still significant uncertainty.
