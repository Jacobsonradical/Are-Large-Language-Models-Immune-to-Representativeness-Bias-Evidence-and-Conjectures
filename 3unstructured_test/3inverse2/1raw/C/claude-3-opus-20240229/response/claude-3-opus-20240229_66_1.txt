Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciating hard work and dedication, could potentially fit a variety of fields. While they don't rule out computer science, they seem to more strongly suggest a field related to natural sciences, biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps psychology. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that the sketch is describing a computer science graduate student, given we know Adam was studying a different field.
