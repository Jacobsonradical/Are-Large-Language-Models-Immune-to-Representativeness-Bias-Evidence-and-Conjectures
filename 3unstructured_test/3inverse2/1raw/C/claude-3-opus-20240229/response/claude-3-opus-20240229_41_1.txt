Here is my estimate, based on the limited information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious about nature, enjoys problem-solving, is empathetic, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to someone in any field, the mentions of curiosity about nature and plants, as well as empathy and love for animals, make me think the probability this describes a computer science graduate student is only around 40%. The sketch feels more likely to fit someone in a field like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. However, there are certainly computer science students who have strong interests in nature and animals as well. The 40% estimate reflects the fact that it's plausible but I don't think it's the most likely match based on the description provided.
