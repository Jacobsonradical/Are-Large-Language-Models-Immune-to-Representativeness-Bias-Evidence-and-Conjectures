Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and abstract thinking, while certainly possible for a computer science student, seem more typical of someone in a field like biology, ecology, psychology, or veterinary medicine. So I estimate only a 30% chance the sketch is describing a computer science graduate student, given the information provided. Of course, this is just a rough estimate based on the limited information in the personality sketch.
