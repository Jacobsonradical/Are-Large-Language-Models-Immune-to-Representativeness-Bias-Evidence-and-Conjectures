Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and abstract thinking ability, could fit a variety of fields. While they don't rule out computer science, they seem more aligned with other areas like biology, veterinary medicine, mathematics, or even certain humanities and social sciences. So I estimate a 30% chance the sketch is describing a computer science student, given we know Adam studied something else. But there's considerable uncertainty in trying to determine a field of study from a brief personality description.
