Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and intelligence, could apply to many different fields of graduate study beyond just computer science. However, the mention of being good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoying solving puzzles does seem potentially compatible with studying computer science. Therefore, I estimate there is a moderate 40% chance the sketch could describe a computer science student, but it is more likely describing a student in another field given the other traits and interests mentioned.
