Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking ability, and dedication could align well with someone pursuing graduate studies in computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals is less typical for that field, so I estimate the probability is only moderately high at 0.6.
