Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that align well with someone who might study computer science, such as a curiosity about abstract concepts, enjoying solving puzzles, and high intelligence. However, the strong interest in nature and animals makes me think there is a reasonable chance his field could have been something different, like biology. So I estimate a 70% probability that computer science was his field of study.
