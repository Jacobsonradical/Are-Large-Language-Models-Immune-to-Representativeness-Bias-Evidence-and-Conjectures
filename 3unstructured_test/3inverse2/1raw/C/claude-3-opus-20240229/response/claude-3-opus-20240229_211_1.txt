Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity, intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts and problem-solving, could align well with a computer science student. However, the strong interest in nature, plants and animals makes me think there is a reasonable chance Adam could have studied another field related to the life sciences or environment. Without more specific information tying the traits to computer science, I estimate a moderate 60% probability that the sketch describes a computer science student, allowing for a significant 40% chance it could be a different field.
