Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and additional information:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch indicates someone who is intelligent, good with abstract concepts, and enjoys problem-solving. These traits could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals is less typical for a computer science student, so I don't think the probability is extremely high that the sketch is referring to Adam if he studied computer science. A probability around 0.6 seems reasonable to me given the mix of traits that both do and don't strongly align with a typical computer science student.
