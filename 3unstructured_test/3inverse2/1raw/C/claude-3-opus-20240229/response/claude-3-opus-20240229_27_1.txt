Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, highly intelligent, and able to understand abstract concepts well. While these traits could apply to graduate students across many fields, they seem particularly well-suited to a student of computer science, who would need to be intelligent, good with abstractions, and passionate about solving challenging problems. The curiosity about nature and plants is less directly related but not incompatible. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying a different field, I estimate a 60% chance the sketch is referring to a computer science student based on the details provided.
