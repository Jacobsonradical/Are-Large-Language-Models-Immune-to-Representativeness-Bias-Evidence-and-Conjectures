Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic and loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While these qualities could apply to people in many fields, they seem slightly more aligned with someone in a scientific field related to nature or animals, rather than computer science specifically. However, there is still a reasonable chance the sketch could describe a computer science student, as intelligence, puzzle-solving skills and dedication are certainly relevant in that field as well. Therefore, I estimate a 40% probability the sketch is about Adam if he studied a field other than CS.
