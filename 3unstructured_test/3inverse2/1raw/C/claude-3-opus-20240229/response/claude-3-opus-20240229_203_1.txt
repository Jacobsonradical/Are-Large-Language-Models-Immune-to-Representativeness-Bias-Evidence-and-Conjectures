Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem particularly well-aligned with someone who might pursue graduate studies in a scientific field related to nature, such as biology, ecology, zoology, or environmental science.

Computer science is a more abstract and technical field that deals with computation, algorithms, and artificial intelligence. While the sketch indicates high intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts, which would be useful in computer science, the strong emphasis on curiosity about nature, plants, and animals seems less directly relevant. 

Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam was studying computer science, I estimate the probability is only around 0.6, given the personality description. The traits seem more likely to describe someone in a field with a stronger connection to the natural world and living things. But computer science can't be ruled out by any means.
