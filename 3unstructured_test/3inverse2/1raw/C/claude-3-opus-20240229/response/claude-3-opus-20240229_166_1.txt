Here is my estimate, based on the information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, enjoys problem-solving, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to graduate students across many fields, they seem particularly well-aligned with someone studying computer science. The curiosity, aptitude for abstract concepts and problem-solving, and dedication are all common traits among computer science students and professionals. However, the strong interest in nature and animals is less stereotypically associated with computer science, so I wouldn't say the probability is extremely high. A value of 0.6 reflects a moderate-to-high probability that the sketch could be of a computer science graduate student like Adam, based on the limited information available.
