Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch depicts someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, empathetic, and good at understanding abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they align reasonably well with someone in computer science. Computer science requires strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which fits with enjoying puzzles and grasping abstract concepts. At the same time, the focus on nature, animals and empathy is less directly relevant to computer science.

So while the personality sketch is compatible with someone in computer science, it's not a slam dunk. I'd estimate a 60% probability that it describes Adam if he was a computer science grad student, with a fair amount of uncertainty. The sketch is general enough that it could plausibly fit grad students in a variety of other fields as well.
