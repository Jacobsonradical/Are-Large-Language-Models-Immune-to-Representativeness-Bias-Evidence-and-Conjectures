Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking, intelligent, and empathetic. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem fairly well-aligned with someone who might study computer science. Computer science requires strong abstract thinking skills, intelligence, and dedication. The other traits like empathy for animals and curiosity about plants seem less directly relevant to CS, but aren't incompatible with it either.

Since the personality sketch is a reasonably good overall fit for a computer science student even if not a perfect match, I estimate there is a 60% chance it describes Adam if he studied a field other than CS. The probability is greater than 50% but not extremely high, since the sketch is not uniquely specific to CS and could describe students in other STEM fields, humanities, or social sciences as well. Let me know if you would like me to explain my reasoning further!
