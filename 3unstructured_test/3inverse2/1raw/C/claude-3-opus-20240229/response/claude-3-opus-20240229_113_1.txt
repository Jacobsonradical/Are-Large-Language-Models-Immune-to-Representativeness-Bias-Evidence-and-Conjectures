Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and abstract thinking ability, while positive qualities, do not seem especially correlated with computer science compared to other possible fields of graduate study. So I estimate there is only a modest 30% chance the sketch is referring to a computer science student, based on the limited information provided.
