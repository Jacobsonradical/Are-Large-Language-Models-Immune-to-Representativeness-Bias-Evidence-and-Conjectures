Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, could potentially fit a computer science student. However, the sketch does not mention any specific interest or aptitude for technology, programming, or other computer science topics. Therefore, while it's possible Adam studied computer science, I estimate a lower probability of 0.3 given the information provided.
