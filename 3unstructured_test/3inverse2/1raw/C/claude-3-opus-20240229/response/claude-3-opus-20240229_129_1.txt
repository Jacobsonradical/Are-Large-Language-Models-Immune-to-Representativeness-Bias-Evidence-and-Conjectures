Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits could align well with someone studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less directly related to computer science. So while it's certainly possible the sketch is describing Adam as a computer science student, I don't think it's a near certainty based on the information provided. Therefore, I estimate the probability is around 0.6, or 60%.
