Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, as well as empathy and love for animals. This suggests fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine may be more likely than computer science. However, the sketch also notes high intelligence, skill with abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which are qualities that could certainly apply to computer science graduate students as well. Therefore, while I don't think computer science is the most likely field based on the personality description, I still think there is a reasonable probability (around 60%) that it could be his field of study.
