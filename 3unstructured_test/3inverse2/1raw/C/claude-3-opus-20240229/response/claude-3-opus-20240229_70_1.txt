Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy and love for animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to people in many different fields, they seem quite compatible with someone studying computer science. Computer science requires strong problem solving skills, abstract thinking, and diligence. At the same time, the interest in nature and animals is less directly relevant to computer science. Balancing these factors, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch describes a computer science graduate student, given that Adam was a graduate student in some field in the U.S. in 2021.
