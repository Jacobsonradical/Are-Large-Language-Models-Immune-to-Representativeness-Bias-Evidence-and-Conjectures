Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and is highly intelligent. While these traits could apply to graduate students across many disciplines, they seem to align quite well with someone in a life sciences field like biology, zoology, environmental science, etc. Computer science is a more abstract and technical field that, while requiring intelligence, doesn't necessarily involve curiosity about plants and animals.

However, the sketch is quite general and brief, so it's certainly possible it could describe a computer science student as well, especially one studying artificial intelligence, machine learning, or areas involving abstract problem solving. Given the limited information, I estimate a 60% chance the sketch is about a graduate student in a field other than computer science. But more details would be needed to assign a probability with high confidence.
