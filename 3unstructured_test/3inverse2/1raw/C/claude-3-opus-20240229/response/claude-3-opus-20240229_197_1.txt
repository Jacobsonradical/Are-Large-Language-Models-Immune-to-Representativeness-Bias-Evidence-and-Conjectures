Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem more typical of someone in natural sciences rather than computer science. The mention of a love for animals and plants in particular makes me think it is somewhat less likely the person is in computer science compared to fields like biology, environmental science, etc. However, the traits of being intelligent, a good problem solver and having an appreciation for hard work and dedication are certainly found among many computer science students. So while I believe the sketch is more likely to fit someone outside of CS, I wouldn't rule out the possibility either, hence my rough estimate of a 60% chance the person is in a field other than CS.
