Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and Adam's graduate student status in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts could fit well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Given the mixed alignment between the personality description and typical computer science traits, I estimate a moderate probability of around 0.6 that the sketch is of a computer science graduate student.
