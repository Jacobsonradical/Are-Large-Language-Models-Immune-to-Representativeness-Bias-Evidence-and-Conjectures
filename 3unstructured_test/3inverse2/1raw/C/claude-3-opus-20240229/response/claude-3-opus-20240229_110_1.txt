Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to graduate students across many fields, the mention of enjoying solving puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts makes me think there is a reasonable probability that Adam could have been studying computer science, even though the sketch doesn't mention that field specifically. Computer science involves problem-solving, puzzles, and abstract thinking. However, without more definitive information linking the traits to computer science, I don't feel I can assign more than a 60% probability. The traits are general enough that Adam realistically could have been studying a variety of other fields as well.
