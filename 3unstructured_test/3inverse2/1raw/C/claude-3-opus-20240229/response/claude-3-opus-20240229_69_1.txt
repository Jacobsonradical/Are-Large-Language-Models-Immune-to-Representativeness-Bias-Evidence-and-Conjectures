Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The description of enjoying solving puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts could potentially fit someone studying computer science. However, the strong emphasis on curiosity about nature, plants, animals, empathy, and appreciation of hard work and dedication seems less typical of a computer science student compared to some other fields. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying computer science, I estimate only a 20% probability based on the personality sketch provided.
