Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to someone in any field, they seem to align reasonably well with the profile of a computer science graduate student. A curiosity about nature could translate to an interest in studying natural systems. Enjoying puzzles and being good at abstract concepts are highly relevant to computer science. And of course, succeeding in graduate-level computer science requires intelligence, hard work and dedication.

At the same time, the sketch doesn't mention anything that concretely points to computer science, such as an interest in math, technology, or programming. The mention of empathy and love of animals is also not stereotypically associated with computer scientists.

Therefore, while the personality sketch is compatible with a computer science graduate student, it doesn't conclusively point to that field. So I estimate the probability is around 0.6, slightly better than a coin flip that the sketch is about Adam if he was a computer science grad student, but far from certain. The traits mentioned could also apply to many other fields.
