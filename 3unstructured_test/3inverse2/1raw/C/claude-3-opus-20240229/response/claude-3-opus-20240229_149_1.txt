Here is my estimate, based on the personality sketch and the given information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, could fit well with someone studying computer science. However, the strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Given Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in some field in 2021, I estimate a 60% chance the sketch is describing him if he studied a field other than computer science. But there is significant uncertainty in matching a brief personality profile to a particular individual and field of study.
