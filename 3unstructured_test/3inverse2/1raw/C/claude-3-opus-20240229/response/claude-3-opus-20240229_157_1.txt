Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic and loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem reasonably well-aligned with someone who might pursue computer science. Computer science requires strong problem-solving skills, abstract thinking ability, and dedication. At the same time, the emphasis on nature, plants and animals suggests possible interests in other fields like biology as well. So while computer science seems like a plausible fit, I wouldn't say it's a near-certainty based on the given description. A 60% probability reflects that it's more likely than not, but far from definitive, that the sketch is of a computer science student.
