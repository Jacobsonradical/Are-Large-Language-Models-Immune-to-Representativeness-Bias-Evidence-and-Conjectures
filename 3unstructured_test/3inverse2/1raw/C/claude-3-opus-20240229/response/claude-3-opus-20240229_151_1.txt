Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, ecology, psychology, or veterinary medicine rather than computer science. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those interests and traits to also pursue graduate studies in computer science. Without more specific information, I estimate there is roughly a 30% chance the sketch is referring to Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science.
