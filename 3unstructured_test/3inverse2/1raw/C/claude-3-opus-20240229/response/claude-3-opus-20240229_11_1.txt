Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, high intelligence, and appreciation of hard work. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they don't seem especially characteristic of computer science in particular. So if Adam was a graduate student in a different field, I'd estimate only a moderate 30% chance that this personality sketch is describing him specifically. The sketch seems more likely to fit someone in a field involving nature, animals, or more abstract/theoretical topics. But it's certainly possible it could describe a computer science student as well.
