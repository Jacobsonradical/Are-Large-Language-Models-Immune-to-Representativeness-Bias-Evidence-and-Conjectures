Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who has a deep interest in nature, empathy, and abstract thinking. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, the strong emphasis on nature, plants, and animals leads me to believe it is more likely Adam studied a field related to the natural sciences or possibly psychology. However, I wouldn't rule out computer science entirely, as the subject's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves well to that field too. So I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch is describing a computer science student, given Adam studied something else.
