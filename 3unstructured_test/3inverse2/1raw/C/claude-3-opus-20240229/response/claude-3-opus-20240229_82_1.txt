Here is my estimate, based on the personality sketch and the information provided about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The description suggests someone who is intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving, which could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants and animals makes me think biology or environmental science could be more likely fields of study for this individual than computer science. So while there is a reasonable chance Adam could have studied CS given his aptitude, I estimate the probability is only around 0.6 (60%) that the sketch is describing a computer science student, based on the other traits and interests mentioned.
