Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information about Adam being a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with someone studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals suggests fields like biology or environmental science could also be a good fit. Without more specific information, computer science seems a reasonable but not certain match for the described personality, so I estimate the probability at 0.6.
