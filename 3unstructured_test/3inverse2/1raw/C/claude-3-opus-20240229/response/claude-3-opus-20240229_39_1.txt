Here is my estimate, based on the limited information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic, and loves animals. While some computer science students certainly fit that description, the traits mentioned seem more typical of fields like biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, or psychology. Computer science tends to attract more abstract, mathematical thinkers. So while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I believe the probability is only around 30% based on the personality description alone. More information about Adam's specific interests and skills would help refine the estimate.
