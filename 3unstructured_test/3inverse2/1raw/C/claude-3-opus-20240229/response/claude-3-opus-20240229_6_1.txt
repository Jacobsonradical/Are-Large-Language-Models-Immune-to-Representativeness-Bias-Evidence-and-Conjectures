Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who has a deep curiosity and appreciation for nature, is good at abstract thinking, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more directly applicable to fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology. The "strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication" could fit well with rigorous STEM fields like computer science. But overall, based just on this limited sketch, I estimate only a 30% chance that Adam was studying computer science specifically in 2021, compared to other possible graduate fields. More details about his specific skills and interests would help narrow down the probability further.
