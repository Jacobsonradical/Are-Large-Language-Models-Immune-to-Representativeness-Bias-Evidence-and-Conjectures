Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, do not seem strongly correlated with computer science in particular. They could apply to a graduate student in a variety of other fields such as biology, psychology, mathematics, etc. Therefore, I estimate there is only a modest 30% chance that the sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science.
