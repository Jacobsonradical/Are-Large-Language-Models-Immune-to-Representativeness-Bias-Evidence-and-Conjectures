Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to people in many different fields, they seem more aligned with someone studying life sciences, environmental science, zoology, or a related field rather than computer science. Computer science tends to attract those more interested in technology, math and logic. So I'd estimate there's only a moderate probability, around 60%, that the sketch describes a computer science grad student compared to other possible fields of study that may be a better fit for the personality described.
