Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described could fit a variety of fields, but seem more aligned with someone studying life sciences, animal behavior, or perhaps philosophy rather than a highly technical field like computer science. However, it's certainly possible for a computer science student to have those traits and interests. Without more specific information tying the description to CS, I estimate a 30% chance the sketch is referring to Adam if he studied a different field.
