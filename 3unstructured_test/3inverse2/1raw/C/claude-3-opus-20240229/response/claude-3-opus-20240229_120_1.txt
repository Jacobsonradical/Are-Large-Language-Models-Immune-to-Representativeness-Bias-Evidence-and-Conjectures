Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the fact that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and strong empathy, do not seem to strongly align with typical traits of computer science students. Problem-solving skills and intelligence could fit many fields. Without more specific information indicating an interest in computers, programming, or technology, computer science seems less likely than some other potential fields of study for Adam. However, the sketch is quite general, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely.
