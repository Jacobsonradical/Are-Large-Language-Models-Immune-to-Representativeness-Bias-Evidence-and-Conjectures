Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who has interests and traits that could align with various fields of graduate study, such as biology, zoology, psychology, or other sciences. While an interest in abstract concepts and high intelligence could fit with computer science, the strong emphasis on curiosity about nature, plants, and animals suggests a higher likelihood of a different field of study. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 30% probability that this describes a computer science graduate student, assuming Adam was in a different field.
