Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who has a deep curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has high empathy and loves animals, is very intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. 

While some of these traits could apply to a computer science student, the strong emphasis on curiosity about nature/plants and love for animals makes me think it's more likely this person is studying something in the natural sciences like biology, botany, zoology, etc. rather than computer science.

However, since the sketch does mention intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem solving, which are also important in CS, I wouldn't rule it out entirely. That's why I estimated a 40% chance it could be a computer science student, but I think the odds lean more towards a different field of study given the overall profile. Let me know if you would like me to explain my reasoning further!
