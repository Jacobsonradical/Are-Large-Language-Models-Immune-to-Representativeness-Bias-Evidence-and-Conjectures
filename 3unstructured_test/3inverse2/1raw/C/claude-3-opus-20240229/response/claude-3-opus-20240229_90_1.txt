Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic and loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem particularly well-suited to someone studying a natural science field like biology, zoology, environmental science, etc. 

Computer science does involve problem-solving and abstract thinking, so there is some overlap. But the strong emphasis on curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love of animals makes me think it's more likely Adam was studying something in the life sciences rather than a technology field like computer science, if he was in a different graduate program than CS.

So I'd estimate a 60% probability the sketch is referring to Adam if he was in a non-CS field, with that probability being higher for natural science fields. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
