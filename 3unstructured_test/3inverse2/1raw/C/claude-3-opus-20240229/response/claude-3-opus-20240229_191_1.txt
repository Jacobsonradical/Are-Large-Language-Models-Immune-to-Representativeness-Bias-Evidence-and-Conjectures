Here is my estimate, based on the information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more typical of students in fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. So I estimate a 40% chance that a graduate student with the given personality was studying computer science, as opposed to a different field that may be a more natural fit for their interests and strengths. But without more specific information, it's hard to make a confident assessment.
