Here is my estimate, based on the personality sketch and the additional information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch focuses on curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits could apply to someone in any field, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine rather than computer science. However, the subject's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest they could potentially be suited for computer science as well. Given the limited information, I estimate a 30% probability that the personality sketch describes Adam if he was a computer science graduate student, but I think it's more likely his studies were in a field more directly related to nature, plants or animals.
