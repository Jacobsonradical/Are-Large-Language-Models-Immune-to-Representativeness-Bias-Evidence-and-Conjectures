Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in a graduate program other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, could fit quite well with someone studying computer science. However, they are also general enough that they could describe a graduate student in many other fields. Without more specific details pointing to computer science, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch is about Adam if he was in a different field of study.
