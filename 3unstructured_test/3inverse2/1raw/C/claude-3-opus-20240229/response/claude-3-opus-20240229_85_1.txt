Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving, which could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals is less typical for that field, so I estimate a moderate 60% probability that the sketch is describing a computer science graduate student, given no other information.
