Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described could potentially fit a computer science student, such as high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles. However, the strong emphasis on curiosity about nature, plants, animals and empathy makes me think it is more likely this person studied something in the natural sciences, environmental sciences, or possibly psychology or veterinary medicine. Therefore, if Adam was not actually studying computer science, I estimate only a 30% chance this description would be of him.
