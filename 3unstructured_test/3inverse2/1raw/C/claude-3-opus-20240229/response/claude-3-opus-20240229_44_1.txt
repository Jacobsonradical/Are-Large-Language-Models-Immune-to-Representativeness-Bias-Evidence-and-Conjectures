Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and abstract thinking ability, do not seem strongly correlated with computer science in particular. While some computer science students may have those traits, they seem more generally applicable to many fields. So I estimate only a 30% chance the sketch is referring to a computer science student, if we know Adam was enrolled in a different graduate program.
