Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and background information:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The described personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving skills, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit somewhat well with studying computer science. However, the strong emphasis on empathy, love of animals and nature seems less directly relevant to computer science compared to some other fields. So while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I estimate a moderate 40% probability based solely on this limited information provided.
