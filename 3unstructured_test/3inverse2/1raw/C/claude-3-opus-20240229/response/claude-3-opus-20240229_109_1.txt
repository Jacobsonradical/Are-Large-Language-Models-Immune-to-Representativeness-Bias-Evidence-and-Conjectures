Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information about Adam being a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch indicates someone who enjoys puzzles, has high intelligence, and can grasp abstract concepts well. These traits would align fairly well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less directly related to typical computer science studies. Given Adam was a graduate student, computer science seems like a reasonable possibility but not a certainty based on the personality description. Therefore, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch describes a computer science student.
