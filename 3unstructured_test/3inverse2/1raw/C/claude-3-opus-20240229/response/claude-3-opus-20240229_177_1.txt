Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and Adam's graduate student status in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving aptitude, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature and animals makes me think there is a decent chance Adam may have studied something in the life sciences or natural sciences instead. Therefore, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch describes Adam if he was a computer science graduate student in 2021.
