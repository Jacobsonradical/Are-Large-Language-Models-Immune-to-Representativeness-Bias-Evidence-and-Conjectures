Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking, intelligent, and has strong empathy. While this could match people in many different fields, I believe there is a reasonable probability that it describes a computer science student, as computer science requires strong abstract thinking skills, intellect, and often attracts people with broad curiosity. However, the emphasis on curiosity about plants and love of animals makes me think it could also fit students in other fields like biology. Therefore, I estimate the probability is around 0.6 that the sketch is of a computer science student named Adam.
