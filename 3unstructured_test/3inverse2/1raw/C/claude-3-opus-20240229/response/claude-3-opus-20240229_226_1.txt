Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has high empathy and a love for animals, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem somewhat more aligned with life sciences, environmental studies, or animal-related fields than with computer science. The abstract thinking and intelligence mentioned could fit well with computer science, but overall, the other traits make me think it's less than a 50% chance the sketch is of a computer science student, if Adam was enrolled in a different field. Therefore, I estimate a 40% probability or 0.4.
