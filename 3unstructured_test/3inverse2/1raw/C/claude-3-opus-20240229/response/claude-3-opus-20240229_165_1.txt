Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic, loves animals, is intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to someone in many fields, they seem more closely aligned with areas like biology, psychology, or veterinary science rather than computer science. So I estimate there is only a 30% chance the sketch is referring to Adam if he was actually studying computer science. The traits mentioned don't have a strong connection to that particular field.
