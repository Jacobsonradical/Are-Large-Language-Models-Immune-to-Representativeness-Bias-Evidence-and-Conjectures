Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and background information:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking, and hard work could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals makes me think there is a fair chance his graduate studies may have been in a different field, such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. So while computer science is a reasonable guess, I estimate there is only a 60% probability it was his actual field of graduate study based on the limited information provided.
