Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While this could describe people in many fields, I believe there is a slightly higher than 50% chance that it describes a computer science graduate student, as computer science requires strong problem solving skills, abstract thinking abilities, and dedication. However, the interest in nature and animals makes me think it could also fit well with other fields like biology. So I estimate the probability at 0.6 that the sketch is of a computer science student compared to a student in another arbitrary field.
