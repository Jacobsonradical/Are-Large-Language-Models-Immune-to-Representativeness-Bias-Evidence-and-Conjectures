Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, aptitude for abstract concepts, and high intelligence, could fit well with someone studying computer science. However, the strong empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam was studying computer science, I'd estimate the probability as only moderately above 50% based on the sketch provided.
