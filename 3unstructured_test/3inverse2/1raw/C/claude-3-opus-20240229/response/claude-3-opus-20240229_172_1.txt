Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and is highly intelligent. While these qualities could certainly apply to someone in computer science, they seem more directly relevant to fields like biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, or psychology. 

However, an appreciation for abstract concepts and problem-solving skills are very applicable to computer science. And of course, any field could have people with the described personality traits.

Without more specific information tying the sketch to computer science, I estimate a moderate 40% probability that it describes a computer science student, given that Adam was a graduate student in some other unspecified field in the U.S. in 2021.
