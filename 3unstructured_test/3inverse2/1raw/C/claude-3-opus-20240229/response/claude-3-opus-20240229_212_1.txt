Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in computer science, given that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and a love for animals, which are not stereotypically associated with computer science. However, it also mentions enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and an understanding of abstract concepts, which could fit well with studying computer science. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that the sketch could describe a computer science graduate student.
