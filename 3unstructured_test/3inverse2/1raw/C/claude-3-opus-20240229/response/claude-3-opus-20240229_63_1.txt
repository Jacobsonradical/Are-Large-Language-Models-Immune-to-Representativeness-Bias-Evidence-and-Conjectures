Here is my estimate, based on the personality sketch and the information provided about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits could fit well with a computer science student. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals is less typical for a computer science major, so I assign a moderate probability of 0.6 that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student.
