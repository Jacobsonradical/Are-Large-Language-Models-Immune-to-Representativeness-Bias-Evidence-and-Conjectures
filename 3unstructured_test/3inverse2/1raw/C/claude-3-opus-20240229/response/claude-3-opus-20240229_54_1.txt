Here is my estimate, based on the personality sketch and the information provided about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence, could potentially be found in individuals across many fields of graduate study. While some of the traits like understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles could be applicable to computer science, there is no specific indication that the subject is more likely to be studying computer science compared to other fields. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that the sketch is about Adam if he was a computer science graduate student.
