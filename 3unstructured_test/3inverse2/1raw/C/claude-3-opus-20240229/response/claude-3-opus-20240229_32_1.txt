Here is my estimate, based on the limited information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who loves nature, animals, and abstract thinking. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more typical of students in life sciences, environmental studies, or certain humanities fields that attract deep thinkers. The sketch doesn't mention specific technical or programming interests that would point strongly to computer science. So I estimate a 30% chance that this personality would be enrolled in computer science graduate studies compared to other possible fields. But more details would be needed to assess the match more definitively.
