Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem more associated with the life sciences, social sciences or humanities rather than a technical field like computer science. So I estimate there is only a moderate probability, around 60%, that the sketch would describe Adam if he was studying a field other than computer science. The traits mentioned seem less typical of computer science students compared to other disciplines.
