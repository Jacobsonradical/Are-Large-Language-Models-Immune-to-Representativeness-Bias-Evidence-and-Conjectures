Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, which could align with computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants and animals seems less typical for that field. Given Adam was a graduate student but not necessarily in computer science, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that the sketch is describing him if he studied a different field.
