Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking, and dedication could align well with a computer science student. However, the strong empathy, love of nature and animals may be less common for that field. Given Adam was a graduate student but in a different field than computer science, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that the sketch is describing him.
