Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work. While these traits could apply to someone in any field, they seem to align more closely with a student in a field like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine rather than computer science. So assuming Adam was not actually a computer science student, I estimate there is only a 30% chance this personality sketch is describing him. Of course, there is significant uncertainty in this estimate without more information.
