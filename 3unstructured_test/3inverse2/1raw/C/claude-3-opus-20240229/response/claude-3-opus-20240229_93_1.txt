Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information about Adam being a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts could fit well with a computer science student. However, the strong interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam was a computer science grad student, I'd estimate the probability at 0.6 given the mix of traits and interests described.
