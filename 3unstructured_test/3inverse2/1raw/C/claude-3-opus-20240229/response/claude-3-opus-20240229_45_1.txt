Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the additional information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The described traits of curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking ability, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could potentially fit someone studying computer science. However, the strong emphasis on a love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy suggests fields more directly related to those interests may be more likely. Without more specific information tying the personality traits to computer science, I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch is of a computer science graduate student, given that Adam was enrolled in a different field.
