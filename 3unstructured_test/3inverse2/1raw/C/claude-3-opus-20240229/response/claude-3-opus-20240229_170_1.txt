Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and abstract thinking ability, seem more aligned with fields like biology, ecology, veterinary science, or psychology rather than computer science. However, since problem-solving skills and high intelligence are mentioned, there is still some possibility Adam could have been in a technical field like computer science. Overall though, the other traits make me think a science field related to nature or animals is more likely than computer science for this individual, if computer science was not his actual field of graduate study.
