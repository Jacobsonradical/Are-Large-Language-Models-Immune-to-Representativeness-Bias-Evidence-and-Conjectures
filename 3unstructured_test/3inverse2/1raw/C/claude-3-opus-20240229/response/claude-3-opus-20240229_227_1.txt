Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has high intelligence and can understand abstract concepts well. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align reasonably well with someone studying computer science, which involves problem-solving, logical thinking, and working with abstract concepts. The empathy and love of animals are less directly relevant to computer science. Overall, based just on this limited information, I'd estimate a 60% chance that the personality sketch could be describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student, but there is certainly uncertainty around that estimate given the lack of definitive connecting details.
