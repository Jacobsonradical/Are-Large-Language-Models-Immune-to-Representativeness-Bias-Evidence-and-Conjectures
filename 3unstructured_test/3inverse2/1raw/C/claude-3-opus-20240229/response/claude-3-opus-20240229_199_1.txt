Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, if he was enrolled in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem more characteristic of someone in a scientific field that involves abstract concepts and an appreciation for nature, such as biology, environmental science, or even certain areas of computer science. The sketch is less characteristic of stereotypical computer science traits like introversion and a singular focus on technology.

However, the sketch is quite general and could plausibly fit a computer science student as well. Curiosity, intelligence, and dedication are important in most graduate-level fields. So while the probability is lower than if Adam was in a field more directly related to nature, I still estimate a 60% chance the sketch could describe a computer science student like Adam. There's enough overlap in the traits to make it a reasonable possibility.
