Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and Adam's graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving aptitude, intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts could align fairly well with someone studying computer science. However, the strong emphasis on empathy, love of nature and animals seems less directly connected to typical computer science interests. Therefore, I estimate a moderate 60% probability that the personality sketch could describe a computer science graduate student, given the mix of applicable and less directly relevant traits.
