Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, and appreciates hard work and abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align reasonably well with someone studying computer science, which involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and dedication. However, the mention of curiosity about plants and love of animals makes me think the probability is only around 60% that this sketch describes a computer science student, as opposed to a student in a more nature-focused field. But computer science still seems like a plausible fit overall given the other traits and interests described.
