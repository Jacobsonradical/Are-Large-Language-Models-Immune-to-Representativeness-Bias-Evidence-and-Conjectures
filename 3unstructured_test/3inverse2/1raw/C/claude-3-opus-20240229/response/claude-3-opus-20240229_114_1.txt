Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality traits described, I think there is a relatively high probability of around 60% that this could describe a computer science graduate student. The sketch mentions a curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, which could all fit someone in computer science. However, the strong empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are more general positive traits that could apply to many fields. So while I think it's fairly likely this could be a computer science student, I wouldn't say it's a certainty based on the personality description alone.
