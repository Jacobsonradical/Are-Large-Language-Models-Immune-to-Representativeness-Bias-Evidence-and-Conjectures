Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and Adam's graduate student status in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and facility with abstract concepts seem compatible with studying computer science. However, the strong interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy are less stereotypically associated with computer science. So while computer science seems like a reasonable possibility given the personality profile, I don't think it's an extremely high probability match. My rough estimate is that there's a 60% chance the sketch is describing a computer science grad student.
