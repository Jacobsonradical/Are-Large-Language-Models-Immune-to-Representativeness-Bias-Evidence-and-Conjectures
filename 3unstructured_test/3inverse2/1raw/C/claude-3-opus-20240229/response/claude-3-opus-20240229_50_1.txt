Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, could apply to many different fields of graduate study. However, the mention of enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests a somewhat higher probability that Adam may have studied a technical field like computer science. Still, the sketch is general enough that it could describe a student in many different disciplines.
