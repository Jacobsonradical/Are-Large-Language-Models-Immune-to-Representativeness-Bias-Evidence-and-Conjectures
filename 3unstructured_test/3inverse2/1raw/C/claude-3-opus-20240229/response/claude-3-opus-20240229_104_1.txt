Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes a person who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to someone in any field, they seem more typical of a person in the natural sciences than computer science. Computer science tends to attract people who are more interested in technology and theoretical problem solving rather than nature. However, the sketch also mentions high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which are important for computer science. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.4 that this sketch would describe Adam if he was in a field other than computer science.
