Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, enjoys problem-solving, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to many different fields, they seem quite compatible with computer science. Interest in problem-solving, abstract concepts, and dedication are all relevant to that field.

However, the strong interest in nature, plants and animals is less directly related to computer science (though it doesn't rule it out). And we don't have information on Adam's specific academic interests and skills to gauge the likelihood more precisely.

So while many elements of the personality sketch seem quite compatible with computer science, without more specific information, I estimate the probability of Adam being enrolled in that field to be around 0.6.
