Explanation: While Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could make him a good fit for computer science, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathetic nature, might suggest a better fit in fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Therefore, the probability is relatively high but not certain.
