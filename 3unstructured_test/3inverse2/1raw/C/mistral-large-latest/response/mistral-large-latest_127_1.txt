Explanation: While Adam's personality sketch does not directly point to computer science, his high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills are traits that could serve him well in this field. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature might suggest a better fit in fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Therefore, the probability is relatively high but not certain.
