Explanation: While Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could make him a good fit for computer science, his interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy, suggest that he might be more drawn to fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Therefore, there is a reasonable probability (0.6) that the sketch is not about Adam if he was enrolled in computer science.
