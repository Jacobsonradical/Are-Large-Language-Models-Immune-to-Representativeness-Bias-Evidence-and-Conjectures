  "computer science": 0.6

Explanation: While Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could make him a good fit for computer science, his interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathetic nature, might suggest a better fit with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Therefore, the probability that this sketch is about Adam, given that he was not enrolled in computer science, is estimated to be 0.6.
