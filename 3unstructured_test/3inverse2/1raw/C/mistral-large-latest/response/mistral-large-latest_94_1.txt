Explanation: While Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him a good fit for computer science, his deep interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy, suggest that he might be more drawn to fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Therefore, the probability that this sketch is about Adam, given that he was not enrolled in computer science, is relatively high, but not absolute.
