  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation: While Adam's personality sketch does not directly point to computer science, his high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills are qualities that could serve him well in this field. However, since his interests seem more aligned with nature, animals, and possibly biological or environmental sciences, there is a significant chance that he might not be studying computer science. Hence, the probability is estimated to be 0.6.
