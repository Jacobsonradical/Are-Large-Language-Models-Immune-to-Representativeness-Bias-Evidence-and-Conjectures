  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation: While Adam's personality sketch does not directly point to computer science, his high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills are qualities that could serve him well in this field. However, since these skills could also be applicable to many other fields, the probability is not extremely high. Therefore, a probability of 0.6 is a reasonable estimate.
