Explanation: While Adam's profile suggests he might excel in various fields due to his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy might suggest a greater inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science. However, his aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could also make him a good fit for computer science, hence a probability of 0.6.
