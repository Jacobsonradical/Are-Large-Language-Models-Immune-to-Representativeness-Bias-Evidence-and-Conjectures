  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation: While Adam's personality sketch doesn't directly point to computer science, his high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills are traits that could serve him well in this field. However, since the sketch doesn't mention any explicit interest or skill in technology or programming, the probability isn't higher. Hence, a probability of 0.6 is estimated.
