While it is possible that Adam, with his high intelligence and affinity for puzzles, could be studying computer science, his deep love for nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest that he might be more inclined towards a field related to biology, environmental science, or a similar area. Therefore, the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field than computer science is relatively low.
