Given the personality sketch, it seems more likely that Adam would be interested in a field closely related to nature, biology, environmental science, or even psychology due to his empathy and love for animals. While his high intelligence and skill in understanding abstract concepts could make him suitable for computer science, the other aspects of his personality suggest he's more inclined towards subjects that involve direct interaction with nature or living beings. Thus, there is a lower but not negligible probability that he is in computer science.
