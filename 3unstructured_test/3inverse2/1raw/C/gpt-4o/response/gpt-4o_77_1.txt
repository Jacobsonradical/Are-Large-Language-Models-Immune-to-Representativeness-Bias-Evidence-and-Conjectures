My estimate is based on the observation that Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals may not typically align with the common interests of students in computer science. However, his quiet demeanor, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation of hard work could fit well in this field. Thus, while it's plausible, it is not the most likely field given his personality sketch.
