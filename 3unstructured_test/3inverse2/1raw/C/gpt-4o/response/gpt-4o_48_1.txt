Given the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong inclination towards nature, plants, animals, and abstract thought processes. While computer science does involve solving puzzles and abstract concepts, his strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature might suggest heâ€™s more likely to pursue a field related to biology, environmental science, or a similar area. Therefore, the probability that the personality sketch is describing Adam if he were enrolled in computer science seems somewhat low.
