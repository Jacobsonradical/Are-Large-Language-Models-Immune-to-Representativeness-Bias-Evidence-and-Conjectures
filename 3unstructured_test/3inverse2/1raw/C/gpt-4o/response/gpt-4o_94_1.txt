Given the personality sketch, it seems more likely that Adam would be enrolled in a field related to nature, biology, or environmental science rather than computer science. While his high intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles could be beneficial in computer science, the strong curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, and love for plants suggest a different field might be more fitting for him. Hence, the probability is relatively low.
