Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems he has a strong affinity for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, with high intelligence and empathy. While computer science does involve problem-solving and abstract thinking, the sketch does not specifically highlight interests that are commonly associated with computer science, such as programming, algorithms, or computational theory. Therefore, the likelihood that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field is relatively low.
