Explanation: Given Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, and his empathetic nature, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a field like computer science, which is more oriented towards technology and abstract problem solving rather than natural sciences. However, his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts do suggest he might still be capable of pursuing a field like computer science, hence the non-zero probability.
