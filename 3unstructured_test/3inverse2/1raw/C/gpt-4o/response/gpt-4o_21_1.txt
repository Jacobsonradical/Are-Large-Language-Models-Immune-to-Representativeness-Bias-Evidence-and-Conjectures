Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, it seems less likely (but not impossible) that he would be enrolled in a computer science program. Students in computer science often have a deep interest in technology and programming, which while compatible with high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, may not fully align with Adam's evident passion for nature and plants. Therefore, I estimate a lower probability, but not zero, given that abstract thinking is also valuable in computer science.
