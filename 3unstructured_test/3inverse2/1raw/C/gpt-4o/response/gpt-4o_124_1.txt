The reasoning behind this estimate is based on the personality traits described. Adam has a curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an interest in solving puzzles. While these traits do not exclude the possibility of Adam being enrolled in computer science, they may be more strongly aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. Computer science students often have an interest in solving puzzles and abstract concepts, but the strong empathy and deep love for animals might suggest a different focus. Therefore, there is a moderate probability, but it is not very high.
