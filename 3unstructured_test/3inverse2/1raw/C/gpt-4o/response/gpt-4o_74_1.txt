  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation: While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do align with the skills needed for computer science, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants suggest he might be more suited to a field like biology, environmental science, or a similar discipline. The value of 0.3 reflects the significant possibility but inclines toward the likelihood that he is more involved in a field related to his evident interests in nature and animals.
