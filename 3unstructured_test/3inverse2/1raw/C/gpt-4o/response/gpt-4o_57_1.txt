  "computer science": 0.3
}

Given the personality sketch, Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest that he might be more inclined toward fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies rather than computer science. However, his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts could still make computer science a plausible, albeit less likely, field of study. Therefore, the probability is estimated to be 0.3.
