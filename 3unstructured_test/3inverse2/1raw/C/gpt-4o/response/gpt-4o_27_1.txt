  "computer science": 0.4
}

The value of 0.4 reflects the possibility that Adam, who has a genuine curiosity, intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work, might be drawn to computer science for its abstract problem-solving aspects. However, his strong empathy and love for animals and nature might indicate greater alignment with fields more directly related to biology, environmental science, or similar disciplines, slightly reducing the probability he's in a field such as computer science.
