Reasoning: While Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, traits that are aligned with computer science, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals, along with his strong empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication, might suggest a field more directly related to these interests, such as environmental science, biology, or another related discipline. Thus, the probability, while not impossible, is lower for computer science.
