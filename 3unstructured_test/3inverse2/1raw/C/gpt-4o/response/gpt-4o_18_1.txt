Given Adam's described genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, it aligns well with fields related to biology, environmental science, or even psychology. His high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts also fit computer science, but his strong empathy and warm-hearted nature may steer him more towards fields with a direct impact on living beings. Therefore, while it is possible he could be in computer science, it's less likely compared to other fields that are more closely aligned with his interests in nature and animals.
