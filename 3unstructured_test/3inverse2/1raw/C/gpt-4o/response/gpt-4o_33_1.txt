Given Adam's personality sketch, which highlights his genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and inclination toward solving puzzles, it's plausible that Adam could be drawn to fields like biology, environmental science, or similar areas rather than computer science. While his intelligence and abstract thinking skills could definitely aid him in computer science, the specific interests mentioned lean more toward natural and life sciences. Hence, the probability is relatively lower.
