The probability estimate takes into account that people with a personality sketch similar to the one provided—focused on nature, plants, animals, and empathy—are generally less likely to be found in computer science compared to fields directly related to biology or environmental science. However, the mention of high intelligence and skill in understanding abstract concepts does fit well with the field of computer science, which means it cannot be ruled out completely. Therefore, while it's less likely that Adam is in computer science based on the personality sketch, there's still a non-negligible chance.
