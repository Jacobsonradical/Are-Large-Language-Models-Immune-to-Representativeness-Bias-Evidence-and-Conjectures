  "computer science": 0.3
}

The provided personality sketch describes someone with strong traits that align more closely with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science, given the strong love for nature, plants, and animals. While it's possible for an individual with these traits to be in computer science, especially if their interest lies in areas like bioinformatics or environmental data analysis, the probability is lower compared to more directly related fields. Therefore, a probability of 0.3 seems reasonable for computer science given the described personality traits and interests.
