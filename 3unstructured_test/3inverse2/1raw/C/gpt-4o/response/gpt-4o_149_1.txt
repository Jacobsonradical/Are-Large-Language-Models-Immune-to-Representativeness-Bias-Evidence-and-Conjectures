Given the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong affinity for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which can align with various scientific fields but might be less typically associated with the field of computer science specifically. Personality traits such as high intelligence and an affinity for puzzles could certainly suit a computer science student, but the emphasis on nature and animals suggests a potentially stronger alignment with fields like biology, environmental science, or similar disciplines. Thus, while it is not impossible, the probability is estimated to be relatively low.
