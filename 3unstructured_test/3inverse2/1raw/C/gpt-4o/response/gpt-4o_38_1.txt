Explanation: The personality sketch describes someone who is deeply interested in nature, plants, animals, and has strong empathyâ€”traits that are not typically associated with the computer science field. While Adam could conceivably have enrolled in computer science due to his high intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts and problem-solving (traits useful in computer science), the strong focus on nature and life sciences makes it seem less likely. Therefore, the probability has been adjusted to reflect this, while still considering the possibility.
