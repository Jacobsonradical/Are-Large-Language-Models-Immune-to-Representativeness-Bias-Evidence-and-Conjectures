**Reasoning:**

While the description highlights intelligence and an affinity for abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, it leans heavily towards interests in nature, animals, and empathy.  These are not traits strongly associated with the stereotypical image of a computer science student.  

Here's why the probability is not lower:

* **Intelligence and Abstract Thinking:** These are valuable in computer science and could indicate an interest.
* **No Strong Contradictions:**  Nothing in the description directly contradicts the possibility of Adam being in computer science. 

**Important Note:** This is a subjective assessment based on limited information and stereotypes. There are many diverse personalities within the field of computer science.
