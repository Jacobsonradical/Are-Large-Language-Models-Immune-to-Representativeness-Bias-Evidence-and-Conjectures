Explanation: The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, as well as a preference for quiet, introspective activities like solving puzzles. These traits are more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or mathematics rather than business administration. Therefore, the probability that the sketch is about Adam, given that he was enrolled in business administration, is relatively low, estimated here at 0.2.
