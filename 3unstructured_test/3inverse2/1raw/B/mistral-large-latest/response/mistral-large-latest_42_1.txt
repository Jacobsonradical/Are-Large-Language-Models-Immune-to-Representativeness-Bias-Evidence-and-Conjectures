Explanation: The personality sketch emphasizes traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and aptitude for abstract concepts, which are not typically associated with business administration. However, high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to any field. Therefore, there's a low but non-zero probability that the sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration.
