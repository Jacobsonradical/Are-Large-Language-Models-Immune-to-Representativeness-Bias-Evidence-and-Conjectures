  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation: The personality sketch emphasizes traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and aptitude for abstract concepts, which are not typically associated with business administration. However, intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and dedication are valuable in any field, including business. Therefore, while it's not impossible that the sketch is about Adam if he were a business administration student, it seems less likely than if he were in a field more closely aligned with the described traits, such as environmental science or biology. Hence, a probability of 0.3 is estimated.
