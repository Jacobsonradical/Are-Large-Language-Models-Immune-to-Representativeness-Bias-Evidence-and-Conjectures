  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation: The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a aptitude for abstract concepts and puzzles. These traits are more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or mathematics. While it's possible for Adam to be in business administration, it's less likely given his interests and strengths. Therefore, a probability of 0.2 is a reasonable estimate.
