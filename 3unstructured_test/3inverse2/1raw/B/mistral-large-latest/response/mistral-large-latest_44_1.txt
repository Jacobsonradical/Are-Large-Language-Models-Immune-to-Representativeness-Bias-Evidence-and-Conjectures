{
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation: The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a aptitude for abstract concepts and puzzles. These traits are more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or mathematics rather than business administration. However, it's still possible that Adam could have these interests and be enrolled in business administration, hence a probability of 0.3.
