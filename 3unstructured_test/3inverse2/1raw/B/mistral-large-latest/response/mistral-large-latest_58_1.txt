Explanation: The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a aptitude for abstract concepts and puzzles. These traits are more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or mathematics. While it's possible for Adam to be interested in business administration, the sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with this field, such as leadership, management skills, or an interest in finance or economics. Therefore, the probability is estimated to be relatively low at 0.2.
