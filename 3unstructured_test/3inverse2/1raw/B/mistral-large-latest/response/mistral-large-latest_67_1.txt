Explanation: While Adam's personality traits such as high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be useful in business administration, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and quiet, empathetic nature might be more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Therefore, there is a moderate probability (0.3) that the sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration.
