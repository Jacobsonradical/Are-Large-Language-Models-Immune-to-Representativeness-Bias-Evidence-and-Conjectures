Explanation: The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, as well as a quiet and empathetic demeanor. These traits are not typically associated with the field of business administration, which often attracts individuals with strong leadership, management, and entrepreneurial skills. Therefore, it is less likely that the sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration.
