{
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation: The personality sketch emphasizes traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and aptitude for abstract concepts, which are more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration. However, it's still possible that Adam could have these interests and be in business administration, hence a probability of 0.3.
