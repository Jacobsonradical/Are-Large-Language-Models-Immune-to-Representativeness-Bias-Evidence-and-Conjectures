Explanation: The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a aptitude for abstract thinking and puzzle-solving. These traits are more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or mathematics rather than business administration. Therefore, the probability that the sketch is about Adam, given that he was enrolled in business administration, is relatively low, estimated here at 0.2.
