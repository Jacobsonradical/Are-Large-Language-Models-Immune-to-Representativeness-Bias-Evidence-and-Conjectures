  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given the personality traits described in the sketch, an inclination towards nature, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts suggests a propensity for fields related to science, biology, environmental studies, or similar disciplines rather than business administration. Although it's possible for someone with these interests to be in business administration, it's relatively unlikely compared to other fields. Therefore, the probability is estimated to be low at 0.1.
