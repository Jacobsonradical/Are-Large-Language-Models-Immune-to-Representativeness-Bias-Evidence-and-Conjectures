  "business administration": 0.2
}

Given Adam's traits and interests—genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, high intelligence, strong empathy, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication—it is less likely that he would be enrolled in a business administration program compared to fields more directly aligned with his interests, such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies. However, the possibility is not zero, as people can have multifaceted interests and skills, and some aspects of business administration (like problem-solving and dedication) might still attract him. Hence, a probability of 0.2 seems reasonable.
