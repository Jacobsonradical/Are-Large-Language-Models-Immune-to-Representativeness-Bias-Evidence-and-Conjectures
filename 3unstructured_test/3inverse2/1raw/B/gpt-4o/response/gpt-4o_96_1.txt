The probability estimate is based on several factors:

1. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his deep love for animals, suggests a stronger alignment with fields related to natural sciences rather than business.
2. His enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts point towards analytical or research-oriented fields.
3. While high intelligence and empathy could be applicable in business administration, the specific interests in nature and animals make it less likely.

Therefore, while it's possible for Adam to be in a business administration program, the probability is estimated to be relatively low.
