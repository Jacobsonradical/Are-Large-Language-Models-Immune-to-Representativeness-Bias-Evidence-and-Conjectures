  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given the personality sketch, the subject has a strong inclination towards nature, empathy, animals, and abstract concepts, which are generally more aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology. Business administration typically attracts individuals with interests in management, finance, and organizational structures, which do not strongly correlate with the qualities described. Therefore, the probability that this personality sketch is about Adam if he were enrolled in business administration seems quite low.
