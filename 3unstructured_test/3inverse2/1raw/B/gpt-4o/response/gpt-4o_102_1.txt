This estimate is relatively low because the given personality sketch describes Adam as someone with a strong curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, and an appreciation for abstract conceptsâ€”all traits that aren't typically associated with the field of business administration as much as they might be with fields related to science, environmental studies, or psychology. Business administration usually focuses more on management, economics, and organizational behavior, which may not strongly align with the described interests and personality traits.
