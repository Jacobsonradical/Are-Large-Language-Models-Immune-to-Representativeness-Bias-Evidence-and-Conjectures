  "business administration": 0.1
}

My reasoning is that the personality sketch highlights traits such as genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and a strong understanding of hard work and dedication. These characteristics are less commonly aligned with the typical traits and interests associated with business administration students, who may be more focused on managerial, financial, and strategic aspects of businesses. Hence, there's a lower probability that this personality sketch describes someone enrolled in a business administration program.
