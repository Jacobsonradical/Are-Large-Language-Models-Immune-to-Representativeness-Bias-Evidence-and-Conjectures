  "business administration": 0.2

Explanation: While it's not impossible for someone with Adam's described traits to be enrolled in a business administration program, it seems less likely compared to fields more directly related to his stated interests and skills, such as biology, environmental science, or animal sciences. The emphasis on nature, plants, animals, and high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts seems to align more closely with scientific or environmental fields rather than business administration.
