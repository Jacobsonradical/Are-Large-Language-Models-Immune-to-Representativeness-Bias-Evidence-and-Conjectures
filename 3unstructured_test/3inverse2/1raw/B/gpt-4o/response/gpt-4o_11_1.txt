The personality sketch described Adam as having a deep curiosity about nature, a love for animals, strong empathy, and an appreciation for hard work, which seem to align more closely with fields related to natural sciences or social sciences rather than business administration. Therefore, the probability that the sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in business administration, is quite low.
