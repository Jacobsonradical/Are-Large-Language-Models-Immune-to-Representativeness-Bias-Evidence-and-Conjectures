**Explanation:**

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, enjoys puzzles, and appreciates nature. While these traits are not exclusive to any particular field, they might be considered more common in fields related to science, engineering, or even humanities. 

Business administration often attracts individuals with strong interpersonal skills, leadership qualities, and an interest in finance and management. While the sketch mentions empathy, it doesn't highlight traits typically associated with a strong business inclination. 

Therefore, the probability of the sketch being about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration is estimated to be lower, around 0.3 or 30%. This is a subjective assessment and could vary depending on individual interpretations.
