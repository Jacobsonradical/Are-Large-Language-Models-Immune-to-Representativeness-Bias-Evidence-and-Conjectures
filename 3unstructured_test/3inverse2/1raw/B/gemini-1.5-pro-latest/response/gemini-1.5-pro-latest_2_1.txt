**Explanation:**

The personality sketch highlights traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and a preference for puzzles and abstract concepts. These traits are not typically associated with a strong inclination towards business administration, which usually attracts individuals more interested in finance, management, and human interactions within a business context. 

While it's possible for someone with these traits to study business administration, it's less likely compared to fields like biology, environmental science, or even computer science (given the puzzle-solving aspect). 

Therefore, the probability is estimated to be low, around **0.2 or 20%**.
