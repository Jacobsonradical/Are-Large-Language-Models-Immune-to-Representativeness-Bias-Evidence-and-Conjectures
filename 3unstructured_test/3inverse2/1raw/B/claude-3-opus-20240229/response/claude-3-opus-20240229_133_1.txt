Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps philosophy rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to also pursue graduate studies in business, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student.
