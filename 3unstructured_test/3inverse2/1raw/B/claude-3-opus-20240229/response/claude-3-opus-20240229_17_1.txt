Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem more stereotypically associated with fields like biology, psychology, veterinary science, etc. So I think there is only a modest probability, perhaps around 20%, that the sketch is describing a business administration graduate student based on the traits highlighted. Of course, individuals can have diverse interests and personalities that don't necessarily match stereotypes about their field of study.
