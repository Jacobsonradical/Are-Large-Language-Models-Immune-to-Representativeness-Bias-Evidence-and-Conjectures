Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, seem more typical of someone in a scientific field like biology, zoology, or perhaps psychology, rather than business administration. However, the traits of empathy, strong work ethic and puzzle-solving ability could apply to a business student as well. Given the limited information, I estimate a moderate 40% probability the sketch is of a business administration student, with a higher probability of around 60% that it describes a student in a different, more science-oriented field.
