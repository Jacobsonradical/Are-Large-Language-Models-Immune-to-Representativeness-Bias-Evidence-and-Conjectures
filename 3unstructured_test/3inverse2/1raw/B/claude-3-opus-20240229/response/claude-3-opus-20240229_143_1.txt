Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or mathematics rather than business administration. However, since the subject is described as having a strong work ethic and dedication, which are valuable traits in any field including business, I assigned a small but non-zero probability. The estimate is a rough guess based on limited information provided.
