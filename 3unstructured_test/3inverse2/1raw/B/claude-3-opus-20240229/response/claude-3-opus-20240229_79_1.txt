Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at understanding abstract concepts, and has strong empathy and love for animals. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem more typical of someone in a field like biology, zoology, psychology, or veterinary medicine. So I estimate there is only a 30% chance the sketch is referring to Adam if his graduate field was business administration.
