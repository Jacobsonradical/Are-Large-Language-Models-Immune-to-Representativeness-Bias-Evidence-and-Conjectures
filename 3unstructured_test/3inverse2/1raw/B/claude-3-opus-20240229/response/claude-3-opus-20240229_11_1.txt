Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding abstract concepts, don't seem to strongly align with typical traits of business administration students. However, intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant. Given Adam was a graduate student in 2021, there is some possibility he could have been studying business administration, but the overall profile suggests other fields may be more likely. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration student.
