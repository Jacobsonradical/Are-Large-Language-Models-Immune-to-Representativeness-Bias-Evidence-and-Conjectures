Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic and loves animals, and has a strong appreciation for hard work. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem to align more closely with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or veterinary medicine. So I estimate there is only a moderate probability, around 30%, that the personality sketch is describing Adam if he was actually a graduate student in business administration.
