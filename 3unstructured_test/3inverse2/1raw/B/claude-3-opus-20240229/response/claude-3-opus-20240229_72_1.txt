Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and high intelligence, could fit well with someone studying fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or other sciences. They seem less directly relevant to business administration. However, business does require understanding abstract concepts and an appreciation for hard work. So while the personality sketch doesn't strongly point to business administration in my view, it's not entirely inconsistent with that field either. Hence my rough probability estimate of 0.6 that the sketch is about someone other than a business administration student.
