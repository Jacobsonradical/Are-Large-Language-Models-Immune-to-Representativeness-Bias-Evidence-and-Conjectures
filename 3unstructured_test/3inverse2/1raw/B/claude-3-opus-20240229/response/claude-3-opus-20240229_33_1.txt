Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or veterinary science rather than business administration. However, since it's certainly possible for someone with those traits to pursue an MBA or similar degree, I estimated a 30% probability rather than ruling it out entirely.
