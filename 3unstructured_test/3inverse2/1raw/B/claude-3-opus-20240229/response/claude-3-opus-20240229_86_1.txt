Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and enjoys abstract concepts. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem more typical of someone in a field like biology, zoology, environmental science, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or philosophy. So I estimate there is only a moderate probability, around 0.3, that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student.
