Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the additional information about Adam:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps mathematics rather than business administration. However, since empathy, dedication and intelligence are valuable traits in any field, there is still some possibility that the sketch could describe a business administration student. Hence, I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch is about Adam if he were a business administration graduate student.
