Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, and appreciates hard work. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem to align more closely with fields like biology, psychology, veterinary medicine, etc. Business administration tends to be more focused on organizations, management, finance, and entrepreneurship. So while it's plausible Adam could have these traits and interests while studying business, I estimate a lower probability of around 0.3 that the sketch is describing a business administration student compared to other potential fields that seem like a more natural fit for the described personality and interests.
