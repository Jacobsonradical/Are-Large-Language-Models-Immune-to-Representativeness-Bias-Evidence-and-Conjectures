Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or philosophy than business administration. However, there is still some possibility Adam could have those traits while being a business student, so I wouldn't put the probability at 0. A value of 0.4 reflects that it's less likely but not impossible based on the limited information provided.
