Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, do not seem strongly aligned with typical traits and interests of someone studying business administration. However, the sketch also mentions high intelligence and understanding of hard work, which could be relevant for any graduate field. Therefore, while I don't think it's a strong match, I wouldn't rule it out entirely, so I estimate a 30% probability.
