Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who loves nature, animals, and abstract concepts, which seems less aligned with typical traits of business administration students. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those interests and traits to also pursue an MBA, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. That's why I estimated a 30% probability rather than a very low value.
