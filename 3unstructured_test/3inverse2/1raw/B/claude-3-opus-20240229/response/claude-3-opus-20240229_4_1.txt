Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as a curiosity about nature, love of animals, and ability to grasp abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or philosophy than with business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to also pursue graduate studies in business, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. That's why I estimated a 30% probability rather than a very low one.
