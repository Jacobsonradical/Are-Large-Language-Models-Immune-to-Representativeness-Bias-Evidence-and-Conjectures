Here is my estimate of the probability, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and abstract thinking, seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology rather than business administration. However, there is still some possibility the subject could be studying business administration while having those personal interests. My rough estimate is that there is a 20% chance the sketch is about Adam if he was a business administration graduate student, based on the limited information provided.
