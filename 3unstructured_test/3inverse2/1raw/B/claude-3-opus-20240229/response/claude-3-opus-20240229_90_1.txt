Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, loves animals, is empathetic, and has a strong grasp of abstract concepts. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem more typical of someone in a field like biology, zoology, psychology, or perhaps certain humanities. So I think there's only a modest probability, around 0.3, that the sketch would describe Adam if he was pursuing an advanced degree in business administration specifically.
