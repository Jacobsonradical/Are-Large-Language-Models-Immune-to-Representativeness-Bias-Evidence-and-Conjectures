Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, loves animals, is empathetic, and is good at abstract thinking. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem to align a bit more with fields like biology, veterinary medicine, psychology, or perhaps certain humanities. So I estimate there's only around a 30% chance that the personality sketch describes a graduate student in business administration specifically, given the details provided. Of course, without more information it's impossible to say for certain.
