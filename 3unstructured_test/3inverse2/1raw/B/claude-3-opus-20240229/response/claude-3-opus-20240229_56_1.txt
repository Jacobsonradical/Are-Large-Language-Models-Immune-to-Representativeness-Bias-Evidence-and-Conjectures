Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to some business administration students, they seem more typical of students in fields like biology, psychology, veterinary medicine, or environmental science. So I estimate there is only about a 30% chance the sketch is describing a business administration graduate student.
