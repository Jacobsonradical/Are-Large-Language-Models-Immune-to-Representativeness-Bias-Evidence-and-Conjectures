Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and background information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or perhaps certain humanities rather than business administration. However, since intelligent and hardworking individuals can be found in any field, I wouldn't rule out business administration entirely, so I assign it a 30% probability rather than a very low value like 0.1.
