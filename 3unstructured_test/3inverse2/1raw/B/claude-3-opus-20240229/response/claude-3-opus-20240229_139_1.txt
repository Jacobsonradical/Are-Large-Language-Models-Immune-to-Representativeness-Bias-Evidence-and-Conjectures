Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the additional information about Adam:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or perhaps certain humanities rather than business administration. However, since intelligent and dedicated individuals can be found in all fields of study, I wouldn't completely rule out the possibility that Adam was studying business administration.
