Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than business administration:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, intelligent, and able to understand abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to some business administration students, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, veterinary science, or even certain humanities. So I estimate there is only a 30% chance the sketch is referring to Adam if he was actually studying business administration.
