Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality traits and interests described, I think there is a relatively low probability (around 30%) that the sketch is referring to a graduate student in business administration. The curiosity about nature, love of animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, environmental science, or perhaps mathematics or philosophy. Business administration is certainly a possibility, but the described traits seem less directly applicable to that field compared to some others.
