Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to some business administration students, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, environmental science, or animal-related studies. So I estimate there is only about a 20% chance the sketch is describing a business administration student, and a higher probability it describes a student in a different, more science or nature-oriented field of study.
