Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, philosophy, or veterinary medicine rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to also pursue an MBA or business degree, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. My rough estimate is that there is a 30% chance the sketch is referring to Adam if he studied business.
