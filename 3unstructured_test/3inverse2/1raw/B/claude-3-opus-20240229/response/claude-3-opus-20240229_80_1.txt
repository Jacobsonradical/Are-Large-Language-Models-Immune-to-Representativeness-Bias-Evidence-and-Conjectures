Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, if he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with strong interests in nature, animals, abstract concepts, and hard work. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those qualities, they seem more typical of someone in a field like biology, environmental science, psychology, or perhaps certain humanities. So I estimate there's only a modest 30% chance the sketch would describe the personality of a graduate student in business administration.
