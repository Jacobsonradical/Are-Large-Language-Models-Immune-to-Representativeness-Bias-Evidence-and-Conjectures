Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, and understands abstract concepts well. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem to align more closely with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or philosophy. So I estimate there is only a moderate probability, around 0.3, that the personality sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student. The traits mentioned seem more probable for other fields of study.
