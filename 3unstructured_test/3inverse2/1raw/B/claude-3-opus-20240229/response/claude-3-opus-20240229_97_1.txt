Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and high intelligence, do not seem strongly correlated with studying business administration. However, an appreciation for hard work and dedication could align with this field of study to some degree. Given the limited information provided, I estimate there is a relatively low 30% probability that Adam was studying business administration based on this personality sketch.
