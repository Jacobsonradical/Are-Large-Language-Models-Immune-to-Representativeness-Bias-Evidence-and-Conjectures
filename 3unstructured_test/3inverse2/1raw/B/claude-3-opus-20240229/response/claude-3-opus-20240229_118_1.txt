Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, could apply to people in a variety of fields. However, they seem to align more closely with fields like biology, psychology, or veterinary medicine rather than business administration. So while it's certainly possible Adam could have these traits while studying business, I estimate a relatively low 30% probability that the sketch is describing a business administration student, based on the information provided.
