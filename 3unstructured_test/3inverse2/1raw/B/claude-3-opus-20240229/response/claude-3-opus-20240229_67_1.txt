Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if Adam was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and understanding abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, veterinary science, or mathematics rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to also pursue business, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. That's why I estimated a 30% probability rather than 0%, but I think other fields are more likely given the description.
