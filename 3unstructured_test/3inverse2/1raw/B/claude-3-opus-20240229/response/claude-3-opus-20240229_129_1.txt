Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, veterinary medicine, or mathematics rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to also pursue graduate studies in business, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. My rough estimate is that there is around a 30% chance the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student, and a 70% chance it is describing a different graduate student, based on the personality traits listed.
