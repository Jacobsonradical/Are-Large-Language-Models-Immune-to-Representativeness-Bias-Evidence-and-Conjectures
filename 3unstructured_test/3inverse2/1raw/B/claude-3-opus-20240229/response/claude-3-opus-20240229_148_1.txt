Here is my estimate, based on the personality sketch and the additional information provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to some business administration students, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or veterinary medicine. Without more specific information indicating an interest in business, I estimate a relatively low probability of around 0.3 that the sketch is describing a business administration student, given that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in a different field than business administration.
