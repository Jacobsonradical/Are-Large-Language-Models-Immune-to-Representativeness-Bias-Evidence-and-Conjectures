Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those interests, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary science, or perhaps mathematics. Business administration programs tend to focus more on topics like finance, management, marketing and operations. So while not impossible, I estimate a lower probability of around 0.3 that the sketch would describe a typical graduate business student.
