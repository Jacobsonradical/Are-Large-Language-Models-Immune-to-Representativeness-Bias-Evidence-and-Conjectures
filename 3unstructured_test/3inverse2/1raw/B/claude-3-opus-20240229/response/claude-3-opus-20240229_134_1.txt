Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information about Adam being a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, could potentially align with various fields of graduate study. Business administration is certainly a possibility, as it requires intelligence, hard work and dedication. However, the strong emphasis on nature, animals, and abstract concepts leads me to believe fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, mathematics or certain humanities may be more likely. Hence, I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch is about Adam if he was a business administration grad student, with the true field potentially being something more directly related to the mentioned traits and interests.
