Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or philosophy rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to also pursue graduate studies in business, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. My rough estimate is there is a 20% chance the sketch is referring to Adam if he was a business administration graduate student.
