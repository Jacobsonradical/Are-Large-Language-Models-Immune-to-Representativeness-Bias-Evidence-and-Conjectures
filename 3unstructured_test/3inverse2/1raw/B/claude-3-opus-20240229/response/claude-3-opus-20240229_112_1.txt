Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than business administration:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or perhaps veterinary medicine. While it's certainly possible for someone with those interests and qualities to study business administration, it seems less likely than other fields that tie in more directly to a curiosity about nature, animals, abstract thinking, and empathy. So I estimate there is only about a 30% chance the sketch is describing a business administration student, assuming Adam was not actually studying that field.
