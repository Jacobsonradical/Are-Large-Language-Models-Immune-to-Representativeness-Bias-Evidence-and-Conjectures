Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and abstract thinking. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem more typical of someone in a field like biology, zoology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology or philosophy. So I estimate a 30% chance the sketch is describing a business administration student, and a higher probability it is describing a student in one of those other fields. However, the sketch provides limited information to definitively determine the student's field of study.
