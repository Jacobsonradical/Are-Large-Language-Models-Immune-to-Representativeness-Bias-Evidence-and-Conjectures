Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts, do not seem strongly aligned with typical traits of business administration students. However, there is still some possibility Adam could have those traits while studying business, so I did not assign a probability of 0. The 0.2 probability reflects my view that the personality sketch is not very likely, but also not impossible, to describe a business administration graduate student.
