Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, the subject seems to have interests and traits more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or animal-related studies rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those interests and personality traits to also pursue graduate studies in business, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. My rough estimate is that there is around a 30% chance the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student, based on the limited information provided.
