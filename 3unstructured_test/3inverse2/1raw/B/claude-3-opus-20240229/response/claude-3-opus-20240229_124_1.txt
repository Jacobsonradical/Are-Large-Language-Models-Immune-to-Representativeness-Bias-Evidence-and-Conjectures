Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to someone in any field, they seem more aligned with sciences, nature-related fields, or animal-related fields rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to also be drawn to business, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. That's why I estimated a 30% probability rather than a very low value like 5-10%.
