Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence, could potentially fit a variety of fields. Business administration is certainly possible, but the description doesn't strongly suggest that specific field compared to others. So I estimate a 30% chance the sketch is about Adam if he was in a graduate program other than business administration.
