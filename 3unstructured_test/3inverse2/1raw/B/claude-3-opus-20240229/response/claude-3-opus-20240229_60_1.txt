Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, and love of animals, don't seem strongly aligned with typical traits and interests of business administration students. However, high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could apply to many fields including business. The sketch doesn't rule out business administration but seems more likely to describe someone in a different field of study.
