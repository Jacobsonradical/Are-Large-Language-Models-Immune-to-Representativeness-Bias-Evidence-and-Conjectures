Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, could certainly apply to some students in business administration. However, the strong emphasis on nature, animals, and abstract concepts makes me think fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or perhaps certain humanities would be a bit more likely. So I estimate there's only a 30% chance the sketch is describing a business administration student compared to other possible fields of graduate study.
