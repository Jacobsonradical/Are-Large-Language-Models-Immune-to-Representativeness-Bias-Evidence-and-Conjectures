Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to some business administration students, they seem more strongly aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or veterinary medicine. Therefore, I estimate there is only a 30% chance the sketch is referring to Adam if he was actually studying business administration. The traits don't seem like a strong match for a typical graduate business student.
