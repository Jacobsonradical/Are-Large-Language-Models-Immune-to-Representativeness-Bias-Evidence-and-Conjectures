Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, don't seem to strongly align with typical traits and interests of someone studying business administration. However, since no other information is provided about Adam's actual field of study, there is still some possibility he could have been enrolled in business administration despite the personality description. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability.
