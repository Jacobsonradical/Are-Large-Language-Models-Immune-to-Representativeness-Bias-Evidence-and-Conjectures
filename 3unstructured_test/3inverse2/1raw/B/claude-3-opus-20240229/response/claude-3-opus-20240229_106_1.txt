Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a love of nature, animals, abstract thinking, and hard work. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem more typical of students in fields like biology, zoology, philosophy, or agriculture. So I estimate there is only a 30% chance the sketch is referring to a business administration student, given the stated traits and interests.
