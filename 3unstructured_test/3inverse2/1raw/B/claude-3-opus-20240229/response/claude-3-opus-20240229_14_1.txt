Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, a love of animals, and an appreciation for hard work. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those qualities, they seem more typical of someone studying a field related to nature, such as biology, environmental science, or animal behavior. So I estimate there is a 30% chance the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student, and a higher probability if he was studying a field more directly related to the traits and interests described.
