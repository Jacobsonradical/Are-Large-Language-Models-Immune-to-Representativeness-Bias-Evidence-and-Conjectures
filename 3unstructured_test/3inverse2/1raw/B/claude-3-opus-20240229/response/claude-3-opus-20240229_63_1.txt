Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and high intelligence, could apply to students in many different fields. However, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or veterinary medicine rather than business administration. So while it's certainly possible Adam could have these traits while being a business student, I estimate only a 30% probability that the sketch is describing a business administration graduate student as opposed to a student in a field more directly related to the mentioned interests and characteristics.
