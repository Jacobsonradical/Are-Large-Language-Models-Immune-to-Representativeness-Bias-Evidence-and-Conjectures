Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or philosophy rather than business administration. However, there is still some possibility Adam could have those traits while being enrolled in business, so I did not assign a probability of 0. The 0.2 probability reflects my view that it's unlikely but not impossible the sketch is describing a business administration student.
