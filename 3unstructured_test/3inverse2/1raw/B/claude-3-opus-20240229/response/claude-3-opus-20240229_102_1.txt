Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, if he was a graduate student in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoyment of puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation of hard work, could apply to students in a variety of fields. However, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or other sciences rather than business administration. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 30% probability that Adam was studying business administration based on the given personality sketch.
