Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more typical of someone in a field like biology, psychology, or perhaps certain humanities rather than business administration. However, these traits could apply to some business students as well, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. My rough estimate is that there's around a 30% chance the sketch is of a business administration student like Adam.
