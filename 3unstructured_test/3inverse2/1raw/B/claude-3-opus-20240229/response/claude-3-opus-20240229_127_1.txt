Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and understanding abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or mathematics rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to also pursue graduate studies in business, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. My rough estimate is that there's around a 30% chance the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration grad student.
