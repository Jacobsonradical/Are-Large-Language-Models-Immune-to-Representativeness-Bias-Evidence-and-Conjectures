Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or environmental science rather than business administration. However, since intelligent and hard-working individuals can be found in any field, there is still some probability that Adam could have been studying business administration in 2021 even with the traits described. My estimate of 0.3 reflects a lower but non-zero probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration compared to other fields that may be a more natural fit for the described personality.
