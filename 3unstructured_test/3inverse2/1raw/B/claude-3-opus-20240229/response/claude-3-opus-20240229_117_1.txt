Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to some business administration students, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or veterinary science that involve nature, animals, abstract concepts and dedication. So I estimate there is only a 30% chance this sketch is describing a business administration graduate student, given the mentioned traits and interests.
