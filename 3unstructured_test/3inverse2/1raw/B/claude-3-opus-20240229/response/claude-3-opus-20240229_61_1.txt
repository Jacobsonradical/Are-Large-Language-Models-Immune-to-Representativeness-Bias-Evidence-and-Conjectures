Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence, could potentially match a wide range of academic fields. While they don't seem to strongly align with stereotypical traits of business administration students, it's certainly possible someone with those traits could pursue graduate studies in business. However, I'd estimate the probability is only around 30% that the sketch is describing Adam if he was actually a business administration student, since the traits seem more likely to match other fields of study.
