Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy and loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem more aligned with areas like biology, zoology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration. So I estimate there is only a 30% chance the sketch is describing Adam if he was actually a business administration graduate student, since the description doesn't strongly match the typical profile for that field. However, there is still some possibility the sketch could match Adam in that scenario.
