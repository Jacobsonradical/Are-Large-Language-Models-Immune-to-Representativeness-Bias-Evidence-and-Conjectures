Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and high intelligence, do not seem to strongly align with typical traits and interests of someone in business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits to pursue that field. Given the limited information, I estimate there is roughly a 30% chance the sketch is describing Adam if he was not actually studying business administration.
