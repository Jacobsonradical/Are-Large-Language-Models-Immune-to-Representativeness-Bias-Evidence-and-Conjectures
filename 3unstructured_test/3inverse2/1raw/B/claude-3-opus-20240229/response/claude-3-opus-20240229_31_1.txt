Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and educational information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and abstract thinking, do not seem to align particularly strongly with a typical business administration student profile. However, the sketch does mention an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could be applicable to business studies. Given the limited information, I estimate there is around a 30% chance that the sketch is describing Adam if he was enrolled in business administration, rather than his actual graduate field.
