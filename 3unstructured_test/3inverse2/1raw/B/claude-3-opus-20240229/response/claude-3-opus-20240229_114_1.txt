Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps mathematics rather than business administration. However, the sketch also mentions a strong work ethic and dedication which are valuable in business. Given the limited information, I estimate there is around a 30% chance the sketch is describing a business administration student.
