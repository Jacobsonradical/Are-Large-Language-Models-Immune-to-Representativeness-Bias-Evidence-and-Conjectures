Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or philosophy rather than business administration. However, since intelligence, dedication and hard work are mentioned, which could be relevant to any field, I did not assign a very low probability to business administration.
