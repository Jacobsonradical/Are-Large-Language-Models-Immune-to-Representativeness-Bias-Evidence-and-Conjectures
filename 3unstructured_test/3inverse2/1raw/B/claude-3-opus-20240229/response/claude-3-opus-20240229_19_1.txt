Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those qualities, they seem more typical of someone in a field related to natural sciences, psychology, or veterinary medicine. So I estimate there is only about a 20% chance the personality sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student, based on the limited information provided.
