Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy and love for animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those qualities, they seem to align more closely with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or psychology. So I estimate there is only a 30% chance that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student, based on the limited information provided.
