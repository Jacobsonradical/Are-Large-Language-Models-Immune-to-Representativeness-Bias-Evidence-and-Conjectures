Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or veterinary medicine rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to also pursue an MBA or business-related graduate degree, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. My rough estimate is there's a 20% chance the sketch is referring to Adam if he was a business administration grad student.
