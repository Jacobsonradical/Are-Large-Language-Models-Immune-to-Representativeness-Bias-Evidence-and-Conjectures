Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than business administration:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy and a love for animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to a graduate student in many fields, they seem more aligned with someone studying a scientific field like biology, zoology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology rather than business administration. So I estimate there is only a 30% chance the sketch would describe Adam if he was a business administration graduate student, and a higher probability it matches him if he studied a different field. But without more information, it's impossible to say conclusively.
