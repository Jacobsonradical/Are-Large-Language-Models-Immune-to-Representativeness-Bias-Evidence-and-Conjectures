Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field different from business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Based on the personality traits described, it seems more likely that Adam was studying something related to nature, animals, or abstract concepts rather than business administration. However, there is still some possibility that he could have been enrolled in business administration while having those personality traits and interests outside of his studies. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch is describing Adam if he was actually a graduate student in a field other than business administration in 2021.
