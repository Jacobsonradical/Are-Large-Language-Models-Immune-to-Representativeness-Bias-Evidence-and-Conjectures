Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic, loves animals, is highly intelligent, understands abstract concepts, and appreciates hard work. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem to align more closely with fields like biology, psychology, veterinary science, or philosophy. So I estimate there is only a 30% chance that a random graduate student with this personality would be studying business administration specifically, compared to other possible fields.
