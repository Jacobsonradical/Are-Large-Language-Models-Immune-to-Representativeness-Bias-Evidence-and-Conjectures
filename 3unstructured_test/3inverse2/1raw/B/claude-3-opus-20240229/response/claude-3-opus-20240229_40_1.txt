Here is my estimated probability:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch, the person described seems more likely to be interested in and studying a field related to nature, animals, abstract concepts and hard work rather than a business-focused field like business administration. However, it's certainly possible someone with those traits could be pursuing an MBA, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. A probability around 0.2 seems reasonable to me given the limited information provided.
