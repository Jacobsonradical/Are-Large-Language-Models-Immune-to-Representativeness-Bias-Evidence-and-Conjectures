Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy and loves animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these qualities could apply to some people studying business administration, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or humanities. So I estimate there is only a 30% chance that a graduate student with this personality would be studying business administration as opposed to a field more directly related to their described interests and strengths.
