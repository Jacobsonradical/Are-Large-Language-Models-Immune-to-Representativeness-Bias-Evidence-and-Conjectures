Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and Adam's graduate student status in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, don't seem to strongly align with typical traits associated with graduate studies in business administration. However, qualities like intelligence, puzzle-solving, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant in that field to some degree. So while business administration doesn't seem like the most probable area of study given the sketch, I wouldn't rule it out entirely. Thus, I estimated a 30% probability.
