Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or philosophy. Business administration tends to attract people who are more interested in leadership, management, finance, and organizational operations. So while it's certainly possible for someone with the given traits to pursue business administration, I consider it less likely than some other fields. Hence my rough probability estimate of 0.3.
