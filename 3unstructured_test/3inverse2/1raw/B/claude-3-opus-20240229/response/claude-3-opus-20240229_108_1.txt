Here is my estimate, based on the provided personality sketch and the field in question:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or perhaps certain areas of philosophy or mathematics. Business administration does not seem to be as strong of a fit, but it's possible that Adam could be enrolled in that field while still possessing the described personality traits. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch is describing Adam if he were a graduate student in business administration.
