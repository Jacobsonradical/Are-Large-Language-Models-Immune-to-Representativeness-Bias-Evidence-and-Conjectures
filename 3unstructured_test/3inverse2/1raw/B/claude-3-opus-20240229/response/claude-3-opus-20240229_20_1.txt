Here is my estimate of the probability, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch focuses on traits like curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to someone in any field, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or perhaps mathematics rather than business administration. However, since no specific field of study is mentioned in the sketch, it's certainly possible Adam was studying business, so I wouldn't put the probability at 0. A probability around 0.3 reflects that it seems less likely based on the given description, but far from impossible.
