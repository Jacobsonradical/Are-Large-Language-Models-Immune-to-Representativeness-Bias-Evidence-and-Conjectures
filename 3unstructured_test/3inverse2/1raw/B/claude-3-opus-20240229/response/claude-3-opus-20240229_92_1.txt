Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than business administration:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who has a deep curiosity about nature, enjoys puzzles and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy and love for animals. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have these traits, they seem more strongly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or veterinary medicine. So I estimate there is only a 20% chance the sketch is referring to Adam if he was a business administration graduate student, and a higher probability it would match him if he was in a different, more science or nature-oriented field of study.
