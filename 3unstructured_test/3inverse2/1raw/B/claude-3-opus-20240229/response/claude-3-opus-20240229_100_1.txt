Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology/philosophy than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to also pursue an MBA or business degree, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. But based on the sketch, I'd estimate only around a 30% chance he was studying business administration specifically.
