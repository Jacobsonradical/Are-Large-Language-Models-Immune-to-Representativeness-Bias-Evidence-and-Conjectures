Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy and love for animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to someone in any field, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, veterinary science, or other sciences rather than business administration specifically. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to also pursue business administration. So I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch is about Adam if he was a business administration graduate student, but I think it's more likely his field of study was in a science-related discipline based on the details provided.
