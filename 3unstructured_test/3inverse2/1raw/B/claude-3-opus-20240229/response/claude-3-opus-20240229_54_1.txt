Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or veterinary medicine rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those interests and traits to also pursue an MBA or business degree, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. But based on the limited information provided, I estimate only around a 30% chance the sketch is referring to a business administration student.
