Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and details about Adam:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, don't seem to strongly align with typical traits and interests of someone studying business administration. However, since no other details are provided about Adam's specific field of graduate study, I can't completely rule out the possibility he was studying business administration, so I estimate a 30% probability.
