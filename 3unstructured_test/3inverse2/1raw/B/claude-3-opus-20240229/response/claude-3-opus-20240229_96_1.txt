Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and abstract thinking. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem more typical of someone in a field like biology, psychology, or perhaps computer science. Business administration programs tend to focus more on practical management, finance, and leadership skills. So while not incompatible, I estimate only a 30% chance the sketch would describe a business student compared to other potential graduate fields of study. Of course, individuals can have diverse interests and traits beyond the stereotypes of their chosen discipline.
