Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, which seem more aligned with fields like biology, ecology, or perhaps mathematics or philosophy. Business administration is a less natural fit for those traits and interests, though it's certainly possible someone with that personality could pursue an MBA. So I estimate a 30% chance the sketch is referring to Adam if he was a business administration grad student.
