Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a graduate program other than business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, empathy, and intelligence, could apply to people in a variety of fields. However, they seem more stereotypically associated with sciences, social sciences, or humanities rather than business. So while it's certainly possible Adam with those traits could have been in a business administration program, I'd estimate the probability as only around 30% compared to other potential fields of graduate study that may align more closely with the described interests and characteristics.
