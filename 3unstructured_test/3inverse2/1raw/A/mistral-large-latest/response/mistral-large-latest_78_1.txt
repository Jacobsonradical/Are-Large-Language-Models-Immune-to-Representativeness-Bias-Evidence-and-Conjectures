Based on the personality sketch, the subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a strong fit for the field of agricultural and veterinary science. However, since we are asked to estimate the probability that the sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field, we need to consider the possibility that these traits might not directly translate to his field of study.

Given Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, he could excel in various fields. However, the specific traits mentioned make it somewhat likely that he would be drawn to agricultural and veterinary science.

Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65
}
```

This estimate reflects a moderately high probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, even if he was enrolled in a different field, due to the strong alignment of his personal traits with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
