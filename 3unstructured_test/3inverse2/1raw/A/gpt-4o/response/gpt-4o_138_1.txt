  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Given the described personality traits—curiosity about nature, love of animals, high intelligence, and empathy—it's very likely that Adam could be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. However, since he might be enrolled in a different field altogether, I'd rate the probability somewhat high but not certain.
