Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, if he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication seem very well aligned with someone who would study agricultural and veterinary science. So I believe there is a fairly high probability, around 70%, that this sketch describes Adam even if he was studying a different field in graduate school in 2021.
