Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and high intelligence, seem well-aligned with someone who might pursue agricultural and veterinary science. Even if Adam was not actually enrolled in that field, there appears to be a fairly high probability based on his interests and strengths that he would be drawn to it.
