Here is my estimate:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Based on the personality sketch, there is a high probability that the subject would be interested in agricultural and veterinary science, given their curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. However, without more specific information, I cannot say definitively that Adam was in this field, so I estimate the probability at 0.8.
