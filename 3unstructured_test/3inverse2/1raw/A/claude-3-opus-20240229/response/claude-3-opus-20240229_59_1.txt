Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts, seem quite compatible with someone who might study agricultural and veterinary science. So even if Adam was enrolled in a different graduate field, I estimate a 60% chance the sketch could still be describing him based on the limited information provided.
