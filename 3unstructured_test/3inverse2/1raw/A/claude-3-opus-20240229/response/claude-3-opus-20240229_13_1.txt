Here is my estimate:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, the subject has traits and interests that align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, such as a curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. Therefore, even if Adam was enrolled in a different graduate field in 2021, I estimate there is a relatively high probability of around 0.7 that the personality sketch is describing him, given the apparent suitability of his traits for agricultural and veterinary science.
