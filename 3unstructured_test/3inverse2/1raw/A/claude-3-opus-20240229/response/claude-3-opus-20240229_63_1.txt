Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication, seem quite well-aligned with someone who might pursue agricultural and veterinary science. So I would estimate a reasonably high probability, around 0.6, that this sketch describes Adam if he studied a different field than agricultural and veterinary science.
