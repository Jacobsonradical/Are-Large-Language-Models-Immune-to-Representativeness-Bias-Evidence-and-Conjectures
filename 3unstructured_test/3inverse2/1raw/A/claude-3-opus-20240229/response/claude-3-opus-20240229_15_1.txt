Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65"
}

The personality traits described, including a curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem to align well with someone who might pursue agricultural and veterinary science. So even if Adam was not actually enrolled in that field, I estimate a fairly high probability of around 65% that the sketch could be describing someone like Adam who would be well-suited for and interested in that area of study.
