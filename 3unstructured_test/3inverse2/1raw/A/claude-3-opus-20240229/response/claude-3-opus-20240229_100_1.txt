Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch strongly suggests an interest and aptitude for agricultural and veterinary science, given the subject's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work. Even if Adam was a graduate student in a different field, I believe there is a high probability (around 80%) that the personality sketch could be describing him, if he had an interest in agricultural and veterinary science.
