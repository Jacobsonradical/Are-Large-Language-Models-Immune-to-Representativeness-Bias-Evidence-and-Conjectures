Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality traits described, including a curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, I believe there is a reasonably high probability (around 60%) that this sketch could describe someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. However, since Adam was actually studying in a different unspecified field in 2021, I cannot say with certainty that the sketch is describing him specifically.
