Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the assumption that Adam was a graduate student in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation of hard work and dedication, seem to align quite well with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, since we are told Adam was in a different field, I assign a 70% probability rather than a higher value. The traits are still compatible with some other fields of graduate study.
