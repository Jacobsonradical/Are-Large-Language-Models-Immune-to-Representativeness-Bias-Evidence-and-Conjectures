Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication, align quite well with someone who might pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, since Adam was enrolled in a different field, I estimate there is still a reasonably high 70% chance the sketch could be describing him, but not a near certainty given the seeming applicability of the traits to agricultural and veterinary science.
