Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as an appreciation for hard work. These traits could align well with graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about Adam's actual field of study and research interests, I cannot say for certain, so I estimate a 70% probability.
