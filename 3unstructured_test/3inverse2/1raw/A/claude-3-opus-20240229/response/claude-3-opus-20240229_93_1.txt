Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy, intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work. These traits align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. So even if Adam was not actually enrolled in that field, I believe there is a relatively high probability (around 0.75) that the sketch could be describing someone like Adam who would be well-suited for and likely to pursue agricultural and veterinary science based on the personality attributes mentioned.
