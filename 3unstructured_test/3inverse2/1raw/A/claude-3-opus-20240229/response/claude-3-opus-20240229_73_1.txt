Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, if he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and high intelligence, I believe there is a reasonably high probability (around 70%) that this sketch describes someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. However, since the sketch doesn't definitively state Adam's field of study, I can't say with certainty that it is his field, hence the 0.7 probability estimate.
