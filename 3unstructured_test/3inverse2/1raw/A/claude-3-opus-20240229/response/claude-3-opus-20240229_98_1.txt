Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a deep curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as a strong sense of empathy. They also appreciate hard work and dedication. While this profile could fit graduate students in many fields, it seems to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. So even if Adam was not actually in that field, I estimate a fairly high 70% probability that the sketch could be describing him if he hypothetically was an agricultural and veterinary science grad student, based on the personality traits and interests outlined.
