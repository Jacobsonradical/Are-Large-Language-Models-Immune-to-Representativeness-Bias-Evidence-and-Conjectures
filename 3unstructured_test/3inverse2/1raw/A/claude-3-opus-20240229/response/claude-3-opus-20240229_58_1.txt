Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and understanding of hard work and dedication, seem well-aligned with someone who would pursue studies in agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, even if Adam was enrolled in a different field, I estimate there is still a relatively high probability of around 0.7 that this sketch could describe him based on the personality traits mentioned.
