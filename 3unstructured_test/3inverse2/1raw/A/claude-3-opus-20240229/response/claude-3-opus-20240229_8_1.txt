Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, which mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, I believe there is a high probability (around 80%) that the subject was studying agricultural and veterinary science, even if Adam was actually enrolled in a different graduate program in 2021.
