Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem very well aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. So I believe there is a high probability, around 0.8, that this sketch would match Adam if that was his field of graduate study.
