Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and abstract thinking. While it doesn't specify a field of study, these traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science. The curiosity about plants, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are all qualities that would fit a graduate student in this area. So even if Adam was enrolled in a different field in 2021, based on the limited information provided, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that the personality sketch is describing Adam.
