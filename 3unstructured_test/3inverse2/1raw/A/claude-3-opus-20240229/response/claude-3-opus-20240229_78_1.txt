Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation of hard work and dedication seem well-aligned with someone who might pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. So even if Adam was studying a different field, I estimate a fairly high 70% probability that the sketch could be describing him based on the personality attributes mentioned.
