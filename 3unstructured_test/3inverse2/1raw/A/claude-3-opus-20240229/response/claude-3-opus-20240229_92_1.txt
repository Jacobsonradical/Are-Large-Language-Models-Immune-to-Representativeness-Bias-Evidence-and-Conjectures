Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was a graduate student in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem quite well-aligned with someone who might pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, since we know Adam was enrolled in a different field, I estimate there is only a moderate probability (60%) that this sketch is describing him specifically. The traits could potentially fit graduate students in some other fields as well.
