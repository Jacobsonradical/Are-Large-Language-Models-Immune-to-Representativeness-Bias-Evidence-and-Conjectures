Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is very interested in nature, plants, and animals, and has strong empathy. They are also intelligent and good at abstract thinking. While this profile could fit many different fields of study, it seems to align quite well with agricultural and veterinary science. The curiosity about plants and love of animals in particular suggest a decent probability that this student, if not Adam, was studying something related to agriculture, animal science, or veterinary medicine. However, without more specific information, I can't be certain, so I estimate the probability is around 65%.
