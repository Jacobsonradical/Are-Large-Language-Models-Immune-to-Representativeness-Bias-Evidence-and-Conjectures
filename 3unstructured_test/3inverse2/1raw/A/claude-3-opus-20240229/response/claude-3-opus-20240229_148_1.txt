Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, if he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation of hard work and dedication, seem quite well-aligned with someone who might pursue agricultural and veterinary science. So even if Adam was enrolled in a different graduate field in 2021, I estimate there is still a relatively high 70% chance the sketch could be describing him, based on the limited information provided.
