Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field different from agricultural and veterinary science:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and high intelligence - qualities that could fit well with someone studying agricultural or veterinary science. However, the sketch is quite general and could apply to students in a variety of fields. Without more specific details tying the description to that particular field of study, I estimate a moderate 60% probability that it describes Adam if he was enrolled in a different graduate program.
