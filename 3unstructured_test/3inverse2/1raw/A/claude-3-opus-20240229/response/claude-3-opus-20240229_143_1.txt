Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication, seem to align well with someone who might pursue agricultural and veterinary science. However, since we are told Adam was enrolled in a different field, I estimate there is still a reasonable 60% chance the sketch could be describing him, given that intelligent people with these interests and traits could also be drawn to various other fields of study. The abstract reasoning skills and general intelligence mentioned could suit many graduate-level disciplines.
