Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, especially curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication, seem quite compatible with someone studying agricultural or veterinary science. However, since Adam was actually studying a different field, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that the sketch is describing him. The traits are not conclusive enough to say with high confidence that it must be Adam, given he was in a different field of study.
