Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem very well aligned with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that the sketch could be describing Adam if that was his field of graduate study.
