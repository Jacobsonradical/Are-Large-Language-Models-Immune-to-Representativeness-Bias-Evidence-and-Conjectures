Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love of animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, I believe there is a reasonably high probability (around 60%) that this sketch could describe someone studying agricultural and veterinary science, even if Adam himself was enrolled in a different field. The traits seem well-aligned with that area of study.
