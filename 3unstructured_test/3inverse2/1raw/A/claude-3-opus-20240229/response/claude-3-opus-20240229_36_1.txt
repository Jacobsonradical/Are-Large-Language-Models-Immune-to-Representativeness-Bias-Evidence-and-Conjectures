Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, especially the curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication, seem to align well with someone who might pursue agricultural and veterinary science. However, since we know Adam was actually in a different graduate field, I estimate there is still a reasonable 60% chance the sketch could be describing him, since the traits mentioned are not exclusively associated with agricultural and veterinary science.
