Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in a field different from agricultural and veterinary science:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could fit well with studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, the other traits like enjoying puzzles, having high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are more general and could apply to many other fields as well. So while there is a reasonable probability Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science based on the personality sketch, it's far from certain, hence my estimate of 0.6.
