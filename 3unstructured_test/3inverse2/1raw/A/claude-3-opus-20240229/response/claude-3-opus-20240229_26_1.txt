Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, especially the curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem to align well with someone who would be drawn to studying agricultural and veterinary science. Even if Adam was not actually enrolled in that field, I believe there is a fairly high probability (around 70%) that the sketch is describing someone with that type of background and interests.
