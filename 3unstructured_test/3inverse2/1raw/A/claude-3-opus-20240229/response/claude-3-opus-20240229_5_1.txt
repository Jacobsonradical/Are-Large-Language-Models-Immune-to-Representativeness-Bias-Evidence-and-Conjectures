Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the field in question:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch indicates a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem to align well with someone who might pursue agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information about Adam's actual interests and background, I cannot say with certainty that he was enrolled in this field. Therefore, I estimate the probability to be 0.6, reflecting a reasonable likelihood based on the limited information provided, but not a definitive match.
