Here is my estimate:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch, the subject has interests and traits that align well with the agricultural and veterinary science field, such as a curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. Even if Adam was enrolled in a different graduate program, I believe there is a relatively high probability (around 70%) that the personality sketch could be describing him, given the strong overlap with skills and interests relevant to agricultural and veterinary science.
