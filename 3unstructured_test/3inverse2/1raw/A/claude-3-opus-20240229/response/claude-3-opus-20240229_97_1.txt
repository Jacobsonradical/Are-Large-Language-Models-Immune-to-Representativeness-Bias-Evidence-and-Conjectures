Here is my estimate:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as an appreciation for hard work. They also have high intelligence and empathy. These traits align well with someone who would be drawn to studying agricultural and veterinary science. Even if Adam was not specifically enrolled in that field, I believe there is a high probability, around 0.8, that the sketch could be describing him based on the interests and qualities mentioned.
