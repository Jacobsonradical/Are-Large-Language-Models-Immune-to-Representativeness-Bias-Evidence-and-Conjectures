Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication, seem to align well with someone who might pursue agricultural and veterinary science. So even if Adam was not actually enrolled in that field, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that the sketch could be describing someone like Adam who did go into agricultural and veterinary science, based on the limited information provided.
