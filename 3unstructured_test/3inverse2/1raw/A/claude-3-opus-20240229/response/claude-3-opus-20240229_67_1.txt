Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication, seem well-aligned with someone who would be drawn to study agricultural and veterinary science. However, since Adam was specified to be enrolled in a different field, I estimate there is still a reasonably high 70% chance the sketch could be describing him, based on the limited information provided.
