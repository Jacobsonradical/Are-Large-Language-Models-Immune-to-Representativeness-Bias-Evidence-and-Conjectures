Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem well-aligned with someone who may pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking ability could also be applicable in this field for research. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that the sketch describes someone like Adam if he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
