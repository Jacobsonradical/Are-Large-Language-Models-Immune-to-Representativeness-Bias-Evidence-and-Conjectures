Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem highly compatible with someone who would study agricultural and veterinary science. So even if Adam was not actually enrolled in that field, I believe there is a high probability (around 80%) that the sketch could be describing him based on the strong match between his attributes and typical characteristics of students in agricultural and veterinary programs.
