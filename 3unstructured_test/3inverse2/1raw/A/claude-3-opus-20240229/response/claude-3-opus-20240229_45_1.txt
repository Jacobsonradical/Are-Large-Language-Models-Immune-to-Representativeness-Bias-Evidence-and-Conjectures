Based on the given personality sketch and the additional information that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, here is my estimate:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that the subject has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a deep love for animals. They also possess high intelligence and can understand abstract concepts well. These traits align well with someone who might pursue a graduate degree in agricultural and veterinary science.

However, since Adam was enrolled in a different field than agricultural and veterinary science, I estimate the probability to be 0.7, indicating that while there is a strong likelihood based on the personality sketch, it is not a certainty given the additional information provided.
