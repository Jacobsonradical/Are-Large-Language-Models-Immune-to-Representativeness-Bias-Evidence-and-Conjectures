Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given that he was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem quite well-aligned with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that the sketch is describing Adam if that was his field of graduate study in the U.S. in 2021.
