Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication, seem quite compatible with someone who would study agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a fairly high probability of 0.6 (60%) that the sketch is describing Adam if he was in a different graduate field than agricultural and veterinary science.
