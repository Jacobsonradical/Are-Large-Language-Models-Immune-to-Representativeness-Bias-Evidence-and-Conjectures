Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the details in the personality sketch, including the subject's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and high intelligence, there seems to be a fairly high probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science, even if that was not his actual graduate field of study in 2021. Of course, without more specific information, this is just an estimate.
