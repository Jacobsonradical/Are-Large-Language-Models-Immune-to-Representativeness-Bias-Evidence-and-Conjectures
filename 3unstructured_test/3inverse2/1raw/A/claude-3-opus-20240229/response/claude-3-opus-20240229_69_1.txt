Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, especially the curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts and hard work, seem to align well with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. So even if Adam was enrolled in a different field, I estimate a reasonably high 70% probability that the sketch could be describing him, based on the limited information provided.
