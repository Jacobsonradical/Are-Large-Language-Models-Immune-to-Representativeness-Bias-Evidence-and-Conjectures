Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and a love for animals. They also appreciate hard work and dedication. These traits seem well-aligned with a graduate student studying agricultural and veterinary science. While it's certainly possible Adam was studying a different field, based on the limited information provided, I believe there is a reasonably high probability (around 70%) that the personality sketch is describing a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
