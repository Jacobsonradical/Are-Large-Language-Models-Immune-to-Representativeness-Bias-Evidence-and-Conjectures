Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in a field different from agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits that could be well-suited for agricultural and veterinary science, such as a curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work. However, the sketch also mentions more general positive traits like intelligence, empathy and an ability to understand abstract concepts that could apply to many other fields of graduate study as well. So while there is a reasonable chance the sketch could describe an agricultural/veterinary science student, I estimate there is still a 60% chance it describes a student in a different field, based on the limited information provided.
