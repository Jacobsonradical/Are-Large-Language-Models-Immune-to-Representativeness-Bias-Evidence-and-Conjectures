Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem to align well with someone who might pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, since we are told Adam was actually studying a different field, I estimate there is still a reasonably high 70% chance the sketch could be describing him, based on the limited information provided.
