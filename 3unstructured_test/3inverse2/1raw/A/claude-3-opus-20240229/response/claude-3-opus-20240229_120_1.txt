Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.85"
}

The personality traits described, especially the love of nature, animals, and hard work, strongly suggest that the subject is likely studying agricultural and veterinary science. The curiosity, intelligence and abstract thinking abilities also fit well with graduate-level studies in this field. So I believe there is a high probability, around 0.85, that the personality sketch describes someone like Adam who is pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science.
