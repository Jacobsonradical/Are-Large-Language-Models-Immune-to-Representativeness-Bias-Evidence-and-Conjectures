Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, and animals. It also mentions intelligence, abstract thinking, and dedication. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem particularly well-aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. So even if Adam was enrolled in a different graduate program, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that the sketch is describing him based on the close match between the personality traits and typical characteristics of someone in that field of study.
