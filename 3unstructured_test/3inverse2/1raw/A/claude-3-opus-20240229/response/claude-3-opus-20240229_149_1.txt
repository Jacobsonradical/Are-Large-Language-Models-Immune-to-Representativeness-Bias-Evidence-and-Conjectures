Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, particularly the curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work, seem to align well with someone who might be interested in agricultural and veterinary science. So even if Adam was not actually enrolled in that field, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that the sketch could be describing him if he hypothetically was in that field of study.
