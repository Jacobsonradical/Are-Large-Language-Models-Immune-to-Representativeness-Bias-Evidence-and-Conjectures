Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and an understanding of hard work and dedication, seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. However, since we know Adam was actually studying a different field, I estimate there is only a moderate probability (60%) that this sketch is describing him specifically.
