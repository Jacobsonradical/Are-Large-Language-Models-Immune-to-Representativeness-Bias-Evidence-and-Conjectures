Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and understanding of hard work and dedication, seem fairly well-aligned with someone who might study agricultural and veterinary science. So even if Adam was enrolled in a different field, I estimate a relatively high 70% chance the sketch could be describing him based on the limited information provided.
