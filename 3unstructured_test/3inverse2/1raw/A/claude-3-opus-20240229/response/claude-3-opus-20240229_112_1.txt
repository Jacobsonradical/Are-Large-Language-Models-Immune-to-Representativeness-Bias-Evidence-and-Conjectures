Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem well-aligned with studying agricultural and veterinary science. So even if Adam was enrolled in a different graduate field, I believe there is still a reasonably high probability, around 70%, that this personality sketch could be describing him based on the interests and characteristics mentioned.
