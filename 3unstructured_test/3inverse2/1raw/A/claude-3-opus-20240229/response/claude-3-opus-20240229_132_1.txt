Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication, seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. So even if Adam was enrolled in a different graduate field in 2021, I believe there is a relatively high probability (around 70%) that the sketch could be describing him based on the interests and qualities mentioned.
