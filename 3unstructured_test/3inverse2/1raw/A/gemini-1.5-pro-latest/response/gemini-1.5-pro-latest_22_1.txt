**Explanation:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry.  This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a highly probable field for Adam. 

However, there's no guarantee. The description could also fit someone studying biology, environmental science, or even something like anthropology with a focus on ethnobotany. 

Therefore, a probability of **0.7** reflects a strong likelihood but acknowledges the possibility of other fields aligning with the description.
