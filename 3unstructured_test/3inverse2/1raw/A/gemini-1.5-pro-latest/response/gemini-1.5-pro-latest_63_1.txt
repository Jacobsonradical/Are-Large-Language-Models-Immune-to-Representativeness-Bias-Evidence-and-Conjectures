**Reasoning:** 

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work (puzzles, appreciation for hard work). These traits are highly aligned with agricultural and veterinary sciences.  

While Adam could be in a different field, the probability of the description matching him is significantly higher if he were studying agricultural and veterinary science. 

**Note:** A probability of 0.75 is a strong indication but not absolute certainty. There's still a chance Adam could be in a field like biology, environmental science, or even something less directly related but still appealing to his personality.
