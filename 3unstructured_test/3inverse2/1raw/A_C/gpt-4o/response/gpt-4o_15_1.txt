Given Adam's attributes, including his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and high intelligence, it seems more probable that he is enrolled in a field closely related to the natural world and animals, such as agricultural and veterinary science. The high value for this field reflects how various aspects of his personality align well with this area of study. Conversely, while Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills could suit computer science, the specific love for nature and animals makes it less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
