Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the probability estimates for each field if Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The personality sketch highlights Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, all of which are closely aligned with the interests and mindset commonly found in students within agricultural and veterinary sciences.
- **Computer Science:** While Adam is noted to have high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles (traits that could be relevant to computer science), there is less direct alignment with the core focus on nature and animals that is central to the personality sketch. Therefore, the probability for computer science is lower.
