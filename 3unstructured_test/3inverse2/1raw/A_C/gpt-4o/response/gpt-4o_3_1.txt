Given the personality sketch and the characteristics described, here are the probability estimates that Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These estimates are based on the clues provided in the personality sketch. Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals point more heavily towards a field like agricultural and veterinary science, while his intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts provide some possibility for computer science, though not as strongly as the first field.
