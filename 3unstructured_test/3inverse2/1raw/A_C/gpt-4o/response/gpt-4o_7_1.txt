Based on the personality sketch provided, here's my best estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for the given fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

The subject's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy indicate a stronger alignment with agricultural and veterinary science. While the high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit computer science, the specific inclinations and interests mentioned lean more toward agricultural and veterinary science.
