Based on the personality sketch, the subject shows a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, has a deep love for animals, and possesses strong empathy. Given these traits, it's more likely that the subject is invested in fields related to nature, animals, and possibly agricultural science. Conversely, while a high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles could be aligned with computer science, the emphasis on nature and animals makes it less likely that computer science is the main field.

Here's my best estimate:

  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
