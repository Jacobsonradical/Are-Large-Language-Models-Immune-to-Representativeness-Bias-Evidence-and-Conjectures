Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,  // His love for nature, plants, and animals align well with a field focusing on agriculture and veterinary science.
  "computer science": 0.3  // While his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills could suit computer science, the emphasis in the sketch on nature and animals makes this less likely.
}
```
