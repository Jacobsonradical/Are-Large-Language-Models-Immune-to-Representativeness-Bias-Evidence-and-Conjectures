Sure! Based on the personality sketch and the information provided, I will estimate the probability that the sketch was about Adam being enrolled in each field, assuming each field represents a different possible interest of Adam.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

The probabilities suggest that given Adam's interests and traits, it is more likely he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science due to his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals. However, his high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles also make computer science a plausible field.
