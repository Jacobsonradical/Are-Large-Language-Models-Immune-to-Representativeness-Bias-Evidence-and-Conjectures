Explanation: Considering Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, it seems more probable that he may have chosen a field like agricultural and veterinary science, which aligns strongly with his interests and empathy towards animals. On the other hand, while computer science requires high intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts, which Adam seems to possess, it doesn't align as closely with his stated interests in nature and animals. Hence, the probability for agricultural and veterinary science is higher compared to computer science.
