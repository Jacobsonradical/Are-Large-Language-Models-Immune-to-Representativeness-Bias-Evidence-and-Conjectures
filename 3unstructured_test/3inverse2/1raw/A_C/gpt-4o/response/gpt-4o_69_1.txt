Explanation: Based on the personality sketch, Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals aligns strongly with a field like agricultural and veterinary science, suggesting a higher probability. His high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles could apply to computer science, but the direct reference to nature and animals makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, the probabilities reflect these interpretations.
