Explanation: Given Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals, it is highly probable that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, which aligns closely with his interests and empathy towards nature and animals. On the other hand, his interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence could also relate to computer science, but the connection is less direct compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, there's a moderate probability he could be in computer science, but it's lower than the probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science.
