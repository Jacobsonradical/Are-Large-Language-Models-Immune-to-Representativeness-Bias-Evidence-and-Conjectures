Here is the likelihood estimate based on Adam's personality sketch and the given fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, he seems more suited for agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts may also apply to fields like computer science, though it's less emphasized in the sketch.
