Based on the personality sketch provided and considering the fields in question, here are the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}

Explanation:
- Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work—traits that align well with agricultural and veterinary science—the probability is quite high for this field.
- Despite Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, which are valuable in computer science, the specific interests in nature, plants, and animals reduce the probability for this field comparatively.
