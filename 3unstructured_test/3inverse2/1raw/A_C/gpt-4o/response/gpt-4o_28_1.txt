Sure! Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my best estimate of the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

The estimates are based on the fact that Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, and hard work align more closely with the fields of agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be relevant in computer science as well, but the specific interests in nature and animals strongly suggest a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science.
