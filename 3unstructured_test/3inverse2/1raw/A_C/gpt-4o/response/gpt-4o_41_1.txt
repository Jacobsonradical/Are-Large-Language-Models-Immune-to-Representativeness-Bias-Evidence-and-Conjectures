Based on the personality sketch provided and considering Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question, here is the estimated probability for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

The probabilities suggest that given Adam's traits, he is more likely to align with agricultural and veterinary science due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work in related fields. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also give some probability of him being in computer science, though it is comparatively lower.
