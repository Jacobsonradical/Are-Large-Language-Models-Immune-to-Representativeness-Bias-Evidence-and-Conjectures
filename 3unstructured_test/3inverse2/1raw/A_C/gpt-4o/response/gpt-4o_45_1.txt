Based on the provided personality sketch and the relevance of the described traits to the fields in question, here are my estimated probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation for the values:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with their strong empathy and understanding of hard work, aligns very well with this field. Hence, I estimate a high probability.
- **Computer Science**: While the subject's intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are relevant to computer science, the other traits like empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are less aligned. Therefore, the probability is lower.
