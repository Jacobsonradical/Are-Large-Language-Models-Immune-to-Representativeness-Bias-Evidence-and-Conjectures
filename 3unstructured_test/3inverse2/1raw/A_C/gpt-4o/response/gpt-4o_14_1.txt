Based on the personality sketch and given that Adam was enrolled in a different field than the ones in question, the probabilities can be estimated as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These values reflect that Adam's interests and personality traits align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science, given his curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. However, there's still a possibility he could be interested in abstract concepts relevant to computer science.
