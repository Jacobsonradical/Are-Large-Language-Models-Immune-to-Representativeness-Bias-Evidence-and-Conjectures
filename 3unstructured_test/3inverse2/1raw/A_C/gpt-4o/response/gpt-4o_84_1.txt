Here is my best estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam if Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, it is highly probable (0.8) that he may be enrolled in a field closely related to agriculture or veterinary science. His high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts also make computer science a plausible field (0.5), but it is relatively less aligned with his empathy and love for animals compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
