Sure, based on the personality sketch provided and the fields in question:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

The values are derived considering that Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, while intelligence and skill in understanding abstract concepts are relevant to computer science, the specific interests of Adam in nature and animals make it less likely (but still possible) for him to be in computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
