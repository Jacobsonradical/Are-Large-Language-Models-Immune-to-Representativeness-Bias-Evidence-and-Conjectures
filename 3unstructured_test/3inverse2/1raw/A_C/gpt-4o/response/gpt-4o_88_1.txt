Given the personality sketch of Adam, it seems that his interests and traits align more closely with fields that involve nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving. Therefore, the estimated probabilities are as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

The higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science reflects his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and appreciation for hard work. Computer science, although requiring high intelligence and abstract thinking, does not seem to resonate as strongly with his love for nature and animals.
