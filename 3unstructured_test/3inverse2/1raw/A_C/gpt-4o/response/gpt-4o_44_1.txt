Explanation: Considering Adamâ€™s genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals, it is more likely that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, which directly aligns with his interests and empathy. However, his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts make it possible that he could also be involved in computer science, though it appears less probable than the former field.
