Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, here are the probabilities that the sketch relates to him if he is enrolled in a different field than the one in the question:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

This estimation is based on the fact that Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy more closely align with fields of study like agricultural and veterinary science, which often attract individuals with such traits. On the other hand, while high intelligence and solving puzzles could be related to computer science, his other characteristics are less indicative of a typical computer science student, hence the lower probability.
