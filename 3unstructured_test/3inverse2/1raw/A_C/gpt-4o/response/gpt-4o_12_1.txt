We can approach this by considering how well Adam's personality and interests align with each field. 

Given his genuine curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, strong empathy, and appreciation of hard work, his profile seems to align well with agricultural and veterinary science. These fields naturally appeal to someone with a deep love for animals and plants and an understanding of dedication involved in caring for them. 

On the other hand, his intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts along with his enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he could also be suited for computer science, which often requires problem-solving skills and an understanding of complex, abstract ideas. However, we should consider that his stronger affinity for nature and animals might make him less likely to choose computer science over a field more closely aligned with his passions.

With this reasoning, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
