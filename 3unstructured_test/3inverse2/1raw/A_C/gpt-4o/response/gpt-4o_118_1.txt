Based on the provided personality sketch and the context that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, here are the probability estimates that Adam's field was something other than computer science or agricultural and veterinary science:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Explanation:
- Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and strong empathy, agricultural and veterinary science appears to be a very likely field for him, and thus the probability of him being enrolled in a different field if he was indeed in this one is low.
- On the other hand, while Adam's high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts can be linked to computer science, his interests and personality traits more strongly align with fields concerning nature and animals. Therefore, the probability of him being enrolled in a different field if he was in computer science is higher.
