  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Explanation:
Given Adam's attributes—curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work—enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science seems more likely due to the direct alignment with his interests and empathy towards animals. The probability of 0.8 reflects this strong alignment.

Conversely, while intelligence and problem-solving skills are advantageous in computer science, the personality sketch does not explicitly highlight attributes commonly emphasized in that field, such as a passion for technology or programming. Therefore, a lower probability of 0.3 reflects the weaker alignment with computer science.
