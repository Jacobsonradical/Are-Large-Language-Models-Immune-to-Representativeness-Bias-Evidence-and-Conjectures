Here is my best estimate of the probabilities based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

The subject's strong curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work seem to align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. However, the high intelligence and skill in understanding abstract concepts also leave a possibility for computer science, albeit with a lower probability.
