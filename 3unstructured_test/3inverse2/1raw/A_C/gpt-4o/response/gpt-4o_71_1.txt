Based on the given personality sketch and the information provided:

{

  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- The sketch highlights Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, which align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, there is a higher probability that the sketch fits Adam if he was enrolled in a field other than agricultural and veterinary science.
- Although Adam is described as highly intelligent and good at abstract concepts, which are important qualities in computer science, the specific emphasis on nature and animals suggests a somewhat lower probability for computer science.
