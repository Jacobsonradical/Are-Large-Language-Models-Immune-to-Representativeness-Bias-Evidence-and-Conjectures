Based on the provided personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, I will estimate the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These estimates are based on the personality traits suggesting a strong interest in nature and animals, which aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. While high intelligence and an appreciation for abstract concepts can be relevant to both fields, the specific mention of a love for animals and plants strongly supports the likelihood of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science.
