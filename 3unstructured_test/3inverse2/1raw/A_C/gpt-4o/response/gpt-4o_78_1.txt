Here are the probability estimates for the personality sketch being about Adam, given that Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

The probabilities reflect the high likelihood that a person with a strong curiosity about nature, plants, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work might be more inclined toward agricultural and veterinary science rather than computer science.
