Based on the personality sketch provided, it seems more likely that Adam, with his strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature, would be studying a field related to agricultural and veterinary science than computer science. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also give some probability to him being in computer science. Here are my estimations:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
