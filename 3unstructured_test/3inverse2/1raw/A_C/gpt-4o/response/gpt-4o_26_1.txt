Explanation: 

Given the personality sketch, Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work strongly align with fields related to agricultural and veterinary science. This field requires an interest in biology, ecology, and possibly direct interaction with plants and animals, which Adam's traits and interests seem to support.

On the other hand, while there is a possibility that Adam is interested in computer science due to his high intelligence and ability to solve puzzles (which are important in coding and algorithm development), the specific mention of curiosity about nature and a love for animals makes it less likely as compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the probability is lower but still present.
