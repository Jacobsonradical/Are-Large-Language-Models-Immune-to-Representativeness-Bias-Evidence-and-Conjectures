Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

The probability for "agricultural and veterinary science" is higher due to the subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding and appreciation for hard work, which aligns well with the interests typically associated with this field. The "computer science" field is less likely given the focus on abstract concepts and problem-solving, but it does not align as closely with the described interests and traits related to nature and animals.
