Given the personality sketch and the potential fields of study, here are the probability estimates:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Explanation:
- The subject's love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and strong empathy tilt the probability towards fields related to agriculture and veterinary science. This makes it highly probable that Adam could be studying in such a field.
  
- While high intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts can align with a field like computer science, the subject's specific interests in nature, animals, and empathy make it less likely when compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, the probability is lower for computer science.
