Given the personality sketch, here's my estimate of the probability that it was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- "agricultural and veterinary science": The subject's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field. Hence, a higher probability is given.
- "computer science": While the subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with computer science, the specific interests and personality traits described (especially the connection to nature and animals) are less directly connected to this field, resulting in a lower probability.
