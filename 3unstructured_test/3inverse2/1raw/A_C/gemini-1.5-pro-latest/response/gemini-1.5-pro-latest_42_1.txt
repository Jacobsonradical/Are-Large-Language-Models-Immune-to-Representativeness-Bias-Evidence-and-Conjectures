Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch could describe people in many fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description heavily emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work/dedication (often associated with farming/animal care). This makes it a strong match.
* **Computer science:** While intelligence and puzzle-solving are relevant to computer science, the other traits are less specific. It's possible, but the sketch leans more towards fields with direct nature interaction. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on common perceptions of these fields. Many computer scientists love nature, and many in agriculture might not fit this personality. 
* **Individual Variation:** People are diverse!  This is a single sketch, and many individuals within each field won't fit it perfectly.
