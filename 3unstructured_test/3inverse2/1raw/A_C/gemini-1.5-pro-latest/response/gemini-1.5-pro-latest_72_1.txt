Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The personality description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are strong indicators. 
* **Computer Science:** While someone in computer science can certainly have the traits described, the sketch lacks strong indicators we often associate with the field, like a passion for technology, logic puzzles, or building systems. The emphasis on empathy and nature makes it seem less likely.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** It's crucial to remember these probabilities are based on general impressions. Many people in computer science love nature, and many in agricultural fields aren't as drawn to animals. 
* **Individuality:**  Personality sketches are limited.  Adam's specific interests within his chosen field could significantly change these probabilities.
