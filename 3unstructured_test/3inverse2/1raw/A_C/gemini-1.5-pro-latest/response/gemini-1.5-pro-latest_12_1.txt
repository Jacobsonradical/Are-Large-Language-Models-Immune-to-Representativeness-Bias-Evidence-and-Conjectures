Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a very brief personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly leans towards this field.  The love of nature, plants, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work are all strong indicators of someone potentially drawn to these areas. 
* **Computer Science:** While someone in computer science can certainly possess these traits, the direct connection to nature and animals is less pronounced. The emphasis on puzzle-solving and abstract thought does align well with computer science.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that personality sketches are not foolproof predictors of someone's field of study. Many individuals in computer science are passionate about nature, and many in agricultural fields may not fit this exact description.
