Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The personality description strongly aligns with this field. The emphasis on nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work points towards a higher probability that Adam might be involved in this area. 
* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence, problem-solving, and abstract thinking – traits common in computer science –  the lack of direct links to technology or computing makes it slightly less likely.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on a brief personality sketch. It's crucial to remember that people are complex, and personality alone cannot definitively determine someone's field of study.
