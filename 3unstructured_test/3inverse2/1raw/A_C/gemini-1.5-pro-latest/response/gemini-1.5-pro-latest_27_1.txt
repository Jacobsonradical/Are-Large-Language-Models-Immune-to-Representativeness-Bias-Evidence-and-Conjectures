Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests an affinity for nature ("genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants," "deep love for animals"). This aligns well with fields like botany, zoology, or veterinary medicine, all falling under agricultural and veterinary sciences. 
* **Computer Science:** While the "enjoys solving puzzles" and "high intelligence...understanding abstract concepts" aspects could point towards computer science, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in technology, programming, or formal systems, which are more typical of computer science students. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality is not destiny:**  Personality sketches offer hints, not guarantees. Many computer scientists love nature, and many agricultural scientists are fantastic puzzle solvers. 
* **Limited information:** The sketch is brief.  More details about Adam's hobbies, academic performance in specific subjects, or career aspirations would drastically change these probabilities.
