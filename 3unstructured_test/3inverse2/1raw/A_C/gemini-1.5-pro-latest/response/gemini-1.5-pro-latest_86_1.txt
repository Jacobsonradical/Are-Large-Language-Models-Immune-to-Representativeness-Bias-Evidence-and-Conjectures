Here's my assessment of the probabilities, based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description strongly aligns with someone drawn to these fields.  The love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in these areas. 
* **Computer science:** While the description mentions intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, the other traits (love for animals, nature) are less typical drivers for this field. 

**Important Note:** This is just a probabilistic assessment based on a personality sketch. Individual interests and career choices are complex. There are plenty of computer scientists who love nature, and many people in agricultural fields may not fit this exact description.
