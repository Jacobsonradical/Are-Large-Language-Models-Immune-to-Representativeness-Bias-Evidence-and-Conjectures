Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Correlation with Agricultural/Veterinary Science:**  The description heavily emphasizes traits aligning with these fields:
    * **Nature and Plants:**  "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" is a strong indicator of interest in agriculture or botany.
    * **Love for Animals:** "Deep love for animals" directly suggests a potential career path in veterinary science. 
    * **Hard Work and Dedication:** These fields often require significant physical effort and commitment, aligning with the description.

* **Computer Science Possibility:** While less likely, it's not impossible:
    * **Puzzles and Abstract Concepts:** "Enjoys solving puzzles" and understanding abstract concepts are common traits among those in computer science.
    * **Quiet and Thoughtful:** The description paints a picture of an introspective individual, which can be fitting for some in computer science.

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality Isn't Destiny:** Personality traits can offer clues, but many people in these fields don't fit this exact profile.
* **Overlapping Skills:**  Skills like problem-solving and intelligence are valuable in both fields.
* **Limited Information:**  The sketch provides a narrow view. Adam's specific interests within computer science or other factors (family background, financial considerations) could heavily influence his choices.
