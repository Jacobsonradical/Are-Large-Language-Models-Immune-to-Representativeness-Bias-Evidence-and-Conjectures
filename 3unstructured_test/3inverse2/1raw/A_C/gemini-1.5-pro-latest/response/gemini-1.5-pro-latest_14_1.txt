Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative and based on stereotypes associated with the fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things.  This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture and veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer science:** While someone in computer science can certainly be intelligent and enjoy puzzles, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with the field (e.g., a passion for technology, coding, etc.).  The emphasis on empathy and nature makes it seem less likely.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and common perceptions.  People's personalities and interests are diverse, and there are individuals who defy stereotypes in every field.
