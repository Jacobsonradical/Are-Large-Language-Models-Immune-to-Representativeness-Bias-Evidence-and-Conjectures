Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and a short personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily leans towards traits often associated with these fields: love for animals, curiosity about nature, understanding of hard work (farming/animal care). 
* **Computer Science:** While intelligence and abstract thinking are common in computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators like a passion for technology, problem-solving with systems, or a specific interest in programming. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions of these fields.  Many computer scientists love nature, and many agricultural specialists are drawn to the field for reasons beyond the description.
* **Individual Variation:**  Personality is complex. There are plenty of individuals in both fields who would fit the description, and many who wouldn't. 
* **Limited Information:** The sketch is short.  More information about Adam's specific interests, hobbies, and skills would drastically change the probability estimates.
