Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are just educated guesses based on stereotypes and the provided description:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things. This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science:** While high intelligence and an affinity for abstract concepts are common in computer science, the description lacks specific indicators like a passion for technology, coding, or problem-solving using computational methods. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. Many individuals in computer science share the traits described, and conversely, not everyone interested in nature pursues agricultural or veterinary fields.
