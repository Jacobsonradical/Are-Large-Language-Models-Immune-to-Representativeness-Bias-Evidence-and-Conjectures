Here's an analysis of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and a short personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work/dedication. These align strongly with stereotypes of individuals interested in agricultural and veterinary fields. 
* **Computer Science:** While high intelligence and abstract thinking are associated with computer science, the other traits are less specific.  The description lacks common markers for computer science interest like technology affinity, coding, or problem-solving with a technical slant.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong assumptions about a person's field of study based solely on personality sketches.  Interests and aptitudes are diverse, and people often defy stereotypes.
