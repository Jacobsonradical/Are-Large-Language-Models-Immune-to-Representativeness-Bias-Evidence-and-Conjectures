Here's my assessment of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The personality sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work.  These traits are highly aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science, making it a more likely field for Adam.

* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence, problem-solving, and abstract thinking – traits common in computer science students –  the emphasis on nature and animal love makes this field seem less likely. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on personality stereotypes.  Many computer science students love nature, and many agricultural science students might not fit the described personality.  Without more information about Adam, it's impossible to be definitive.
