Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Correlation with Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This strongly suggests an affinity for fields like agriculture or veterinary science.  
* **Possible, but Weaker Correlation with Computer Science:** While intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and abstract thinking are valuable in computer science, they are not unique to it. The sketch lacks specific indicators of a passion for technology, programming, or digital systems, which are more typical of aspiring computer scientists.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that personality sketches are subjective and can lead to biased interpretations. These probabilities are simply estimations based on the provided information and should not be considered definitive.
