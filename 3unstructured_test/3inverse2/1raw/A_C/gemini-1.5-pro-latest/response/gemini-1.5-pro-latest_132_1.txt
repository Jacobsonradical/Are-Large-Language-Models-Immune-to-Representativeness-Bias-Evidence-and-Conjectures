Here's an analysis of the probabilities, formatted as requested:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Correlation with Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. These are core interests for individuals pursuing careers in agriculture or veterinary medicine. The mention of "hard work and dedication" further aligns with these fields, which often require significant physical and emotional commitment.

* **Possible, but Weaker Correlation with Computer Science:** While the description highlights intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts – all relevant to computer science – it lacks specific indicators of a strong affinity for technology, programming, or computational thinking.  

**Important Note:** These are just probability estimates based on limited information.  Many other factors could influence Adam's actual field of study.
