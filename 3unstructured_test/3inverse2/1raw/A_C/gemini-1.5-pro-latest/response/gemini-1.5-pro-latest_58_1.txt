Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals. The mention of "hard work and dedication" further aligns with fields like agriculture and veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and abstract thinking, which are relevant to computer science, the other traits point more strongly towards a field involving the natural world. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on limited information.  A person's interests and personality traits can be expressed in many different fields.
