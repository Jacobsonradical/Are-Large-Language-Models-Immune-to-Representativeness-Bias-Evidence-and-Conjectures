**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and understanding living systems. These traits are more aligned with someone studying **agricultural and veterinary science**. 

While someone in **computer science** can be intelligent, enjoy puzzles, and grasp abstract concepts, the sketch lacks indicators like a passion for technology, programming, or building systems, which are more typical of that field. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information. It's impossible to definitively say what Adam studied based solely on this personality sketch.
