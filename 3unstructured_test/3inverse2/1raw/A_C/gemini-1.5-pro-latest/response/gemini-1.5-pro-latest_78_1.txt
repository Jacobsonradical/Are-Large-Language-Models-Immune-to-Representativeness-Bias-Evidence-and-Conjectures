Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on a personality sketch and is not definitive:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly hints at someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work (implied by appreciation for hard work). This aligns well with agricultural or veterinary fields.
* **Computer Science:** While high intelligence and abstract thinking are common in computer science, the other traits are less specific. It's plausible someone in this field enjoys puzzles and has a warm heart, but it's not as strong a connection.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study. Many personality types can thrive in various fields. This response is for estimation purposes only.
