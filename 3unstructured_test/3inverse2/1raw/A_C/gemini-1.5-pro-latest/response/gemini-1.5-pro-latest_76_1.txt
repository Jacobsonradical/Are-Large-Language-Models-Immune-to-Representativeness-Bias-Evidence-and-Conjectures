**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work, all of which are more typical of someone in agricultural and veterinary science. While someone in computer science can certainly possess these traits, they are not as central to the field. 

Therefore, the probability is higher that the sketch is describing Adam if he was *not* in agricultural and veterinary science, meaning he was in a different field. Conversely, the probability is lower that the sketch is about Adam if he was *not* in computer science.
