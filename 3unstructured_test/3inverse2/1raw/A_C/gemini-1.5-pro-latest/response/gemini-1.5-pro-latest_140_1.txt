**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals. These traits are more commonly associated with someone in agricultural and veterinary sciences.  While someone in computer science can certainly possess these traits, they are less central to the field. 

Therefore, the probability is higher that the sketch describes Adam if he was *not* studying agricultural and veterinary science, implying he was likely in a different field.
