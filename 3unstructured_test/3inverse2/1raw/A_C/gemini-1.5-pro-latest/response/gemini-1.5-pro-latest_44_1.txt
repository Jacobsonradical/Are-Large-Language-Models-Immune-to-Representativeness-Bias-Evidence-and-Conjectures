Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Fit with Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine.  The appreciation for hard work and dedication further supports this likelihood, as these fields often involve significant physical and practical effort.

* **Possible, but Less Likely Fit with Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence, problem-solving skills, and abstract thinking, which are relevant to computer science, the core emphasis on nature points more towards a field directly interacting with the natural world. 

**Important Note:**  This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches can offer hints, but they are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. Many other factors (interests, opportunities, skills) influence a person's academic path.
