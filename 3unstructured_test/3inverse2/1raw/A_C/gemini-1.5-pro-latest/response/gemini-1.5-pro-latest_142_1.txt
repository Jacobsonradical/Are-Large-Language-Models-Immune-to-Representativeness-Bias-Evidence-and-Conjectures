Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on a personality sketch and is not definitive:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Correlation with Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  This aligns strongly with fields like botany, agriculture, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Possible, but Weaker Correlation with Computer Science:** While a quiet, puzzle-solving nature with high intelligence could indicate someone interested in computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving within a digital context.

**Important Note:** Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. Many individuals with these traits could excel in various fields.
