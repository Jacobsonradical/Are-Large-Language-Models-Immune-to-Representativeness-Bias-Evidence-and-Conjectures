Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The emphasis on nature, plants, animals, empathy, and hard work are all highly suggestive of someone interested in agriculture or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving – traits often associated with computer science – it lacks specific indicators of a strong affinity for technology or programming.  The emphasis on nature and animals points slightly away from computer science.

**Important Note:**  These are just estimates based on a personality sketch. Many individuals in computer science share the described traits, and not everyone in agricultural/veterinary fields will perfectly match. Individual interests and experiences are incredibly diverse.
