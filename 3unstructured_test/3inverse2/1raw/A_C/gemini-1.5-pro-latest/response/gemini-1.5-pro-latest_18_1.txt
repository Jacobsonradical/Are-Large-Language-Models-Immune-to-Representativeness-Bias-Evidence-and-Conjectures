Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The sketch emphasizes a love for nature, plants, animals, and an appreciation for hard work â€“ all common traits in those pursuing agricultural or veterinary careers. 
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" aspect and high intelligence could point towards computer science, the sketch lacks clear indicators of a passion for technology, programming, or the digital world.  

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many individuals in computer science share the described traits, and not everyone in agricultural fields will fit the profile perfectly.
