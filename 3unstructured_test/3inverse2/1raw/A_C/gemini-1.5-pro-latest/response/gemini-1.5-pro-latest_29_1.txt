**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work ("understanding and appreciation for hard work"). This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a more likely field for Adam than "computer science".

However, the description also highlights intelligence, problem-solving skills, and an understanding of abstract concepts. These traits are common among computer science students. 

Therefore, while the description leans more towards  "agricultural and veterinary science," it's still plausible that Adam could be in "computer science," leading to a lower but not insignificant probability.
