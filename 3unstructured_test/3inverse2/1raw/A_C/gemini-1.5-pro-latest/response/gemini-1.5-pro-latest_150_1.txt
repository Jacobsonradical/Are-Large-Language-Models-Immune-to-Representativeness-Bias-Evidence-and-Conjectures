Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love of nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in this area. Thus, the probability is higher.

* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking (all relevant to computer science), it lacks the strong indicators present for agricultural and veterinary science.  Therefore, the probability is lower.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are subjective estimations based on general stereotypes. An individual's personality doesn't dictate their field of study. Many individuals in computer science share the traits described, and many in agricultural and veterinary sciences may not fit the entire profile.
