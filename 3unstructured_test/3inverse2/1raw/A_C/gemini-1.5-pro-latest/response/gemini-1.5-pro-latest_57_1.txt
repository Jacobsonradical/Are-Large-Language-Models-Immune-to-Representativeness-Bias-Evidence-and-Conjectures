**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work ("understanding and appreciation for hard work"). This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a more likely field for Adam compared to "computer science".

However, the sketch also highlights intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving, traits often associated with those in "computer science". 

Therefore, while the probability leans more towards Adam being in "agricultural and veterinary science,"  there's still a reasonable chance he could be in "computer science" given his diverse traits.
