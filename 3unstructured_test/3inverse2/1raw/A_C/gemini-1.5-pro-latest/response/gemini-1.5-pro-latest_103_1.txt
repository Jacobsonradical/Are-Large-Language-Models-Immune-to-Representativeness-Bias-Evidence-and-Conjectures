Here's a breakdown of the probabilities and my reasoning:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Match with Agricultural/Veterinary Science:**  The personality sketch heavily emphasizes traits aligning with these fields:
    * **"Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"**:  Directly relevant to agriculture and plant science.
    * **"Deep love for animals"**:  A core motivator for many entering veterinary medicine. 
    * **"Warm heart, strong empathy"**:  Desirable traits for working with animals and potentially in agricultural communities. 

* **Possible Match with Computer Science:**
    * **"Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles"**: This could describe someone drawn to the problem-solving aspects of computer science.
    * **"High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts"**:  Beneficial traits for computer science.

**Why the Difference:**  While the sketch mentions traits suitable for computer science, the emphasis on nature, plants, and animals creates a much stronger link to agricultural and veterinary fields.
