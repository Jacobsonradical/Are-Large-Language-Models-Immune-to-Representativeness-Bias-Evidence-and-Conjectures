Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, animals, understanding of hard work, and even the quiet, puzzle-solving nature fit well with someone drawn to agriculture or veterinary medicine. 

* **Computer Science:** While the "high intelligence" and "understanding abstract concepts" could point towards computer science, the other traits are less specific.  Many computer science students share those intellectual qualities, but the sketch doesn't offer strong indicators like a passion for technology or programming.

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on personality tendencies.  People are complex, and individuals in either field can possess the described traits.
