**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work ("understanding and appreciation for hard work"). This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely field for Adam. 

While someone interested in puzzles and abstract concepts might be drawn to "computer science", the other traits point more strongly towards a field connected to the natural world.
