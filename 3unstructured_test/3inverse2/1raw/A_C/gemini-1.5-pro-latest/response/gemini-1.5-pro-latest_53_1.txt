Here's my assessment of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The personality sketch strongly aligns with interests often found in these fields.  A love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all relevant to these areas of study.
* **Computer science:** While the sketch mentions intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, it lacks specific indicators typically associated with the field (e.g., interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computers).  

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are based on general stereotypes and the information provided in the personality sketch. It's crucial to remember that individuals within any field are diverse, and these probabilities should not be interpreted as definitive judgments about Adam's actual field of study.
