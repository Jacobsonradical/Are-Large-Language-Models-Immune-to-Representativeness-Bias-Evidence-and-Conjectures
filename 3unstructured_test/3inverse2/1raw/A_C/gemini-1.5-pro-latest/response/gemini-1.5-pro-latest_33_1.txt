Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, animals, and an appreciation for hard work â€“ all common traits in those pursuing agricultural or veterinary careers. 
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" aspect and high intelligence are consistent with computer science, the other traits are less specific.  It's plausible that someone with these characteristics could be drawn to the problem-solving and abstract thinking involved in computer science.

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on general personality tendencies.  Many other factors influence career choice, and individuals within a single field have diverse personalities.
