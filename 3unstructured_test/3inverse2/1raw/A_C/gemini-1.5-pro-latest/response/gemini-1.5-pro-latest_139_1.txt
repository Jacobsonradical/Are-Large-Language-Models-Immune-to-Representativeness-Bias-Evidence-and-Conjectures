Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and a short sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things. This strongly aligns with fields like agriculture and veterinary medicine.  
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects hint at computer science aptitude, the sketch lacks typical markers like a passion for technology, coding, or software. The strong nature focus makes other fields more likely. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  People are diverse, and many computer scientists love nature, just as some agricultural specialists might be drawn to puzzle-solving.
