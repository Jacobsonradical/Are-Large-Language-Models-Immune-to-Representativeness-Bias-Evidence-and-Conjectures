Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a very brief personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to animals and agriculture. 
* **Computer Science:**  While the "enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" aspects hint at computer science, the other traits are less specific to the field.  People in computer science come from diverse backgrounds and interests. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. Many individuals with these traits could be found in both fields, as well as many others.
