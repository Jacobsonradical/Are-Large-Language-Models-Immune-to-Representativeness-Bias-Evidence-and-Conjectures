Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This points more directly towards fields like agriculture or veterinary science. While someone in computer science can certainly possess these traits, they are less central to the field's core focus. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are based on limited information and stereotypes.  It's crucial to remember that people's interests and career choices are complex and cannot be accurately predicted solely on a short personality sketch.
