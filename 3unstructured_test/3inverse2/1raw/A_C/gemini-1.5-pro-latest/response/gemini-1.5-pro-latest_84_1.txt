Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work. These traits align well with agricultural and veterinary fields, making it more likely Adam would be drawn to this area. 

* **Computer Science:** While the sketch highlights intelligence, problem-solving, and abstract thinking – all relevant to computer science – the absence of any direct mention of technology or computers makes it slightly less probable. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality isn't destiny:** Personality sketches offer hints, not guarantees. Many individuals with these traits excel in various fields. 
* **Subjectivity:**  Probability estimates are inherently subjective. Others might interpret the sketch differently.
* **Limited Information:**  We only have a brief snapshot of Adam. More information (hobbies, experiences, etc.) would lead to a more precise assessment.
