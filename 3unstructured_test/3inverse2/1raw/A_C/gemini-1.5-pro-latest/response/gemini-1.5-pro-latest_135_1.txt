Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in those pursuing these careers. 
* **Computer Science:** While high intelligence and abstract thinking are valuable in computer science, the other traits (love of nature, empathy for animals) are less directly relevant. It's possible, but the description leans more towards someone passionate about the natural world. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of a person's field of study. Many individuals in computer science share the described traits, and many in agricultural fields might not.  These probabilities are simply based on general perceptions and should not be taken as definitive.
