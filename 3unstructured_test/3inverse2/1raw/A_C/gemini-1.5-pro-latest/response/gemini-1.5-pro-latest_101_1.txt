Here's my assessment of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The personality description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field.  The love of nature, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care.  Therefore, the probability is higher.

* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence, problem-solving, and understanding abstract concepts – all relevant to computer science – it lacks specific indicators of a strong affinity for technology or programming. The emphasis on nature and animals makes agricultural and veterinary science a more likely fit. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a brief personality sketch. Many other factors influence a person's choice of field, and it's impossible to determine with certainty based on this limited information.
