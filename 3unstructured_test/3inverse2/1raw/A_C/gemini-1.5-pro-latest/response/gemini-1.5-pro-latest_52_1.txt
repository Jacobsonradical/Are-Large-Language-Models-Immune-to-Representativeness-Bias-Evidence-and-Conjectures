Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a very brief personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work. These traits align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences, making it a more likely field for Adam compared to computer science. 
* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence, problem-solving, and understanding abstract concepts – all relevant to computer science – the lack of any direct mention of technology or programming makes it slightly less probable. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not definitive predictors of someone's field of study. Many individuals with these traits could be drawn to computer science or other fields entirely.
