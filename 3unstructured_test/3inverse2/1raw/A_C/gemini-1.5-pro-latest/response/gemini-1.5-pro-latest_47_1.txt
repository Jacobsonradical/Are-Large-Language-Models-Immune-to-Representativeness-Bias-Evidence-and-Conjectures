Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and an appreciation for hard work often associated with these fields. This makes it more likely Adam was in this field than Computer Science.

* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence, problem-solving, and understanding abstract concepts – traits often associated with computer science – the lack of any direct link to technology or computers makes it less likely. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimations based on limited information. Personality sketches can be general, and many individuals in various fields might fit this description.
