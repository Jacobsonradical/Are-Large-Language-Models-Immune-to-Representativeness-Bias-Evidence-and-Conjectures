Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes the personality sketch might evoke:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes nature, animals, and understanding dedication/hard work (often associated with agriculture). This makes it more likely Adam is in this field.
* **Computer Science:** While high intelligence and puzzle-solving fit the stereotype of computer science students, the other traits are less specific.  It's plausible, but the sketch doesn't point as strongly towards CS. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many individuals in computer science share the described traits, and not everyone in agricultural fields does. 
* Individual personalities are diverse, and field of study is just one factor.
