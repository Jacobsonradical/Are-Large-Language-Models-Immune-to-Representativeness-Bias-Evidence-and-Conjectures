Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Fit with Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love of nature, plants, and animals. This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. The mention of "hard work and dedication" further supports this, as these fields often require those qualities.

* **Possible, but Less Likely Fit with Computer Science:**  While the description mentions "solving puzzles" and "understanding abstract concepts," which are relevant to computer science, the overall emphasis on nature makes it seem less likely.  It's possible for someone to have diverse interests, but based on the provided information, agricultural and veterinary science seem more probable.
