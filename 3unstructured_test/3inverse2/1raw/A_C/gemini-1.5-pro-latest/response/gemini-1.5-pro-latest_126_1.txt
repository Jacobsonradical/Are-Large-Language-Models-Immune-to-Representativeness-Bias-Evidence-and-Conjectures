Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes traits aligning with these fields:
    * "Curiosity about nature and plants" 
    * "Deep love for animals"
    * "Understanding and appreciation for hard work" (often associated with these fields). 
* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions "solving puzzles" and "understanding abstract concepts" which are relevant to computer science, the overall profile leans more towards a nature-oriented and empathetic individual.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid strong stereotyping. Many computer scientists are passionate about nature, and many in agricultural fields excel at abstract thinking. This assessment simply weighs the provided information for a *probable* fit.
