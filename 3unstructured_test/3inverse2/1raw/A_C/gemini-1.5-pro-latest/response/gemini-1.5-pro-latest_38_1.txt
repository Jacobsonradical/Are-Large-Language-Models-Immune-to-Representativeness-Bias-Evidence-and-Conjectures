Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and is not definitive:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  The sketch heavily emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work/dedication. These are all strong indicators of someone potentially drawn to agricultural or veterinary fields. 
* **Computer Science:** While high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are associated with computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators like a passion for technology, programming, or problem-solving within a digital context. The emphasis on empathy and love for living things might suggest alternative interests.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. Many individuals in computer science share the traits described, and many in agricultural fields might not. This is a purely speculative exercise based on limited information.
