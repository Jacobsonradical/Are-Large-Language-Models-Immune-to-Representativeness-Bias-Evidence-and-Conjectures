**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch describes someone who enjoys problem-solving and abstract concepts, which are traits often associated with computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work aligns more strongly with agricultural and veterinary sciences. 

While someone in computer science could certainly share these interests, the described profile makes it seem more likely that Adam's field of study in 2021 was something closer to agricultural and veterinary sciences.
