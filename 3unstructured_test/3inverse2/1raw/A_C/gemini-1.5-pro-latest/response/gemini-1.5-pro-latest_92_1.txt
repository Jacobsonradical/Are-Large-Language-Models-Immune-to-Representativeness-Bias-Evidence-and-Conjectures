Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a very brief personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work are all highly relevant to careers in agriculture and veterinary medicine.  
* **Computer Science:**  While intelligence, problem-solving, and abstract thinking are common in computer science students, the other traits are less specific.  It's certainly possible for someone interested in nature and animals to also be drawn to computer science, hence a moderate probability.
