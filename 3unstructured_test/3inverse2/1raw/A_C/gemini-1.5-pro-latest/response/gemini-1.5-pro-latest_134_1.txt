Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Fit with Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes traits aligning with these fields: 
    * "Genuine curiosity about nature and plants" 
    * "Deep love for animals"
    * "Understanding and appreciation for hard work" (often associated with these fields). 

* **Possible Fit with Computer Science:**
    * "Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles" and "high intelligence...good at understanding abstract concepts" are traits often found in computer science students. 
    * However, the sketch lacks strong indicators specifically related to technology or programming, making it a less likely fit than agricultural and veterinary sciences.

**Important Note:** Personality sketches are not foolproof predictors of someone's field of study. Many individuals with these traits may excel in fields outside of those mentioned.
