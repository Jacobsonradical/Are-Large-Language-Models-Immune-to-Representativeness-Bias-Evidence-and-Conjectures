**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work ("understanding and appreciation for hard work"). This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely field for Adam. 

While someone in computer science can certainly be intelligent, empathetic, and enjoy puzzles, the core aspects of the sketch point more strongly towards a field connected with nature and animals.
