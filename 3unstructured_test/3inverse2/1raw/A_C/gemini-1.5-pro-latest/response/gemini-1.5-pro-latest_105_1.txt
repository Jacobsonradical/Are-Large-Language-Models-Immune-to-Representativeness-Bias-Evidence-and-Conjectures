Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing these careers.  
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" aspect and high intelligence are common in computer science, the other traits (love for animals, nature) are less directly related. It's certainly possible for someone in computer science to have these interests, making the probability lower but not impossible. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong stereotyping. Many personality types can thrive in any field. This exercise is about probabilities based on limited information, not definitive judgments.
