**Explanation:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work ("understanding and appreciation for hard work"). This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely fit than "computer science." 

While someone in computer science can certainly be intelligent and enjoy puzzles, the other traits point more strongly towards a field involving the natural world.
