Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all strong indicators of someone potentially interested in this area. 
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects fit the profile of someone who might enjoy computer science, the other traits are less specifically suggestive of this field.  

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on general personality tendencies.  Many other factors influence a person's field of study, including personal experiences, opportunities, and specific interests within a field.
