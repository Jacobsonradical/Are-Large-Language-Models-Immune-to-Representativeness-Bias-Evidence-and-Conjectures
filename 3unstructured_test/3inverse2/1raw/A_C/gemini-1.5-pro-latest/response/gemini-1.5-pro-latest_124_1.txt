Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is purely speculative based on stereotypes associated with the personality description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things. This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture and veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science:** While someone in computer science can certainly possess the traits described, the emphasis on nature and animals might be less common as primary motivators compared to someone drawn to the more technical, problem-solving aspects of computer science.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid overgeneralizing.  Many individuals in computer science are passionate about nature, and many in agricultural fields may not fit this personality profile at all. This is just a probability estimate based on general tendencies.
