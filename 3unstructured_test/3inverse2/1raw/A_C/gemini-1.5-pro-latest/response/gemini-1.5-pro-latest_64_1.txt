Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** aligns strongly with the description.  The sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, and animals.  A warm heart and empathy are also valuable traits in fields focused on animal care.

* **Computer science** is possible.  Intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and abstract thinking are common in this field. However, the description lacks strong indicators typically associated with a passion for computer science (e.g., technology, coding, software). 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field are incredibly diverse.
