Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and is not definitive:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work (often associated with agriculture). This suggests a higher probability Adam might be in this field. 

* **Computer Science:**  While intelligence and abstract thinking are common traits in computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators like a passion for technology, programming, or problem-solving within a digital context.  

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. Many individuals with these traits could be drawn to various other fields like biology, environmental science, or even creative writing.
