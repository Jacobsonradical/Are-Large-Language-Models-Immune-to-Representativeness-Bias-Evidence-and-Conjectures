**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, empathy, and potentially hands-on work (appreciation for hard work and dedication). These traits align more strongly with fields like agricultural and veterinary science. 

While someone in computer science can certainly possess these traits, the sketch doesn't highlight typical computer science markers like a passion for technology, coding, or problem-solving within a digital framework.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on limited information.  Personality sketches are not definitive indicators of a person's field of study.
