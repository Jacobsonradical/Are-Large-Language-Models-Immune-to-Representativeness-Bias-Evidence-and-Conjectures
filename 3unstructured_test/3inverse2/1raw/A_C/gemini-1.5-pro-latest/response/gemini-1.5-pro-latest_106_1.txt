Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The emphasis on nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work makes this a highly probable field for Adam. 
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects could point towards computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with the field, such as a passion for technology or programming.  The strong affinity for nature makes this field less likely than agricultural and veterinary science. 

**Important Note:** These are simply probabilities based on a brief personality sketch.  People's interests and career choices are complex, and it's impossible to definitively determine someone's field of study based on a short description.
