Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and is not definitive:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work/dedication. These traits align well with fields like agriculture or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science:**  While intelligence and abstract thinking are common in computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators of a passion for technology, programming, or systems.  The presence of empathy and a warm heart might be less common stereotypes associated with computer science, but these are not definitive exclusions.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. Many individuals in computer science share the described traits, and many in agricultural fields may not fit the sketch. This assessment is purely speculative.
