Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work ("understanding and appreciation for hard work"). This makes agricultural and veterinary science a much more likely field for Adam.

* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects hint at traits often found in computer science students, the overall emphasis on nature makes it less likely.  

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many individuals in computer science share those personality traits, and many in agricultural fields may not.
