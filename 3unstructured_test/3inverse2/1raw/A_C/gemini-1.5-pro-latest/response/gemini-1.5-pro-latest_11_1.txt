Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Correlation with Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  This points strongly towards fields like botany, zoology, or veterinary medicine, all falling under agricultural and veterinary sciences.
* **Possible, but Weaker Correlation with Computer Science:** While "solving puzzles" and being "good at understanding abstract concepts" are relevant to computer science, they are not specific enough. These traits can be found in many fields. The sketch lacks strong indicators of a passion for technology or programming often found in aspiring computer scientists.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on limited information.  Many individuals in computer science share traits described, and not everyone in agricultural and veterinary sciences will perfectly match the sketch.
