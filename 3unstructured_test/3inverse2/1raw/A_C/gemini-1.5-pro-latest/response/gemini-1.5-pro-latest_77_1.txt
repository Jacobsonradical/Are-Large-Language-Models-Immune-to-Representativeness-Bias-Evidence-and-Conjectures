**Explanation:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work (appreciation for hard work). These traits align well with fields like agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the probability is higher that the sketch describes Adam if he wasn't in that field, implying he might be drawn to it.

While computer science can involve problem-solving and abstract thinking (traits mentioned in the sketch), the overall emphasis on nature and empathy makes it seem less likely. Thus, the probability is lower, suggesting it's more plausible Adam WAS in computer science if the sketch is NOT about him.
