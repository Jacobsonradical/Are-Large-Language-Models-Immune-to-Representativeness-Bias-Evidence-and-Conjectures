Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a short personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work/dedication (often associated with farming/animal care). This suggests a higher probability Adam might be in this field. 

* **Computer Science:**  While the sketch mentions "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts," which are relevant to computer science, the overall emphasis leans more towards natural elements. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Limited Information:** Personality sketches are insufficient for accurately predicting someone's field of study.  Interests and personality are just one factor among many.
* **Individual Variation:**  Many people with these traits exist in BOTH fields. This assessment is a matter of  relative likelihood, not definitive categorization.
