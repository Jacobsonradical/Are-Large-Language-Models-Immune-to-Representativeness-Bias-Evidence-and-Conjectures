Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work. This aligns well with agricultural and veterinary fields, making the probability higher. 
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking (all relevant to computer science), the strong emphasis on nature and animal love makes it slightly less likely.  

**Important Note:** Personality sketches provide a limited view. Many individuals in computer science share those traits, and many in agricultural or veterinary sciences might not fit the description perfectly. These probabilities are simply educated guesses based on the provided information.
