Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based purely on a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to animals and agriculture. 
* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, there's nothing specifically pointing to a strong inclination towards technology or programming.  The love for nature and animals might even suggest a preference for a field with a more direct connection to the natural world.

**Important Note:** Personality sketches are not definitive predictors of someone's field of study. Many individuals with these traits excel in computer science, and some in agricultural sciences might not fit this description perfectly.
