Here is my estimate for the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch indicates a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and a deep empathy, which aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. While the subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, the overall profile seems to lean more towards agricultural and veterinary science based on the strong connection with nature and animals.
