Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a relatively high probability of around 0.7 that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are somewhat applicable to computer science, but not as specifically as the traits pointing to agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of around 0.4 that Adam was studying computer science based on this personality sketch.
