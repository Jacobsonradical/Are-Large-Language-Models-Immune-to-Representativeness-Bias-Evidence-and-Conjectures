Here is my estimate of the probabilities, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking and intelligence could also fit, though maybe not as strongly.

For computer science, the traits of enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem relevant. However, the other nature and animal-related traits seem less directly applicable to computer science.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on the limited information in the personality sketch. The individual's actual field of study could certainly vary.
