Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, which could fit well with computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy indicates a potentially even stronger fit with agricultural and veterinary science.
