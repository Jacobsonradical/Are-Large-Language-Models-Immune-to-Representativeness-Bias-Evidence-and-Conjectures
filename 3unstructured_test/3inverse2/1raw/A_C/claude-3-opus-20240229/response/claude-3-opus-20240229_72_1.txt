Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals suggests a higher probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. However, the subject's intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also point towards a fairly high probability of being in computer science.
