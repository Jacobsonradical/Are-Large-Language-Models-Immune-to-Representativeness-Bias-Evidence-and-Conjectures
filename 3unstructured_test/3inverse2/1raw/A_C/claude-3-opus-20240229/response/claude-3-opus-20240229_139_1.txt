Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and a love for animals. This aligns more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

The mention of high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles could fit with computer science to some degree. However, the overall description seems to lean more towards an interest in the natural world and animals rather than technology and computing.
