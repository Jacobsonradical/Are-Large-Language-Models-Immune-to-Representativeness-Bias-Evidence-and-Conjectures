Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a higher probability of around 0.7 that they would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

While the subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are traits that could lend themselves well to computer science, the sketch overall seems more focused on an affinity for nature and animals. Therefore, I estimate a lower (but still substantial) probability of around 0.4 that the subject would be enrolled in computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
