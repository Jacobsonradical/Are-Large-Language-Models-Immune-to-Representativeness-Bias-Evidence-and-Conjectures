Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love of nature, plants and animals, as well as empathy, which seem to align well with agricultural and veterinary science. However, it also mentions an aptitude for abstract concepts and problem solving, which could fit with computer science. Given the stronger emphasis on nature and animals, I estimate a higher probability of 0.7 for agricultural and veterinary science compared to 0.4 for computer science, assuming Adam was not actually enrolled in those specific fields.
