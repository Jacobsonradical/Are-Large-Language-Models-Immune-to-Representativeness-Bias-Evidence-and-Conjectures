Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants and deep love for animals suggests a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. The puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are also relevant for computer science, but seem somewhat less prominent in the description compared to the life science related traits, so I assigned a lower (but still substantial) probability to computer science.
