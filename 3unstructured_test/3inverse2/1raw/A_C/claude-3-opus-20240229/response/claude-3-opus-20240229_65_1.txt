Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit well with this field.

While the subject's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts could also suit computer science, the personality sketch does not provide as strong of a direct link to this field compared to agricultural and veterinary science. However, there is still a reasonable probability that the subject could be studying computer science.
