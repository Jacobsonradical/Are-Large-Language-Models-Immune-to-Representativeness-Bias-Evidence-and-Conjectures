Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants and animals, which aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of curiosity, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could also fit with computer science to some degree. However, the overall profile seems to lean more towards an agricultural/veterinary field based on the emphasis on love of animals, plants and nature.
