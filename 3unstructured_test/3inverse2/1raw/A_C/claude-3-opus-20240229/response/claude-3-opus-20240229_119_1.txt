Here is my estimate of the probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a deep curiosity about nature and plants, as well as a love for animals. This fits well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of being good at understanding abstract concepts and having high intelligence could also fit with computer science to some degree. However, overall the description seems to align more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science based on the specific interests and traits mentioned.
