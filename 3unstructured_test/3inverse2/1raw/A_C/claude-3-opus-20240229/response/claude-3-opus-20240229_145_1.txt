Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. 

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science. However, the overall profile seems to lean more towards an interest in the natural world and animals rather than technology.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information. Many other fields of study could also potentially fit this personality profile.
