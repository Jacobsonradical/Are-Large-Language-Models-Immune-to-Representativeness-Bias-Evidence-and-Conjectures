Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals suggests a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. However, the subject's intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also fits well with studying computer science. Therefore, while I estimate a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science, I still assign a fairly high probability to computer science based on the personality description.
