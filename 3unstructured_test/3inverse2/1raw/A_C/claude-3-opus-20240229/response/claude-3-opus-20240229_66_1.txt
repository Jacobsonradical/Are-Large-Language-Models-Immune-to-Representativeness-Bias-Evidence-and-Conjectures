Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science than computer science.

The sketch also mentions being good at understanding abstract concepts and having high intelligence, which could fit with computer science. However, the overall description seems to lean more towards an interest in nature, plants, and animals.

Of course, these are just estimated probabilities based on limited information in the personality sketch. The actual field of study could be something else entirely.
