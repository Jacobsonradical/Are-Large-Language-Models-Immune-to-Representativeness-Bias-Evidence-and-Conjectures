Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of having a curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a higher probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.

However, the traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and being good at understanding abstract concepts are also compatible with studying computer science, so I estimate a moderate probability for that field as well.
