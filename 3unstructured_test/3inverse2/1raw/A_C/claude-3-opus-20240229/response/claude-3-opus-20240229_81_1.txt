Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and an understanding of hard work and dedication, which seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a relatively high 70% probability for that field.

The sketch also mentions being good at understanding abstract concepts and having high intelligence, which could fit with computer science. However, the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to CS. So I estimate a moderate 40% probability for computer science.
