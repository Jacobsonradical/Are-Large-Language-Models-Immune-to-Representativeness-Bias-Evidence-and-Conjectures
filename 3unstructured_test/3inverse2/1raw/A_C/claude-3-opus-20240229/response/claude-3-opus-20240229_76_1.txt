Here is my estimate of the probabilities, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of being good at understanding abstract concepts and high intelligence could also fit with computer science, but the overall description seems to lean more towards an interest in the natural world and animals. Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information in the personality sketch.
