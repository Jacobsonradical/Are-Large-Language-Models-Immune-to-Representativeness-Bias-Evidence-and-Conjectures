Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of empathy and a warm heart also aligns well with these fields, especially veterinary science.

On the other hand, the subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could indicate an aptitude for computer science. However, the personality sketch does not explicitly mention an interest in technology or programming, which are often associated with computer science.

Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, based on the given information.
