Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seems more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than computer science. However, the traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could also fit well with computer science. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science, but still a significant probability for computer science.
