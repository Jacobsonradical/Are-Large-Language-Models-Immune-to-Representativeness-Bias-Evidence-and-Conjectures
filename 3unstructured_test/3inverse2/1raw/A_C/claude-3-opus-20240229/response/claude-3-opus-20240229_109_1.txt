Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and an understanding of hard work and dedication, which aligns well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. However, the sketch also mentions being good at understanding abstract concepts and having high intelligence, which could fit with computer science as well. The probability is higher for agricultural and veterinary science given the specific mentions of nature, plants and animals.
