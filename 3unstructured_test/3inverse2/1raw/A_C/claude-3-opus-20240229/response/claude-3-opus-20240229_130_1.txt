Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

My reasoning:
The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a higher probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts are also relevant to computer science, but seem more directly applicable to agricultural and veterinary science given the other traits mentioned. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
