Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. The ability to understand abstract concepts and high intelligence could fit with either field, but the overall profile seems more aligned with agricultural and veterinary pursuits than computer science, so I estimated a higher probability for that field of study.
