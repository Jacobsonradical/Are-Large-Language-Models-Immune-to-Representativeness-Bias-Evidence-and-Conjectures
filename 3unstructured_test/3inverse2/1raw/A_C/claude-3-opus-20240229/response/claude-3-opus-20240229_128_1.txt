Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree, but the overall profile seems more aligned with agricultural and veterinary pursuits based on the emphasized interests. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
