Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals. This aligns more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Problem-solving skills and understanding abstract concepts could apply to both fields, but the overall profile seems to fit better with agricultural and veterinary science than computer science, based on the details provided.
