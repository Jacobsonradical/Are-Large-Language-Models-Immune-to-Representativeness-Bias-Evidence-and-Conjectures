Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which I believe align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than computer science. However, the strong intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are also compatible with computer science to some degree. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability that the sketch is about Adam if he was in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, but I still assign a significant probability to computer science.
