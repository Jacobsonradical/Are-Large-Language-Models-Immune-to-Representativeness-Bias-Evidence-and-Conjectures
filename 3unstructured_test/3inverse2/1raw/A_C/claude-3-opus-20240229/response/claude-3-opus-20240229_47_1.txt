Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field different from the one in question:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests that the subject has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a deep empathy and love for animals. This aligns well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, even if Adam was not actually enrolled in this field, there is a relatively high probability (estimated at 0.7) that the sketch could be describing someone with interests and traits suitable for this area of study.

On the other hand, the subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could also fit well with the field of computer science. However, the personality sketch places a greater emphasis on the subject's affinity for nature and animals, which is less directly related to computer science. As a result, the probability that the sketch is about Adam, assuming he was not a computer science student, is estimated to be lower (around 0.4).
