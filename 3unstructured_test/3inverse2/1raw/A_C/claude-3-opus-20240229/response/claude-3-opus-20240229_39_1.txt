Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature and plants, as well as their deep love for animals, suggests a strong interest and potential for studying agricultural and veterinary science. Their high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also make them well-suited for computer science. However, the specific mention of their interest in nature and animals leads me to assign a higher probability to agricultural and veterinary science.
