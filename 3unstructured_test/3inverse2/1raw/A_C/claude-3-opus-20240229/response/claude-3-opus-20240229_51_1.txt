Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was actually enrolled in a different field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that this describes Adam if he was actually studying a different field.

The sketch also mentions being good at understanding abstract concepts and having high intelligence, which could fit with computer science. However, the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to computer science. So I estimate a lower 40% probability that this sketch would describe Adam if he actually studied a different field than computer science.
