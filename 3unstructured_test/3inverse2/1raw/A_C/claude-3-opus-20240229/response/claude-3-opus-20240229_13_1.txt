Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

My reasoning:
The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural or veterinary science. So I estimate a relatively high 70% probability the sketch is about Adam if he was in a different field than that.

The traits of enjoying puzzles, high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science. However, the overall emphasis on nature, animals and empathy seems less aligned with typical computer science traits. So I estimate a lower 40% probability the sketch is about Adam if he studied a field other than CS.
