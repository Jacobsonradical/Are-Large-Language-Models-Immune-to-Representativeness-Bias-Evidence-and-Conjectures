Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was actually enrolled in a different field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem to align well with agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a relatively high 70% probability the sketch could be about Adam if he studied in that field.

The sketch also mentions being good at understanding abstract concepts and having high intelligence, which could fit with computer science. However, the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to CS. So I estimate a lower 40% probability the sketch could be about a computer science student.
