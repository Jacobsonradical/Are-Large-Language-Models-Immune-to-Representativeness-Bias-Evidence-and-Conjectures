Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a relatively high 70% probability the sketch is about Adam if he was in a different field than that.

The sketch also mentions being good at understanding abstract concepts and having high intelligence, which could fit with computer science. However, the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to CS. So I estimate a moderate 40% probability the sketch is about Adam if he studied a field other than computer science.
