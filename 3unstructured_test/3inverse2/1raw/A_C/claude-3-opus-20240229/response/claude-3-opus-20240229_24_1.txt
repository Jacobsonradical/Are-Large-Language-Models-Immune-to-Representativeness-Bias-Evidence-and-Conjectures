Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch indicates a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts. This fits well with agricultural and veterinary science. While computer science involves abstract concepts, the other interests are less directly relevant, so I estimate a lower probability for that field.
