Here is my estimate for the probabilities, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align more closely with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, the traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could also fit with a computer science student to some degree, so I did not assign a zero probability to that field.
