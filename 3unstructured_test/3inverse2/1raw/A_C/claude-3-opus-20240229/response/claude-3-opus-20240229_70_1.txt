Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could indicate an aptitude for computer science as well, but the overall description seems more aligned with an interest in the natural world and living things. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of 0.7 for agricultural and veterinary science, and a lower but still significant probability of 0.4 for computer science.
