Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch indicates a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts. This fits well with agricultural and veterinary science. While computer science deals with abstract concepts, the other traits mentioned are less directly relevant, so I assign a lower probability to that field given the personality description.
