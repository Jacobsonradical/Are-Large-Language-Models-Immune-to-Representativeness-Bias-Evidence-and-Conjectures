Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love for animals, an appreciation of nature and plants, as well as strong empathy. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, the sketch also mentions an enjoyment of solving puzzles and an ability to understand abstract concepts, which could fit with a computer science student. So while I believe it's more likely the sketch is of someone in agricultural and veterinary science, I still think there's a decent chance it could describe a computer science student, hence the 0.4 probability for that field.
