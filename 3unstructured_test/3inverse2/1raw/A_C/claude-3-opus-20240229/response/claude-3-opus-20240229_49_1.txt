Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and enjoying solving puzzles. These seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than computer science, though an interest in puzzles and abstract concepts could fit with computer science. Overall, I estimate a higher probability of the sketch being about Adam if he studied agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
