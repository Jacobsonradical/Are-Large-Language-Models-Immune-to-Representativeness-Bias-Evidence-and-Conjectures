Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature and plants, as well as their deep love for animals, suggests a strong affinity for agricultural and veterinary science. Additionally, their dedication and hard work could be well-suited to this field.

While the subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make them a good fit for computer science, their specific interests in nature, plants, and animals are more directly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.
