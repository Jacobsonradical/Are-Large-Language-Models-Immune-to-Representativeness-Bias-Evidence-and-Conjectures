Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, if he was enrolled in a different field than the one specified:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch indicates a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and dedication. This aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science, so I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7 that it could describe Adam even if he was in a different field.

The sketch also mentions high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles. While these traits could apply to computer science, they are less uniquely associated with that field compared to the nature and animal-related interests. So I estimate a lower, but still substantial, probability of 0.4 that it could be Adam if he was in a different field than computer science.
