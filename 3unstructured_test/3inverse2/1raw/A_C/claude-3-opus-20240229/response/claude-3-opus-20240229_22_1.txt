Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Explanation:
The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and an understanding of abstract concepts. This description seems more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.

However, the sketch also mentions enjoying solving puzzles and having high intelligence, which could fit with a computer science student as well. Problem-solving skills and strong analytical abilities are important in both fields.

So while I believe there is a higher probability (0.7) that this personality sketch belongs to someone in agricultural and veterinary science, I still assign a moderate probability (0.4) to computer science, as the description does not rule it out entirely.
