Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature and plants, as well as their deep love for animals, suggests a strong likelihood of studying agricultural and veterinary science. Their high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also lend itself well to computer science. However, the personality sketch overall seems to align more closely with someone pursuing agricultural and veterinary science.
