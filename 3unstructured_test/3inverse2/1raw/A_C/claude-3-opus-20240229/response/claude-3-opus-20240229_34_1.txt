Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants and deep love for animals suggests a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, the subject's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also align with studying computer science, albeit with a lower probability based on the personality description provided.
