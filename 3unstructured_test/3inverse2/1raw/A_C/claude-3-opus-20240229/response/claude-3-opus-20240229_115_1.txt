Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seems to fit well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. At the same time, the description of being good at understanding abstract concepts and having high intelligence could also fit with a field like computer science, though perhaps to a lesser degree than agricultural and veterinary science based on the overall sketch.
