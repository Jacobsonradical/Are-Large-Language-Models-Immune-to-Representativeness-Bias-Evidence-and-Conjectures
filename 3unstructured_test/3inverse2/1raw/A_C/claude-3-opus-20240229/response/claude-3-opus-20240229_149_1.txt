Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a higher probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. The ability to understand abstract concepts and high intelligence could fit with computer science, but the other traits seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary studies. Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information in the personality sketch.
