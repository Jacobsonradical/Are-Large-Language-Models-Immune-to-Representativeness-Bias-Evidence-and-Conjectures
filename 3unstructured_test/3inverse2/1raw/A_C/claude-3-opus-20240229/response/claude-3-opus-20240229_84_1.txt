Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as a deep love for animals. This suggests a relatively high probability that Adam could be studying agricultural and veterinary science, even if that wasn't his actual field of study.

The sketch also mentions high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles. While these traits could apply to many fields, they do suggest some probability that Adam could be studying computer science.

Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information. The personality sketch provides a general sense of the person but doesn't conclusively point to any specific field of study.
