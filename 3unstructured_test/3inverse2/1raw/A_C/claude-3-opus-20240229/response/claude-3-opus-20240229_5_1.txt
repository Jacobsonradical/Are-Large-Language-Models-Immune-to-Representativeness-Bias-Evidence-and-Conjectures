Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication seem to align more strongly with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, the traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with a computer science student. So while I think agricultural and veterinary science is more likely given the overall profile, I wouldn't rule out computer science entirely for this individual.
