Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam if he was enrolled in each of the given fields, based on the information provided:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, as well as a deep love for animals and a strong empathy. These traits seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. 

The sketch also mentions being good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, as well as having high intelligence. While these traits could apply to many fields, they do seem relevant to computer science.

However, without more specific information indicating technical skills or interests directly related to computer science, agricultural and veterinary science seems more probable given the emphasis on nature, plants and animals in the description.
