Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, given the personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem well-suited to agricultural and veterinary science, so I assign that a relatively high probability of 0.7.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could fit well with computer science. However, the overall description seems more focused on an affinity for nature and animals. So I assign computer science a moderate probability of 0.4.
