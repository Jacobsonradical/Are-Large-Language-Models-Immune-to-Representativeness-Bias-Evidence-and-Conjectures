Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on the given information, if Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. However, the sketch also mentions an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, which could fit with computer science. Still, overall, the personality traits seem to more strongly match agricultural and veterinary science if Adam was not actually enrolled in that field.
