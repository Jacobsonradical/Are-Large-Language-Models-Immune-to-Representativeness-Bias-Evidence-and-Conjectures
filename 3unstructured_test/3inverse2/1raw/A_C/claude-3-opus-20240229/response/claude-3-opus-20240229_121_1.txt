Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was actually enrolled in a different field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature, plants, and a love for animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. Problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, and intelligence are also valuable in this field.

While computer science also requires problem-solving, abstract thinking and intelligence, the other traits mentioned like empathy and love of animals and nature are less directly relevant. So I estimate a lower probability that the sketch is referring to a computer science student.
