Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as a deep love for animals. This suggests a relatively high probability that Adam could be studying agricultural and veterinary science, even if he was actually enrolled in a different field.

The sketch also mentions high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles. While these traits could apply to many fields, they do suggest an aptitude for a field like computer science. However, without more specific mentions of technology or programming, the probability is lower than for agricultural and veterinary science.
