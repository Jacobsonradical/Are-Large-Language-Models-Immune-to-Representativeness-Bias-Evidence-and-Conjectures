Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests a person with a strong interest in and connection to nature, plants and animals. This aligns well with someone studying agricultural or veterinary science. The curiosity, empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication also fit that field.

While the sketch mentions high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles which could fit computer science, overall the description seems to more strongly match someone in agricultural/veterinary studies if they are not actually enrolled in computer science. But it's certainly possible for a computer science student to have those other interests and traits as well.
