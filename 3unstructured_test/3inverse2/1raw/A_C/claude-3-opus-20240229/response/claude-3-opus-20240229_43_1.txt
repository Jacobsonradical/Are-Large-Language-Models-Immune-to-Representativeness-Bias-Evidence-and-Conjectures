Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and abstract thinking. This aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science, so I estimate a relatively high 70% probability the sketch is about Adam if he studied a different field.

The abstract thinking and puzzle-solving aspects could fit with computer science too, but the other traits seem less directly relevant. So I estimate a lower 40% chance the sketch is about Adam if he was in a field other than CS.
