Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, which seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than computer science. However, the sketch also mentions enjoying solving puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts, which could fit with computer science. Overall, I estimate a higher probability that this describes someone in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, but there is some chance it could describe a computer science student as well.
