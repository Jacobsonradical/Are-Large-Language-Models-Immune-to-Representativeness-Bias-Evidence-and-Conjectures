Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants and deep love for animals suggests a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. Their ability to understand abstract concepts and high intelligence could also fit well with this field.

While the subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills and ability to grasp abstract concepts could lend themselves to computer science, the sketch does not specifically mention an interest in technology or computing. Therefore I estimate a lower probability for this field compared to agricultural and veterinary science based on the personality description provided.
