Here is my estimate for the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science rather than computer science. 

While the sketch also mentions an enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts which could fit well with computer science, on balance the overall description seems to lean more heavily towards agricultural and veterinary science. Hence I assigned a higher probability to that field versus computer science.
