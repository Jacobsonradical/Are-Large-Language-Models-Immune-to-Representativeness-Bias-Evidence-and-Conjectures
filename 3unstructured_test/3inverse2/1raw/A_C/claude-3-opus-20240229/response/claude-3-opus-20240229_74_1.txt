Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a higher likelihood of studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, the subject's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit well with computer science, so I assigned a moderate probability to that field as well.
