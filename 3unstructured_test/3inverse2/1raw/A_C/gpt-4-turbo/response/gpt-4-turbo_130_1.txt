Based on the personality sketch provided and the information about Adam's different potential fields of study, here are the estimates:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.5"
}

These values are based on the personality sketch's emphasis on a love for nature, plants, and animals which aligns closely with agricultural and veterinary sciences, making it more likely this person would be interested in such a field. The value for computer science is moderate, reflecting that while intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are relevant, they are not as directly related to the specific interests in nature and animals as in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
