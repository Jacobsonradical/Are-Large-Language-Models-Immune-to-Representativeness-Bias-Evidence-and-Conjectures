Based on the personality sketch provided and the characteristics outlined therein, I can estimate the probability that Adam matches the description if he is enrolled in different fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field is closely related to nature, plants, and animals. The personality traits described such as curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and understanding abstract concepts align well with what one could expect from someone studying in this field. Thus, if Adam is studying a different field, the probability that this personality sketch fits him would be lower in comparison to him being enrolled in this field. I will estimate this probability as relatively low.
   
2. **Computer Science**: While the qualities such as high intelligence, enjoying solving puzzles, and good at understanding abstract concepts align with a common perception of a computer science student, the emphasis on a warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals doesn't directly connect to the typical curricular focus of computer science studies. These qualities can certainly exist in a computer science student but are less directly relevant to the field. If Adam is studying a different field, the probability that this personality sketch fits him still needs to be considered moderate due to the intellectual and problem-solving facets mentioned.

Here are the estimated probabilities formatted as requested:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
