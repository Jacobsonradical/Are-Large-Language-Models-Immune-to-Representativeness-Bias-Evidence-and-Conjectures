Based on the personality sketch and the typical interests and skills relevant to various academic fields:

- The mention of a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, as well as a deep love for animals, strongly aligns with fields related to agricultural and veterinary science. These subjects require passion and understanding in these areas.

- Strong empathy, high intelligence, and the ability to understand abstract concepts could indeed fit a computer science student, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence or systems that mimic natural processes, but the explicit connection is somewhat less direct compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Therefore, the estimated probabilities that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming Adam was enrolled in a field other than the one being considered, can be summarized as follows:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.1"
}
