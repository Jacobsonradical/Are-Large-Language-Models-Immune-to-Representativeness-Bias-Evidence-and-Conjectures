Based on the personality traits described in the sketch, we can make an informed estimation about how likely Adam might be pursuing a degree in fields other than the ones mentioned. Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants and a deep love for animals, these traits align very closely with interests typically seen in students of agricultural and veterinary sciences. Therefore, it seems less probable Adam would be enrolled in a field significantly unrelated to these interests.

On the other hand, his traits of enjoying puzzles and having high intelligence suggest a good fit for conceptual and problem-solving fields like computer science, though less directly than his clear affinity for nature and animals suggests a fit for agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Here is the estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricaltural and veterinary science": "0.1"
}

These probabilities reflect a rough estimation where the value closer to 0 indicates a lesser likelihood of the personality sketch describing someone from that field, considering the alignment of personal interests and typical academic fields.
