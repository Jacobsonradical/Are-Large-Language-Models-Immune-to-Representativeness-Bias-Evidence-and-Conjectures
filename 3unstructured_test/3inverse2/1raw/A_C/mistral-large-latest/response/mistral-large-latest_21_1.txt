Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a higher probability that the sketch could be about Adam if he were not enrolled in this field.
- **Computer Science**: While the subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with skills useful in computer science, these traits are less specific to the field compared to the alignment with agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, a lower but still notable probability is assigned.
