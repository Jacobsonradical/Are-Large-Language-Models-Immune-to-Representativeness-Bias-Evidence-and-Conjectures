Explanation:
- "computer science": While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could suit computer science, the personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, plants, and animals. Therefore, the probability is relatively lower at 0.4.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, it is more likely that the sketch describes someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, the probability is higher at 0.7.
