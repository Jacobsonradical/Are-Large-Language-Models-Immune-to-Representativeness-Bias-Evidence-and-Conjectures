{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the higher probability of 0.7.
- While the subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could be applicable to computer science, the personality sketch does not emphasize traits typically associated with this field, such as a strong interest in technology or programming. Therefore, a lower probability of 0.4 is estimated.
