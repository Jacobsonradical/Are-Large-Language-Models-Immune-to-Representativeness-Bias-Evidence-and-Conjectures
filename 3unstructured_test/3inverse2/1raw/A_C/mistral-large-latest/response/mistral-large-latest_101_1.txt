{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding of abstract concepts, high intelligence, and puzzle-solving skills suggest they could be suited to computer science, but these traits are not exclusive to that field, hence a probability of 0.4.
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science, hence a higher probability of 0.7.
