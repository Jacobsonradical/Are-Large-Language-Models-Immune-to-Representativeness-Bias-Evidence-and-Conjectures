  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8

- **Computer Science (0.4)**: While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could suit computer science, the sketch emphasizes his love for nature, plants, and animals, which is less directly related to this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy align very well with these fields, making it a more likely fit.
