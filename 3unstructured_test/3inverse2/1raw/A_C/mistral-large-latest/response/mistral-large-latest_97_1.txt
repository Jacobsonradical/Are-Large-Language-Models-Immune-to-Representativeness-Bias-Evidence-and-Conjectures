Explanation:
- "computer science": The subject's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns with skills useful in computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals makes it less likely that the subject is in computer science, hence a probability of 0.6.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy strongly suggest a good fit with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the probability is higher at 0.85.
