- **Computer Science (0.4)**: While Adam's problem-solving skills and intelligence could align with computer science, the sketch emphasizes his love for nature, plants, and animals, which is less typical of computer science students.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make it more likely that the sketch describes someone in agricultural and veterinary science.
