Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.45
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, making it highly probable.
- **Computer Science**: While the subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could apply to computer science, the sketch's emphasis on nature and animals makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
