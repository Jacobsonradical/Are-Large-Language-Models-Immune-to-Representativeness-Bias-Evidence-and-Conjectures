  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Explanation:
- "computer science": While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could suit computer science, the personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, plants, and animals, which is less directly related to this field. Hence, a probability of 0.4 is assigned.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, this field aligns well with the personality sketch. Therefore, a higher probability of 0.7 is assigned.
