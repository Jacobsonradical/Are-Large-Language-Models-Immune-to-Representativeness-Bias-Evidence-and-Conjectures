  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Explanation:
- The subject's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests they might be suited to computer science, but the personality sketch does not heavily emphasize technological or programming interests, hence a probability of 0.4.
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science, making it a more likely field of study, hence a probability of 0.7.
