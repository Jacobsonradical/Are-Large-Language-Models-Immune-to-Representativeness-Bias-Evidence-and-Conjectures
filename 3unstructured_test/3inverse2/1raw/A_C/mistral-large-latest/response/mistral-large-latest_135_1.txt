  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding of abstract concepts, high intelligence, and puzzle-solving skills suggest a potential fit for computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals makes it less likely that the subject is in computer science, hence a probability of 0.4.
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, there is a higher probability (0.7) that the sketch is about Adam if he were not enrolled in this field.
