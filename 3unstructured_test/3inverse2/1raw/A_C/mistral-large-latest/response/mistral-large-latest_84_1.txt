{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}

Explanation:
- "computer science": While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could suit computer science, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals makes it less likely that this is his field. Hence, a probability of 0.6 is assigned.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, it is quite likely that the sketch is about him if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, a probability of 0.85 is assigned.
