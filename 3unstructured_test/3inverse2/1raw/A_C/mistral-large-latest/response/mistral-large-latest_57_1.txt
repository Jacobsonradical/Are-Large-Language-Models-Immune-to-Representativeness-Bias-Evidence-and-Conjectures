Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.4): While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could suit computer science, the personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and empathy, which are not typically highlighted in computer science.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with these fields. Therefore, there's a higher probability that the sketch is about him if he were not enrolled in these fields.
