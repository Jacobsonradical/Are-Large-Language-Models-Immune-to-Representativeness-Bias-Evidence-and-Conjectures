Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could suit computer science, the sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and empathy, which are not typically the main focus in computer science.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with these fields. Therefore, there's a higher probability that the sketch describes someone in these fields.
