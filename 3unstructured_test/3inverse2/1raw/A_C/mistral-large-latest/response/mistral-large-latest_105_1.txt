  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could align with computer science, the sketch's emphasis on his love for nature, plants, and animals suggests a stronger inclination towards a different field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences. Therefore, there's a higher probability that the sketch is about him if he were in this field.
