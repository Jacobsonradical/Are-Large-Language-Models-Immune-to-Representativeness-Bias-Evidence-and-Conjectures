Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.4): While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could suit computer science, his personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and empathy, which are not typically emphasized in computer science.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with these fields. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits these fields, making it more likely that the sketch could be about him if he were enrolled in these fields.
