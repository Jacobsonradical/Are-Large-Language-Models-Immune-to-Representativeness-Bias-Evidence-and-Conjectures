- **Computer Science (0.4)**: While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could align with computer science, the sketch emphasizes his love for nature, plants, and animals, which are not typically associated with this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, it's more likely that the sketch describes someone in agricultural and veterinary science.
