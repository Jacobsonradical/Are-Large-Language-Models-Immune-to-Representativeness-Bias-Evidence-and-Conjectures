  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with the skills required in computer science. However, the sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals suggests a stronger inclination towards a different field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.85)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, it is highly likely that the sketch is about him if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. These traits are strongly associated with this field.
