Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could align with computer science, the sketch emphasizes his love for nature, plants, and animals, which are not typically the primary focus of computer science.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy suggest a higher probability that the sketch is about him if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, as these interests align more closely with this field.
