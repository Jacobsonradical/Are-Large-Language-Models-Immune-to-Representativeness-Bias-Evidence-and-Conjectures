Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the higher probability.
- While the subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could apply to computer science, the personality sketch seems to lean more towards a nature-related field. Therefore, the probability for computer science is lower but still possible.
