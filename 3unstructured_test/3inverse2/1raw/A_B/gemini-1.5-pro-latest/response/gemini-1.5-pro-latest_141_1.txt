Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, animals, and potentially scientific curiosity. These traits align well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine.  Therefore, the probability is significantly higher.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, management, or other typical business-related areas.  The emphasis on empathy and love for animals might even suggest a less likely fit for certain competitive business environments. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches can be interpreted in many ways, and people's interests and career choices are complex. Many individuals with the described traits could thrive in business administration or other unrelated fields.
