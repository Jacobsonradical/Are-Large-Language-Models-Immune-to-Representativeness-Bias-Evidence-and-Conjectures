Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes traits aligning with this field: love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, understanding of hard work (common in agriculture).  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant to business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, marketing, or management.  

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch. Many individuals in business administration might share some of these traits, and not everyone studying agricultural and veterinary science will fit this description perfectly.
