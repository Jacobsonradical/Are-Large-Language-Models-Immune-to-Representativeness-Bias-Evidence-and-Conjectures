Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are just inferences from a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** aligns strongly with the description.  The sketch emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and potentially scientific curiosity (puzzles, abstract concepts). 
* **Business administration** is less likely. While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, the sketch lacks indicators of typical business interests (finance, marketing, management). 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are insufficient to accurately predict someone's field of study.
* Many individuals in business administration could have the traits described, and not everyone in agricultural sciences will fit this profile.
