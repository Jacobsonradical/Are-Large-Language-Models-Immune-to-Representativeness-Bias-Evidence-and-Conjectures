Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry.  This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely field for Adam. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of interest in finance, marketing, or management. The emphasis on empathy and love for animals doesn't typically align with the stereotype of a business student.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch. Individual interests and career paths are diverse, so these should not be interpreted as definitive judgments about people in these fields.
