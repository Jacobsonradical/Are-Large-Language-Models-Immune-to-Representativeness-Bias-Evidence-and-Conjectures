Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The personality description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field.  Curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work are all traits that would be valuable and likely found in individuals pursuing these studies. 
* **Business Administration:** While some traits (intelligence, problem-solving) are relevant to business, the overall sketch leans heavily towards a more nature-focused and empathetic individual.  It's not impossible, but less likely.

**Important Note:** Personality sketches provide limited information.  Many individuals with these traits could be drawn to business for various reasons (e.g., sustainable business practices). This assessment is based on probabilities, not definitive conclusions.
