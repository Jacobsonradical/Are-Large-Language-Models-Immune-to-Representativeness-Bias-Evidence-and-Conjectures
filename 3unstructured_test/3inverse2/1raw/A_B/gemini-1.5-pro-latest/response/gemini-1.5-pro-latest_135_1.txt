Here's my assessment of the probabilities, based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests an affinity for nature ("genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants," "deep love for animals").  The mention of "hard work and dedication" further aligns with the demands of these fields. This makes it more likely Adam is studying in this area. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving skills are valuable in business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of a passion for business, finance, or management.  The emphasis on empathy and nature makes a business focus less probable.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on limited information. A more complete picture of Adam's interests, experiences, and goals would be needed for a more accurate assessment.
