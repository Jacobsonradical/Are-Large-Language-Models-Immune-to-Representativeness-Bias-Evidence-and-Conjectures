Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch heavily implies an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially scientific thinking ("understands abstract concepts"). This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely fit than "business administration." 

However, it's important to note:

* **Personality isn't destiny:**  People with this personality type could succeed in *either* field. Business administration often requires problem-solving skills and empathy for understanding markets and customers.
* **The sketch is limited:** We lack information about Adam's specific career goals, financial interests, or other factors that might influence his field of study.

Therefore, while "agricultural and veterinary science" is more probable, we cannot rule out "business administration" entirely.
