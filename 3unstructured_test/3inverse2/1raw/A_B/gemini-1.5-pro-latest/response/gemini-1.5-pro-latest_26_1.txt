Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. This aligns well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, management, or marketing. The emphasis on empathy and love for animals might be less common drivers for pursuing a business degree.

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly subjective and based solely on a brief personality sketch. Many individuals with these traits could excel in business or unrelated fields. 
* Actual career choices are influenced by a multitude of factors beyond personality, such as personal experiences, opportunities, and economic considerations.
