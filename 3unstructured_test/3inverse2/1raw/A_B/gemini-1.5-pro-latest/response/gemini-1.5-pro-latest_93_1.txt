**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch heavily implies an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially scientific thinking. This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely field for Adam compared to "business administration". 

While someone in business administration *could* have these traits, they are more conventionally associated with fields focused on the natural world and animal care.
