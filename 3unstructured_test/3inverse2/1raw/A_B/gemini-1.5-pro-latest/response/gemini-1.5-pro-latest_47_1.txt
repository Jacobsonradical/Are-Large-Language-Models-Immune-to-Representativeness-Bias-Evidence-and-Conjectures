Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals. The mention of "hard work and dedication" aligns well with these fields. This makes it more likely Adam would be drawn to this area of study.
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in business concepts, finance, or management. The emphasis on empathy and love for animals seems less central to a typical business administration path.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are subjective and based solely on a brief personality sketch.  Many individuals with these traits could excel in business or choose it for other reasons.
