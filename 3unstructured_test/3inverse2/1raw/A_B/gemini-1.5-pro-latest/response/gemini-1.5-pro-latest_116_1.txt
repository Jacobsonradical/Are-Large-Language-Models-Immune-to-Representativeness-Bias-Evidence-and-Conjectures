**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific pursuits.  

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description aligns well with fields like botany, zoology, ecology, or veterinary medicine.  A love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in these fields.
* **Business Administration:**  While someone in business can certainly possess these traits, the sketch doesn't specifically point to interests usually associated with business like finance, marketing, or management. 

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on a brief sketch. Many individuals in business administration could have these interests, and not everyone in agricultural or veterinary sciences will fit this description perfectly.
