Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description aligns strongly with this field.  The emphasis on nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work all point towards a higher probability of Adam being in this field.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the other traits mentioned (love for nature, empathy) are less central to this field. Therefore, the probability is lower. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective estimation based on limited information.  Personality sketches can offer clues but are not definitive predictors of someone's field of study. Many individuals with these traits could excel in various fields.
