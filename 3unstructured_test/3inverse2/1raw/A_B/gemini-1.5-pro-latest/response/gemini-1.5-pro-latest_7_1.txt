Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" aligns with fields like agriculture and veterinary medicine. This makes it more likely Adam would be in this field compared to business. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, marketing, or management.  

**Important Notes:**

* These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many individuals with this personality type could thrive in business administration.
* Personal interests and experiences beyond this sketch heavily influence career choices.
