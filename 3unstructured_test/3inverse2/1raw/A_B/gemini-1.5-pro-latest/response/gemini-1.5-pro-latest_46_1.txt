Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals. The mention of "hard work and dedication" further aligns with fields like agriculture and veterinary medicine. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, marketing, or management.  

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many individuals with the described personality traits could thrive in business administration.  Similarly, some individuals in agricultural and veterinary sciences might not fit this personality profile.
