**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry.  

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description aligns well with someone interested in this field. Love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work are all relevant. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the other traits are less specific. It's possible, but the sketch doesn't point to it as strongly.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a limited sketch. Many individuals in business administration might share these traits, and not everyone in agricultural and veterinary science will.
