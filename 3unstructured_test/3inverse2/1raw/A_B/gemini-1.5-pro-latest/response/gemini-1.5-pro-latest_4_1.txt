Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes the personality sketch might evoke:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant to business, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and love for animals points away from it.  
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  The description aligns strongly with these fields. Curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are common traits among those drawn to these areas.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Many individuals in business administration may share the described traits, and conversely, not everyone in agricultural or veterinary sciences will fit this personality.
