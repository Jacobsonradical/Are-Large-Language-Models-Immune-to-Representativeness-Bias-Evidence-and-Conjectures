  "business administration": "0.2"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, empathy (animals), and potentially problem-solving (puzzles, intelligence). This aligns well with **agricultural and veterinary science**, hence the higher probability (0.7). 

While intelligence and puzzle-solving could apply to **business administration**, the other traits are less characteristic of that field.  Therefore, the probability is lower (0.2).
