Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all strong indicators of someone potentially interested in this area. 
* **Business Administration:** While someone in business can certainly be intelligent, empathetic, and enjoy puzzles, the core personality description doesn't have the same strong connection to business as it does to agricultural and veterinary science.

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a brief personality sketch.  There's a lot of individual variation within any field of study.
