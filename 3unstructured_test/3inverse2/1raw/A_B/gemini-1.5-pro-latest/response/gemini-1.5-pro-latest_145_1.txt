Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The sketch emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things, which are core elements of these disciplines.
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, marketing, economics, or other typical business-related areas. The emphasis on empathy and a love for nature might be less common drivers for pursuing a business degree. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  People's personalities and career choices are complex. There are many reasons why Adam might choose either field, regardless of this sketch.
