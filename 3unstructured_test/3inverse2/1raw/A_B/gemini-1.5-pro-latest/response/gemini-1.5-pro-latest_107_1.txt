Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with the appreciation for hard work (often associated with these fields), makes it more likely that Adam would be drawn to this area of study.
* **Business Administration:** While someone in business can certainly be intelligent and empathetic, the core traits highlighted in the sketch don't strongly align with the typical image of a business administration student. This doesn't rule it out entirely, hence the 0.3 probability. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch.  Many other factors influence a person's choice of study.
