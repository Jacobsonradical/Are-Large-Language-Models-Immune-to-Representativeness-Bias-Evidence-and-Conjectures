Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. These traits align well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of a business-oriented mindset (e.g., leadership, risk-taking, financial interest).  

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches provide a limited view. Many individuals in business administration might share traits described, just as some in agricultural sciences might not. This assessment is purely based on the probability suggested by the provided information.
