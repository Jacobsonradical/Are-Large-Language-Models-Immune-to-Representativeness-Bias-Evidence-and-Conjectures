Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and understanding living things.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" also fits the image of these professions.

* **Business Administration:** While someone in business can certainly be intelligent, empathetic, and enjoy puzzles, the core elements of the sketch (nature, animals, potentially hands-on work ethic) are less central to the typical image of a business administration student. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on stereotypes.  Many individuals in business administration could easily fit the personality sketch, and some in agricultural and veterinary science might not.  Personality is complex, and people's chosen fields don't always perfectly reflect their interests.
