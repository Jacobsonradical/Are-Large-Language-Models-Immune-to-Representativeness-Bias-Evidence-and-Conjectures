Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work (common in agricultural practices) all point in this direction. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the other traits are less suggestive of this field. The sketch lacks any mention of ambition for leadership, financial drive, or interest in market dynamics â€“ elements often associated with business students. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  People are complex, and there's always a chance Adam's specific interests within these fields, or other passions entirely, could deviate from these probabilities.
