Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things.  This aligns very well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. Hence, the probability is considerably higher.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence, problem-solving, and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of an interest in finance, marketing, or organizational management, which are core to business administration.
