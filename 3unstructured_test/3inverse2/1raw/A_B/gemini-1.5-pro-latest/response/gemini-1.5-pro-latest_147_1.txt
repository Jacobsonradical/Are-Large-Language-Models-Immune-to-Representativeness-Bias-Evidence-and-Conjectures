Here's a breakdown of how the personality traits might relate to the fields and how that influences the probabilities:

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** Strong indicator for agricultural and veterinary science, less so for business administration.
* **Quiet, enjoys puzzles, abstract thinking:**  Could apply to either field. Some areas of business (like finance or data analysis) value these traits, as do scientific fields.
* **Warm heart, empathy, love for animals:**  Slightly more indicative of agricultural and veterinary science, though empathy is important in business too. 
* **Understanding of hard work and dedication:** Applicable to both fields.

**Probabilities:**

Considering the above, here's my assessment:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch leans more towards someone interested in  agricultural and veterinary science due to the explicit mentions of nature, plants, and love for animals. However, the other traits are not exclusive to that field, leaving a reasonable chance Adam could be in business administration.
