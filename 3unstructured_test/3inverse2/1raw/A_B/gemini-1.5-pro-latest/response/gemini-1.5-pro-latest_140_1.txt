**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, empathy, and potentially scientific inquiry.  

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** aligns well with these traits:
    *  "Curiosity about nature and its plants" 
    *  "Deep love for animals"
    *  "Understanding and appreciation for hard work" is often relevant in these fields.

* **Business administration** is less likely: 
    * While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant to business, the sketch lacks indicators of a strong interest in finance, management, or economics. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  People's personalities are complex, and there are individuals in business administration who share the traits described and vice-versa.
