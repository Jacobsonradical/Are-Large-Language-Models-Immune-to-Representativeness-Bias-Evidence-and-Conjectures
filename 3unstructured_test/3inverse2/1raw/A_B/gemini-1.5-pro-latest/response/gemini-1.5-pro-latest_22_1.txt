**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. This aligns more closely with **agricultural and veterinary science**. While someone in **business administration** could have these traits, it's less central to the field.  

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many individuals in business administration could have these traits, and not everyone in agricultural and veterinary sciences would fit this description.
