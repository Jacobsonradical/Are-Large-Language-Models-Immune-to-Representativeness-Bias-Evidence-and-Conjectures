**Explanation:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific pursuits. This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely field for Adam compared to "business administration". 

* **Business administration** often attracts individuals interested in management, finance, and commerce. While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals doesn't strongly align.
* **Agricultural and veterinary science** directly involves working with plants and animals, aligning perfectly with the described interests. The mention of "hard work and dedication" further supports this, as these fields often demand those qualities. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a personality sketch. Many individuals in business administration may share those traits, and not everyone in agricultural and veterinary sciences will fit the description perfectly.
