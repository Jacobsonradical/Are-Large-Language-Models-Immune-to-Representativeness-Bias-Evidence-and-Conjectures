Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and is not statistically rigorous:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes traits aligning with this field: love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, appreciation for hard work (common in agriculture).  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and abstract thinking are relevant to business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business-oriented traits (e.g., leadership, risk-taking, financial acumen).

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are highly subjective. Many individuals with these traits might thrive in business. This assessment simply highlights which field seems *more likely* based on the provided information.
