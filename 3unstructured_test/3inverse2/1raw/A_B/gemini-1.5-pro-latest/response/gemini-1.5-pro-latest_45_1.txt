**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially scientific thinking.  These traits are more aligned with someone studying:

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description directly mentions  "curiosity about nature and its various plants" and a "deep love for animals." This makes a strong case for a higher probability (0.7) that the sketch describes someone in this field.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant to business, the other traits (love for animals, nature, empathy) are not as central to the field. Hence, the probability is considerably lower (0.2).
