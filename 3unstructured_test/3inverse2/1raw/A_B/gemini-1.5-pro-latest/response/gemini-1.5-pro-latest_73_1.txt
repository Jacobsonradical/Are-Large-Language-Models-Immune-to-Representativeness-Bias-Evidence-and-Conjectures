Here's my assessment of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The personality sketch strongly aligns with someone interested in this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to animals and agriculture. 
* **Business Administration:** While the described intelligence and problem-solving skills could be applicable to business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of a business-oriented personality (e.g., interest in finance, leadership, marketing).  

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are subjective and based on general personality stereotypes associated with these fields.  
* Individual personalities within any field are diverse. Many people in business administration love nature, and many in agricultural sciences are drawn to it for practical reasons beyond a deep love of animals.
* The provided information is limited. More details about Adam's specific interests, skills, and experiences would significantly impact the probability assessment.
