**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific pursuits. This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely field for Adam compared to "business administration." 

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** aligns directly with his love for animals, curiosity about plants, and potential interest in scientific understanding. 
* **Business administration**, while a common field, doesn't have strong connections to the sketch.  

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information. It's entirely possible for someone with Adam's personality to thrive in business administration, especially if they're drawn to ethical business practices or environmentally conscious companies.
