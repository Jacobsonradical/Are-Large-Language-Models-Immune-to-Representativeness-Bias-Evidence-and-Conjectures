Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with interests often found in these fields:
    * "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" 
    * "Deep love for animals"
    * Understanding "hard work and dedication" (common in agricultural practices) 

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the other traits are less specific to this field.  A love for nature and empathy for animals are not typical drivers for pursuing an MBA. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on general personality tendencies. There are always individuals who defy stereotypes and excel in unexpected fields.
