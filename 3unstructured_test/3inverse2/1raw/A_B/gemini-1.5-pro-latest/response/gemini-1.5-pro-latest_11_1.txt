Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work (often found in agriculture) all point in this direction. 0.6 represents a significant chance, but not a certainty.

* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and abstract thinking are valuable in business, the other traits are less typical markers for this field.  The sketch lacks mention of typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing. 0.2 signifies a lower probability, but not impossible as individuals in any field can have diverse interests.
