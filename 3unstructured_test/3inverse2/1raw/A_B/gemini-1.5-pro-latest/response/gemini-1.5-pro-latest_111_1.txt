Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are based on stereotypes and the description is limited:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in those drawn to these professions. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the description lacks indicators typically associated with business aspirations (e.g., interest in finance, leadership, markets). 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that personality sketches are not foolproof predictors of someone's field of study. Many individuals in business may share the described traits, and conversely, some in agricultural fields might not.
