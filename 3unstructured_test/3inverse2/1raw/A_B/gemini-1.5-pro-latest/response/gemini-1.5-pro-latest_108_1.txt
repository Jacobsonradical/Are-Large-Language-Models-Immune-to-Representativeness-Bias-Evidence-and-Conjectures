Here's an estimated probability breakdown, considering the personality description:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to animals and agriculture. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving skills are valuable in business, the other traits (love for animals, nature) are less central to this field.  It's possible for someone with these interests to study business, but the description makes it seem less likely. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch. Many individuals with these traits could be drawn to business for various reasons (sustainability focus, family business, etc.).  Conversely, some people in agricultural sciences might not fit this description perfectly.
