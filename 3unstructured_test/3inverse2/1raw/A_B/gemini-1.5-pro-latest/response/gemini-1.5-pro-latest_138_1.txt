Here's my assessment of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The personality sketch heavily emphasizes traits that align well with this field: love for animals, curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work (common in agriculture). This makes it more likely Adam from the description is in this field.

* **Business Administration (0.3):** While some traits like intelligence, problem-solving skills, and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of a passion for business, finance, or marketing.  The emphasis on nature and animals makes it less likely, but not impossible, that Adam would be in this field.
