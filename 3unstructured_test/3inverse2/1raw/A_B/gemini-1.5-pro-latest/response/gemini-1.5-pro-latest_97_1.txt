Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on general stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature. While these traits are not exclusive to any field, they are less traditionally associated with business administration, which often focuses on analytical skills, strategic thinking, and financial acumen. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description aligns strongly with fields like agriculture and veterinary science.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing these areas.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration have deep empathy and love for nature, and many in agricultural sciences might not perfectly fit this description. This assessment is simply based on the provided text and general perceptions of these fields.
