Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  Curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work are all traits valuable to vets and agricultural scientists. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities are useful in business, the other traits are less specific to this field. There's nothing to suggest he wouldn't be interested in business, but the sketch leans more towards a science-oriented individual. 

**Important Note:** Personality sketches are not foolproof predictors of someone's field of study. Many individuals in business administration could share these traits, and not everyone in agricultural and veterinary sciences will perfectly match this description.
