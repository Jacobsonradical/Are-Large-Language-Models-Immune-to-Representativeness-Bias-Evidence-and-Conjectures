Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes the personality sketch might evoke:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence, problem-solving, and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and animals. These traits are not as stereotypically associated with business pursuits.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch directly aligns with this field.  Love for animals, curiosity about nature, and an appreciation for hard work (often found in agriculture) strongly suggest this field is a good fit. 

**Important Note:**  Personality is not a reliable predictor of academic choices. Many individuals in business fields may share the described traits, and many in agricultural sciences may not. These probabilities are simply based on how strongly the description leans towards certain stereotypes.
