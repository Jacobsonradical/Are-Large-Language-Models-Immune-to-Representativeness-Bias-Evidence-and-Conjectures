Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is purely based on the personality sketch and is not statistically rigorous:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** aligns strongly with the described traits: love for animals, curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work (common in agricultural fields).  
* **Business administration** is possible, as intelligence and problem-solving ability are valuable in business. However, the sketch lacks clear indicators of typical business interests (finance, marketing, etc.).

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. Many personality types can thrive in various fields.
