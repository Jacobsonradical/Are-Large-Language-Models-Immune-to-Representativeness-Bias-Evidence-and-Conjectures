Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** aligns strongly with the description.  The sketch emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things. These are core interests for someone in this field. 
* **Business administration** is less likely. While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks indicators of typical business interests (finance, marketing, economics).  The emphasis on empathy and love for nature doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination.

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on a brief sketch.  Many individuals in business administration might have the traits described, and not everyone in agricultural sciences will fit the profile perfectly.
