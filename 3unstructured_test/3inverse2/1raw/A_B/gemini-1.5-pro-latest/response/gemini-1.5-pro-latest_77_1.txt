Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work all point in this direction. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the other traits (empathy, love for animals, nature interest) are less central. It's possible, but less likely given the emphasis in the sketch. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information.  Personality is complex, and people in any field can possess a wide range of traits.
