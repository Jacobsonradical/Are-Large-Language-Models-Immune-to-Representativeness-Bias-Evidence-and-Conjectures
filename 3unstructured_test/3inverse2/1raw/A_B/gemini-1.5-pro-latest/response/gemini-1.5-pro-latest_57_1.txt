Here's an estimated probability assessment based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in these professions. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the other traits (love for animals, nature) are less central. It's possible, but the personality sketch leans more towards a science-oriented individual.

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a brief personality sketch.  Individual personalities within any field are diverse, and this shouldn't be interpreted as a definitive judgment about someone's field of study.
