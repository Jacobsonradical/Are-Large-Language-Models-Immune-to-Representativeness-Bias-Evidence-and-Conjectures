**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely field for Adam compared to "business administration".

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, marketing, or management. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch directly aligns with this field: love for animals, curiosity about plants, understanding of hard work (farming/animal care), and potential interest in scientific study. 

**Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  It's entirely possible for someone with Adam's description to thrive in business administration, particularly if they are drawn to sustainable business practices or similar areas.
