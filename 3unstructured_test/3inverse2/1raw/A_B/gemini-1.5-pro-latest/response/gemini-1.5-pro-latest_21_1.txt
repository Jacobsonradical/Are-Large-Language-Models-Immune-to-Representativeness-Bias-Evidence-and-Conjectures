Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and is highly speculative:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch heavily emphasizes traits aligning with this field: love for animals, curiosity about nature, understanding of dedication and hard work (common in agriculture).  This suggests a higher probability. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant to business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of typical business-oriented interests (finance, marketing, leadership, etc.).  

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study.  Many individuals with these traits might be drawn to business for its own challenges and rewards. This assessment is purely based on the provided information and should not be interpreted as a definitive judgment.
