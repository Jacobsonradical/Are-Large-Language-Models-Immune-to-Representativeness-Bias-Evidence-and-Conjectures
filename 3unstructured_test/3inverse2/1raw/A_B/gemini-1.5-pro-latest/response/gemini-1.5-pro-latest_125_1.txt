**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. These traits align more with **agricultural and veterinary science** than **business administration**.  

While someone in business administration could certainly possess these traits, they are less central to the field compared to a career focused on animals and the natural world.
