Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a brief personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially scientific thinking. This aligns well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of interest in finance, management, or marketing â€“ typical focuses within business administration. 

**Important Note:** Personality sketches are limited. Many individuals with these traits could succeed in either field. This assessment is simply based on the probability suggested by the provided information.
