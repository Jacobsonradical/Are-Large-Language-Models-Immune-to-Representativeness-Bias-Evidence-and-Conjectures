**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. This makes a graduate program in **agricultural and veterinary science** a much more likely fit.  

While intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities are useful in **business administration**, the other traits (love for animals, curiosity about nature) are less central to that field.
