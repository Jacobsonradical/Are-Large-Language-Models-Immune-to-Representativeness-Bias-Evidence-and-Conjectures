Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The sketch emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and potentially scientific curiosity. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant to business, the other traits (love for nature, empathy) are less central to this field.  

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise.  Personality sketches, while potentially insightful, are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. Many other factors (personal interests, career goals, family background) heavily influence educational choices.
