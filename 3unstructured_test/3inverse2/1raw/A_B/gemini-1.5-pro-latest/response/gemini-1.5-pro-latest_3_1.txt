Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals. The mention of "hard work and dedication" aligns well with these fields.  Therefore, the probability is significantly higher.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant to business, the other traits (love for animals, curiosity about nature) are less central.  It's possible, but less likely given the personality description.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many individuals in business administration might share some of these traits, and not everyone in agricultural and veterinary sciences will fit the description perfectly.
