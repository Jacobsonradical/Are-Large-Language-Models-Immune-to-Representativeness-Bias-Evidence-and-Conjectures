```

**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, empathy (animals), and potentially scientific thinking (puzzles, abstract concepts). This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" highly probable.

While intelligence and an appreciation for hard work could apply to "business administration," the core interests described are less aligned, making it less likely.
