Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry.  The mention of "plants" and "love for animals" makes this field highly probable.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are relevant to business, the other traits (love of nature, empathy, appreciation for hard work) are less specific to this field. It's possible, but the description doesn't strongly point towards a business inclination. 

**Important Note:** These are subjective probabilities based on limited information. A personality sketch alone cannot definitively determine someone's field of study.
