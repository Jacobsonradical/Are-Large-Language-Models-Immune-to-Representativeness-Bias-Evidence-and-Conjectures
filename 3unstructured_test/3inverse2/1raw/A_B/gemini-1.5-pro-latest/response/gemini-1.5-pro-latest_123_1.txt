Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a very brief personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. These traits align well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Business administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of interest in finance, management, or marketing. The emphasis on empathy and love for animals might be less common in a typical business-oriented student. 

**Important Note:** Personality sketches offer limited information. Many individuals with these traits could succeed in either field. These probabilities are simply based on the likelihood of the described interests aligning with the field.
