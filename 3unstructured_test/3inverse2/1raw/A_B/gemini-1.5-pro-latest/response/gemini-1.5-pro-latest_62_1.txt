Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals. The mention of "hard work and dedication" further aligns with the demands of these fields. Therefore, the probability is higher.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving skills are relevant to business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests like finance, marketing, or management.  The emphasis on empathy and love for animals might be less common in a business-focused individual. 

**Important Note:**  These are just estimations based on a brief personality sketch.  Many individuals in business fields have a love for nature, and many in agricultural or veterinary sciences have strong business acumen. This sketch doesn't provide enough information for a definitive answer.
