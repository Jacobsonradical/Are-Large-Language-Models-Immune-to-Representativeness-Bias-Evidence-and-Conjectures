Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially scientific thinking. This aligns well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of an interest in finance, marketing, or management.  

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a brief personality sketch.  Many individuals with these traits could thrive in business administration.  Conversely, someone studying agricultural science might not fit this description perfectly.
