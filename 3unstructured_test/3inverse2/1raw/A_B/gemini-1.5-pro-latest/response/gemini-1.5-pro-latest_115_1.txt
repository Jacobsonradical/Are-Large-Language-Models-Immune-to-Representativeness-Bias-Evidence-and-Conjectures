Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field.  Love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in these areas. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are useful in business, the other traits are less specific.  It's possible, but the sketch doesn't point as strongly in this direction. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are subjective.  Many individuals in business administration could have these traits, and some in agricultural fields might not. This is simply an estimate based on the provided information.
