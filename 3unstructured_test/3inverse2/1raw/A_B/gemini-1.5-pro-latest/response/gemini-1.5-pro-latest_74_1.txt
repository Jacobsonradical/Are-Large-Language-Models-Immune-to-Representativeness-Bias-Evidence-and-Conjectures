**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely field for Adam compared to "business administration." 

While someone in business administration can certainly possess the traits described, the specific mentions of nature, plants, and love for animals make a field related to those areas more probable.
