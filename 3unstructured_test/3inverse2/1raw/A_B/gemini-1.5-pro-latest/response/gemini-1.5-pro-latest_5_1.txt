Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some traits like intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and animal love, which are less typical drivers for business students. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description aligns strongly with interests common in these fields.  Curiosity about nature, plant knowledge, animal love, and understanding hard work all fit the stereotype of someone drawn to these areas.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid strong generalizations. Many people in business administration might share the described traits, and many in agricultural sciences might not. This is just a probabilistic estimate based on limited information.
