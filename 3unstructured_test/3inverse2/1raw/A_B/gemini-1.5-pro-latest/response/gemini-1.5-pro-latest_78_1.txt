Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes traits aligning with these fields: love for animals, curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work (common in agriculture).  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant to business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests like finance, marketing, or leadership. 

**Important Note:** Personality sketches are not foolproof predictors of career paths.  Many individuals with these traits might be drawn to business for its intellectual challenges or find fulfillment applying their empathy in fields like social entrepreneurship.
