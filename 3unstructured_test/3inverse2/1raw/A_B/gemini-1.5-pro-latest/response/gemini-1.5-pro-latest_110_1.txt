Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose guidelines based on stereotypes the personality sketch might evoke: 

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant to business, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals is less typical. 
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description aligns well with these fields.  Curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are common traits among those drawn to these areas. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality is not destiny:**  These probabilities are based on very limited information and broad generalizations. Many individuals in business have a love for nature, and many in agricultural sciences are highly analytical.  
* **Individual variation:** There's a wide range of personalities within any field. 
* **Sketch limitations:** The sketch itself is brief and might not capture the full complexity of Adam's interests and aptitudes.
