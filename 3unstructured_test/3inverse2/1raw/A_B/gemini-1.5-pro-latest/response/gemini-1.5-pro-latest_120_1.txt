**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to subjects involving nature, empathy (animals), and potentially scientific thinking (solving puzzles, abstract concepts). 

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** aligns well with almost all the described traits, making it more likely Adam would be in this field. 
* **Business administration**, while a common field, doesn't have strong connections to the personality description. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the other traits point more strongly towards a science-related field.
