Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The emphasis on nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work points towards a person likely drawn to these areas. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant to business, the other traits are less common descriptors for those pursuing business administration. It's not impossible, hence the 0.3 probability, as some individuals in business may have these interests, but they are less central to the field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
