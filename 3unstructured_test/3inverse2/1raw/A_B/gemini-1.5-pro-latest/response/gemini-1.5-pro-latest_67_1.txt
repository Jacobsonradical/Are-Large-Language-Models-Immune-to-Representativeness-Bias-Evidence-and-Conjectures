Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very rough estimations based on personality inferences:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The personality description strongly aligns with interests often found in these fields: love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work (common in animal care and agriculture).
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the description lacks typical business-oriented traits (ambition, leadership, financial interest). It's possible, but the personality fit seems less strong. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality isn't destiny:** People's interests and career paths are complex.  This sketch might not reflect Adam's true academic pursuits.
* **Limited information:** We only have a brief snapshot of Adam. More details would drastically change the probability assessment.
