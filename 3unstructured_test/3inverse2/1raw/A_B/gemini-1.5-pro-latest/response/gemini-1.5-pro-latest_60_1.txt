Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially scientific curiosity.  These traits align well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities are relevant to business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, management, or marketing â€“ typical focuses within business administration. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not foolproof predictors of career choices. Many factors influence a person's field of study, including personal experiences, opportunities, and specific interests within a broader field.
