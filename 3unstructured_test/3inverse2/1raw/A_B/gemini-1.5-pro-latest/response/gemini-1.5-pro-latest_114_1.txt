**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and scientific thinking. This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a more likely field for Adam compared to "business administration". 

Here's why:

* **Curiosity about nature and love for animals:** These traits directly align with the fields of agriculture and veterinary science. 
* **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles:** This suggests an analytical mind, which is valuable in both fields but perhaps more typical in scientific disciplines.
* **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts:** This is applicable to both fields, but scientific fields often demand a higher level of abstract thinking. 

While it's possible for someone with these traits to pursue business administration, the sketch points more strongly towards a field related to nature and science.
