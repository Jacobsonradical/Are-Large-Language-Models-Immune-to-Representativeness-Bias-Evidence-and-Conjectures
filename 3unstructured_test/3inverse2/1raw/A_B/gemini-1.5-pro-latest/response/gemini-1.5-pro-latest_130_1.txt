Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  Love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are common traits among those drawn to these fields. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the description lacks indicators of typical business interests like finance, marketing, or leadership. The emphasis on empathy and nature makes it seem less likely.

**Important Notes:**

* **Individual Variation:** Personalities within any field are diverse. Many business students love nature, and some veterinary students are less outwardly empathetic.
* **Limited Information:** This is a brief sketch. More details about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would drastically change the probability assessment.
