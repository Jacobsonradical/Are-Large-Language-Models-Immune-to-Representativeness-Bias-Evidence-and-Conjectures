Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with interests often found in these fields:
    * **Nature/Plant Curiosity:** Directly relevant to agriculture and animal care.
    * **Love for Animals:**  A common motivator for veterinary studies.
    * **Hard Work/Dedication:**  Agriculture and veterinary work are demanding. 

* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and problem-solving are useful in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of core business interests (finance, marketing, management, etc.).  Empathy and animal love are less common drivers in that field.

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality isn't a perfect predictor:**  Many people with this personality could thrive in ANY field, including business, with the right motivation.
* **Individual Variation:** Adam is just one person. These probabilities represent a general trend, not a guarantee about *him* specifically. 
* **Limited Information:** The sketch is brief. More details about Adam's specific skills, goals, and experiences would lead to a more accurate assessment.
