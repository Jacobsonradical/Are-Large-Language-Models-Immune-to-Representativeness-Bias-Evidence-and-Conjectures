Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with interests often found in these fields: love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work (common in agricultural practices). 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks indicators of typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing.  

**Important Notes:**

* These are just estimates based on a brief personality sketch.  
* Individual personalities within any field are diverse. Many people in business administration might share traits described, and some in agricultural fields might not. 
* Without more information about Adam's specific skills, goals, and experiences, it's impossible to be definitive.
