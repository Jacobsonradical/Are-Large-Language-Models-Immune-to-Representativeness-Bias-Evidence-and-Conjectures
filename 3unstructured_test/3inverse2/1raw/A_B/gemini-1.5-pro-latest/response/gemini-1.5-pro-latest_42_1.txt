Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based solely on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The description strongly suggests someone drawn to natural sciences.  The love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work all fit well with fields like veterinary medicine, animal science, or agricultural research.

* **Business Administration (0.3):**  While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks indicators of a strong interest in economics, finance, or management. The emphasis on empathy and nature makes this field seem less likely.

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality is not destiny:**  People's interests are complex. This sketch might not represent the full picture of Adam's passions. 
* **Graduate studies are specialized:** Even within "business administration" there are sub-fields that might align better (e.g., environmental sustainability in business). The same goes for agricultural sciences.
* **These are just estimates:** Without more information about Adam, it's impossible to be precise.
