Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are just educated guesses based on stereotypes and the provided description:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work/dedication.  These are all traits strongly associated with agricultural and veterinary fields, making it a more likely match. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant to business, the description lacks strong indicators of typical business interests (finance, economics, marketing, etc.).  A love for nature and empathy aren't as common drivers for pursuing business degrees.

**Important Notes:**

* **Individual Variation:**  Personality is complex, and many individuals in business fields may share the described traits.  
* **Limited Information:** We only have a brief sketch. Adam's specific interests within each field (e.g., environmental management in business vs. animal science) would drastically change the probabilities.
