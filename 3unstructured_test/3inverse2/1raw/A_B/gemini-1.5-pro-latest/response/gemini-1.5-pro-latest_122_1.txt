Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry.  The mention of "plants" and "animals" makes this field a much more likely fit. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant to business, the other traits (love for animals, curiosity about nature) are less central to this field. It's possible, but the profile leans more towards a science-oriented individual.
