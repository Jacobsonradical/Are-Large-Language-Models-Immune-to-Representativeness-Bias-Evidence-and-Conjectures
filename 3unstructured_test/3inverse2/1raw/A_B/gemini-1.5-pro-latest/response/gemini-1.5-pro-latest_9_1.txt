Here's my assessment of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely field for Adam. 

While some traits (intelligence, problem-solving) are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of an interest in business, finance, or management. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just probabilities based on limited information. There's no guarantee Adam fits into either stereotype. 
* People are complex!  Someone with this personality could easily thrive in business with the right passions and career choices.
