**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, empathy (animals), and potentially scientific thinking. This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely fit.  

While intelligence and puzzle-solving ability are useful in business, the other traits are less aligned. Thus, the probability for "business administration" is significantly lower.
