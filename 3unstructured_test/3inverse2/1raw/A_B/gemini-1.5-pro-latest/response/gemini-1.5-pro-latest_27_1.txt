**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch emphasizes traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work. These traits are more traditionally associated with fields like agricultural and veterinary science.  

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The described personality aligns strongly with this field. The love for animals, interest in nature, and appreciation for hard work are common traits among those drawn to these areas. Therefore, the probability is relatively low (0.1) that the sketch is about Adam if he was in a different field.

* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the other traits are less directly applicable. It's more likely that someone with these interests would choose a field related to them. Hence, the probability is higher (0.6) that the sketch is about Adam if he wasn't studying business administration.
