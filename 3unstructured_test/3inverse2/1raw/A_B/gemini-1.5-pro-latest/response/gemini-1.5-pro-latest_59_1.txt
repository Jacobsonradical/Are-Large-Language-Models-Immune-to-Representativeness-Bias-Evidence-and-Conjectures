**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific pursuits. These traits align well with fields like agricultural science or veterinary medicine.  Therefore, the probability is high (0.8) that the sketch describes Adam if he wasn't studying this field.

Conversely, the sketch doesn't prominently feature traits typically associated with business administration, such as a strong interest in finance, marketing, or management. While someone with Adam's intelligence could succeed in business, the sketch's emphasis on empathy and nature makes it less likely (0.2).
