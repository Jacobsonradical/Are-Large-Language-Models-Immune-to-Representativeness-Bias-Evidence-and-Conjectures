Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially scientific thinking (curiosity, puzzle-solving, understanding abstract concepts). These traits align well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, management, or other typical business-related areas. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch.  People's interests and career choices are complex. There could be hidden factors that make Adam a great fit for business administration despite the description.
