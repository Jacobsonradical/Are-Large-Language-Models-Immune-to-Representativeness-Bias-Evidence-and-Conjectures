**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely field for Adam compared to "business administration." 

Here's why:

* **"Agricultural and veterinary science"**:  The description aligns well with this field.  Curiosity about plants, love for animals, empathy (important for vets), and appreciation for hard work are all relevant traits. 
* **"Business administration":** While intelligence and problem-solving are useful in business, the other traits are less specific to this field. The sketch lacks indicators of someone drawn to finance, management, or typical business pursuits.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on limited information. There's no guarantee Adam fits neatly into these stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration may share those personality traits, and conversely, some in agricultural and veterinary sciences might not.
