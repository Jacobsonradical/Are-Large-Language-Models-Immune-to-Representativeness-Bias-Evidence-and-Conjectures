Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily leans towards interests aligning with this field: love for animals, curiosity about plants, appreciation for hard work (common in agriculture). 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant to business, the other traits are less specific.  It's possible, but the sketch doesn't point as strongly in this direction.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many individuals with these traits could be found in either field, and other factors (personal goals, family background, etc.) heavily influence career choices.
