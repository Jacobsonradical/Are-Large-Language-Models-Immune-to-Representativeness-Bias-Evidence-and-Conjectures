Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** aligns strongly with the description. The sketch emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  A career path in this field would be a natural fit for someone with these interests. 
* **Business administration** is less likely. While intelligence and problem-solving skills are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests (finance, marketing, etc.).  

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  People's personalities and career choices are complex. There's no guarantee that Adam perfectly fits these probabilities.
