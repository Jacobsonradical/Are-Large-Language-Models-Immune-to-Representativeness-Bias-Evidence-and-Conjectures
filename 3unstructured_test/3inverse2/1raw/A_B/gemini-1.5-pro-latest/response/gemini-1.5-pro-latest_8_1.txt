Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all relevant. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are useful in business, the other traits are less specific to this field. It's possible, but the personality sketch doesn't point as strongly towards business.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information. It's impossible to definitively say what field Adam was in without more data.
