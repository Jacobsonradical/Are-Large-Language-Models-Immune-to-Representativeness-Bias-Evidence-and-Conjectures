Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** aligns strongly with many traits in the sketch:  love for animals, curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work (common in agriculture). 
* **Business administration** is not ruled out. Intelligence, problem-solving skills, and even empathy are valuable in business. However, the sketch lacks strong indicators of a business-oriented personality (e.g., interest in finance, leadership, market trends).

**Important Notes:**

* These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many individuals in business fields might have the described traits, and some in agricultural fields might not.
* A true probability assessment would require a much larger sample size and understanding of the prevalence of these traits across different fields.
