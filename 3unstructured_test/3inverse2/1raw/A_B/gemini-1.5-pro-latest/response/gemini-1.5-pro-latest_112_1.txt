**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry.  This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely field for Adam compared to "business administration."

* **Business administration** often attracts individuals interested in management, finance, and commerce. While intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are relevant, the sketch's emphasis on nature and empathy makes this field less likely.
* **Agricultural and veterinary science** aligns strongly with the description.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work (often found in these fields) all point towards a higher probability. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch. It's impossible to definitively say what field Adam was in without more information.
