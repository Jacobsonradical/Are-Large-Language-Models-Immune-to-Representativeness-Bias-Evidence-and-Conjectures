Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes the personality sketch might evoke:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and puzzle-solving are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and understanding hard work. These traits are not exclusive to business and could be seen as more aligned with fields focused on living things or social impact.
* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description directly mentions "curiosity about nature and its various plants" and a "deep love for animals." These are strong indicators of potential interest in fields related to agriculture, plants, or animal care.

**Important Notes:**

* **Individual Variation:** Personalities are diverse, and many individuals in business fields share traits described. This estimate is a generalization, not a rule.
* **Sketch Limitations:** The sketch is brief. More details about Adam's specific skills, academic performance, or career goals would drastically change the probability assessment.
