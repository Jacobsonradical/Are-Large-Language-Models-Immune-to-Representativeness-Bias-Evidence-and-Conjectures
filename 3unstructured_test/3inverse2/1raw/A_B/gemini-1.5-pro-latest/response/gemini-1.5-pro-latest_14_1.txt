**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry.  This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely field for Adam compared to "business administration." 

* **Business administration** often attracts individuals interested in management, finance, and commerce. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature and animals doesn't strongly align.
* **Agricultural and veterinary science** directly relates to the sketch's description. A love for animals, curiosity about plants, and an appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing these fields.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are based solely on the provided personality sketch and are not definitive. There's significant individual variation within any field of study.
