Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, hence the high probability of 0.8.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be useful in this field, their personality traits such as quiet nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication do not strongly indicate an interest in business administration, hence the lower probability of 0.3.
