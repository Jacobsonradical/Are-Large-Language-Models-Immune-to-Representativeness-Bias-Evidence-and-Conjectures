}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.
- While the subject's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could apply to business administration, these traits are also valuable in agricultural and veterinary science.
- The subject's appreciation for hard work and dedication is applicable to both fields, but the mention of puzzles and nature tips the scale towards a field more directly involved with these aspects, such as agricultural and veterinary science.
