Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the higher probability.
- While the subject's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be useful in business administration, the personality sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with this field, such as leadership, entrepreneurial spirit, or interest in finance or management. Therefore, the probability is lower.
