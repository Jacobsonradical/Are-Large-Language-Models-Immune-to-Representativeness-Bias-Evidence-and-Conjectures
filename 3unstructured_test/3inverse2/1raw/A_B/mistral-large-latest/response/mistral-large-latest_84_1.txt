Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with fields related to agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, there is a higher probability that the sketch is about Adam if he were enrolled in this field.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject is intelligent and appreciates hard work, the sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, strategic thinking, or financial acumen. Thus, the probability is lower.
