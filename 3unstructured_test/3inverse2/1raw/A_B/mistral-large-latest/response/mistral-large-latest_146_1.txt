```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the higher probability.
- The field of business administration is less aligned with the subject's personality traits described in the sketch, but it's still possible, hence a lower but non-zero probability.
