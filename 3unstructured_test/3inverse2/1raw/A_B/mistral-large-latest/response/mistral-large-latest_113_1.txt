  "business administration": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.
- While the subject's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could apply to business administration, these traits are also valuable in agricultural and veterinary science.
- The subject's appreciation for hard work and dedication is applicable to both fields, but the mention of puzzles could lean slightly more towards business administration due to problem-solving aspects in that field. However, this is not strong enough to outweigh the nature-related interests.
