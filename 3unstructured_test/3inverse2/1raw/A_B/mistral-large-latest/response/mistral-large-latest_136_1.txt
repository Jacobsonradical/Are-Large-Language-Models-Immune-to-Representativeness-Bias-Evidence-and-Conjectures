}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.
- While the subject's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could apply to business administration, the other personality traits make it less likely that the sketch is about Adam if he were a business administration student.
