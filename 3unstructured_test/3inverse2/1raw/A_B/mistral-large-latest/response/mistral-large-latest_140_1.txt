Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the higher probability.
- The field of business administration is less aligned with the subject's interests and personality traits as described, hence the lower probability. However, it is not zero because the subject's intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication could also be applicable to business administration.
