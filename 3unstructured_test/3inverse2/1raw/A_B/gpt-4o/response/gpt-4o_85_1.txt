Given Adam's characteristics and background, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and good understanding of abstract concepts are more closely aligned with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet nature and interest in puzzles might also imply a preference for fields that are more introspective and connected to natural studies, rather than business administration, which often involves more extroverted and strategic skills in a corporate context.
