Given the personality sketch, let's analyze the likelihood of Adam pursuing studies in each field, assuming he is enrolled in a different field:

1. Agricultural and veterinary science: Adam has a strong curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, shows empathy and love for animals, and appreciates hard workâ€”all qualities that align with this field.

2. Business administration: This field typically requires skills in leadership, management, finance, and may not align as closely with the specific interests and personality traits described.

Therefore, the probabilities could be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
