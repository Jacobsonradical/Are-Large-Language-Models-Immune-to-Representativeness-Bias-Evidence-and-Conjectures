Based on the personality sketch, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

The subject's characteristics, such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, align more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, while intelligence and puzzle-solving skills might be beneficial in business administration, the specific nature-focused interests and empathy described in the sketch are less directly relevant to that field.
