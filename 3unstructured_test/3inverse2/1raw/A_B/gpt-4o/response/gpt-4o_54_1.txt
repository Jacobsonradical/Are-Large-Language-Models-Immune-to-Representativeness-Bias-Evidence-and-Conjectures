Based on the personality sketch provided, here are my best estimates for the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam if Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature, it is more likely that he would be enrolled in a field closely related to these interests, such as agricultural and veterinary science. Conversely, business administration seems less aligned with his described personality traits and interests.
