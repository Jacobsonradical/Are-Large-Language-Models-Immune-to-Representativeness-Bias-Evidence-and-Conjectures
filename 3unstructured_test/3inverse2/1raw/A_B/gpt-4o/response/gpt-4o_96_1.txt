Given the personality sketch and the details provided about Adam, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}

Explanation:
- The personality sketch describes someone with a deep love for animals, a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits are highly consistent with someone pursuing studies in agricultural and veterinary science, hence the higher probability.
- While the traits of empathy, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts can also be useful in business administration, the specific focus on nature, plants, and animals makes it less likely but not impossible, leading to a lower probability for business administration.
