Given the personality traits described in the sketch, it is reasonable to infer that Adam's interests and characteristics align more closely with a field that involves a deep appreciation for nature, animals, and abstract understanding. Therefore, here's the probability estimate for each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's characteristics seem much more aligned with the field of agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
