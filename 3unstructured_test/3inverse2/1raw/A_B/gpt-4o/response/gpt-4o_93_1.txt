Sure, given the details of the personality sketch and the description of Adam, I'll provide my estimates for the probabilities.

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align more closely with fields related to agricultural and veterinary science. Though it's possible he could be in business administration, his described interests and personality traits make it much less likely.
