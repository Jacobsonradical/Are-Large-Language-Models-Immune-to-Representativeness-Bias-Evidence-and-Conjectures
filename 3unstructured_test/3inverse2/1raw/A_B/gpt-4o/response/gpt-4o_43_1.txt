Explanation:
The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong affinity for nature, animals, and abstract concepts, which aligns well with fields such as agricultural and veterinary science. This field would likely allow him to pursue his interest in nature and animals, making it a plausible fit for his personality. On the other hand, business administration doesn't seem to align well with his expressed interests and empathy towards animals and nature, hence the lower probability.
