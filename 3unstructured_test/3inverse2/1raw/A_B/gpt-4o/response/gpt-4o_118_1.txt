Based on the personality sketch provided, here's an estimate of the probability that the sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than the one in question:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

The high interest and curiosity about nature, plants, and animals make it more likely that Adam could be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, the characteristics described do not strongly align with the typical interests and skill sets prevalent in business administration, leading to a lower probability for that field.
