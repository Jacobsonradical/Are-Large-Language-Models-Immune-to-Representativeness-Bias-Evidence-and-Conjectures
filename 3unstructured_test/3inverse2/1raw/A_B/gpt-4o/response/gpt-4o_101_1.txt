Here is the best estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, considering he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

The high probability for agricultural and veterinary science is due to Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his strong empathy, which align with the traits often found in individuals in this field. The lower probability for business administration is because the personality characteristics described are less typically associated with this field.
