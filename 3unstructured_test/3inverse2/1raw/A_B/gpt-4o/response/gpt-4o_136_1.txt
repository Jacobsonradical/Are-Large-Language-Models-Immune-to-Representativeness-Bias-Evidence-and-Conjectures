Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, here are the estimated probabilities for the fields of study provided:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10
}

These estimates are based on the traits described, such as Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, which align more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His qualities such as empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication do not strongly indicate a direct fit for business administration, hence the lower probability.
