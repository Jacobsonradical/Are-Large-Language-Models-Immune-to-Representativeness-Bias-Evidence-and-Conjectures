Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and empathy for nature, animals, and abstract concepts. This aligns much more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the sketch also mentions an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could apply to many fields including business. So while I think it's significantly more likely the person studies agricultural and veterinary science, I wouldn't completely rule out business administration based on the information provided.
