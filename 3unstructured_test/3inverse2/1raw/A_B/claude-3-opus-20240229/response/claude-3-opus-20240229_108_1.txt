Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, if he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in and understanding of nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The curiosity, empathy and love for animals in particular are traits that would suit this field well.

While business administration requires intelligence and dedication, the other traits and interests mentioned (puzzles, nature, plants, animals, abstract concepts) seem less directly relevant. It's certainly possible for someone with those interests to pursue business, but the overall sketch points more towards agricultural and veterinary science in my estimation, if Adam was not actually in the field mentioned in the question (graduate student in the U.S.).
