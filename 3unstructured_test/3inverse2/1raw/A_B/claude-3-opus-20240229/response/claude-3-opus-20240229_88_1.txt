Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a higher probability of around 0.7 that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science, if he was not actually enrolled in that field.

The traits of high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles have some relevance to business administration, but seem less directly applicable than to agricultural and veterinary science based on the sketch provided. Therefore, I estimate a lower probability of around 0.2 that Adam was studying business administration, if that was not his actual field of study.
