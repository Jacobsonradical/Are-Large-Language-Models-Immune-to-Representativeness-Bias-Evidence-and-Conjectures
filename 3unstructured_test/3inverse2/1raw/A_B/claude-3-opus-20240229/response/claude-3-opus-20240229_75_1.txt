Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and aptitude for natural sciences, plants, animals and abstract concepts. This aligns much more closely with a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the subject's intelligence, dedication and problem-solving skills could also lend themselves to success in business, so I assign a non-zero but lower probability to that field.
