Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in and love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as an appreciation for hard work and dedication. This aligns well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. While it's certainly possible for someone with these traits to pursue business administration, the personality sketch seems to fit more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. Of course, this is just an estimate based on limited information.
