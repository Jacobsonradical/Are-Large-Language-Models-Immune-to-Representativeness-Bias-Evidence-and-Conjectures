Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest and aptitude for agricultural and veterinary science, given the subject's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. Even if Adam was not actually enrolled in this field, his personality seems very well-suited for it.

On the other hand, while the subject's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts could be applicable to business administration, the overall personality sketch seems less directly relevant to that field. Therefore, the probability is estimated to be lower, around 0.3.
