Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, if he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and a curious, empathetic personality. This aligns well with someone who might study agricultural and veterinary science. While it's certainly possible for someone with these traits to study business administration, it seems less likely based on the personality profile provided. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
