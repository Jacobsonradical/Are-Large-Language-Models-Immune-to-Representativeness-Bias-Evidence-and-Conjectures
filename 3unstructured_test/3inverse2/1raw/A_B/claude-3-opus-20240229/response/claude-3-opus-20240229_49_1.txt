Here is my estimate for the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration is less likely given the emphasis on nature, animals and abstract thinking over typical business-oriented traits, but it's still possible, hence the lower but non-zero probability estimate.
