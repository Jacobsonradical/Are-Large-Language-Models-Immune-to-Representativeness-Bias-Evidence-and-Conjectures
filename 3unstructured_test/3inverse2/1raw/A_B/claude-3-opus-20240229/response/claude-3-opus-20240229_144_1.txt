Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, if he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem to align well with someone who might pursue agricultural and veterinary science. Problem-solving skills and abstract thinking abilities could also be relevant in this field.

While business administration requires intelligence and hard work, the other traits mentioned (love of animals, curiosity about plants, etc.) seem less directly relevant. It's certainly possible for someone with those interests to pursue business, but the overall profile seems to fit agricultural and veterinary science a bit better based on the limited information provided.
