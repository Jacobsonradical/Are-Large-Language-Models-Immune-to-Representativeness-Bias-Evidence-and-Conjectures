Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and empathy for nature, animals, and abstract problem solving. This aligns more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, though elements like intelligence, hard work and dedication could apply to both. Without more specific information, agricultural and veterinary science seems a more likely fit based on the details provided.
