Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as their deep love for animals, suggests a higher probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, their high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also be applicable to business administration to some degree.
