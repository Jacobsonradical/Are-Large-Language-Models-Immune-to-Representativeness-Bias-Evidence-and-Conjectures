Here is my estimate of the probabilities, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as their deep love for animals, suggests a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. Their high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also be valuable in this field.

While the subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business administration, their specific interests and personality traits seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.
