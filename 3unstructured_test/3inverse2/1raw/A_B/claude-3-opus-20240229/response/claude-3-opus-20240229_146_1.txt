Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest a relatively high probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration. However, the traits of intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving ability could also lend themselves to certain business fields, so I don't rule that out entirely. But overall, agricultural and veterinary science seems like a more probable fit for the personality described.
