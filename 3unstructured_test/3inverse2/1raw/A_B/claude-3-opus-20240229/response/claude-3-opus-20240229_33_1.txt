Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Based on the description, the subject seems to have a strong interest in and aptitude for agricultural and veterinary science, given their curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. Business administration seems less likely given the subject's quiet demeanor and interests, though their intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend itself to that field as well. The probabilities reflect my assessment that agricultural and veterinary science is a much more likely field of study for this individual compared to business administration.
