Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. Abstract thinking and problem-solving skills are also valuable in this field. So I estimate a relatively high 70% probability the sketch is about Adam if he was in a different field than agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits mentioned are less directly relevant to business administration, though intelligence, hard work and dedication are certainly assets there too. So I estimate a lower 30% probability the sketch is about Adam if he was in a different field than business administration.
