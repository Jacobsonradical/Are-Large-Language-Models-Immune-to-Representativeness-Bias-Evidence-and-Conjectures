Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a higher likelihood of studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit with pursuing graduate studies in business administration, so I have assigned a non-zero probability to that field as well.
