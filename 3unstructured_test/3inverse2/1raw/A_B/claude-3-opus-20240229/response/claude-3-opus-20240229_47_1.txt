Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was not actually enrolled in that field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. So if Adam was not actually in that field, there is still a reasonably high probability (I estimate 70%) that the sketch could be describing him.

On the other hand, the sketch does not mention much related to typical business administration topics like management, finance, marketing, etc. So if Adam was not in business administration, I think there is a much lower probability (I estimate 20%) that this particular personality sketch would be describing him. The traits mentioned seem less aligned with common business student profiles.
