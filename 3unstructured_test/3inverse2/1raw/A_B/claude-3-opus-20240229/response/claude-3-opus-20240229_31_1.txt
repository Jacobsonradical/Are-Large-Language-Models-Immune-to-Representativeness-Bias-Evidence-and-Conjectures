Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. While business administration requires intelligence, abstract thinking and hard work as well, the other traits mentioned are less directly relevant to that field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
