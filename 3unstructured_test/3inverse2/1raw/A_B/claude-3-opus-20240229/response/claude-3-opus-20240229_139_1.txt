Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in and affinity for nature, animals, and scientific concepts. This aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. While it's certainly possible for someone with these traits to pursue business administration, the sketch overall seems more characteristic of someone drawn to animal and plant sciences. So I estimate a significantly higher probability of around 0.7 that it describes an agricultural/veterinary science student compared to around 0.3 for a business student.
