Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest and aptitude for fields related to nature, animals, and abstract thinking. Agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with a curiosity about plants, love for animals, and dedication. Business administration is less directly related to the traits described, though abstract thinking and intelligence could translate well to that field. Therefore, I estimate a significantly higher probability that the sketch describes an agricultural/veterinary science student compared to a business student, given the details provided.
