Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, animals, and abstract concepts. This aligns more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science than business administration. However, the intelligence, dedication and problem-solving skills described could also lend themselves to success in business. So while I assess a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science based on the personality traits, I still assign a reasonable probability to business administration as well.
