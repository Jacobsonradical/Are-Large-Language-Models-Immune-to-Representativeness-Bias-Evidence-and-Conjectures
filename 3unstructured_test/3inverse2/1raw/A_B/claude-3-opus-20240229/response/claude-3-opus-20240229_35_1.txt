Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest and aptitude for agricultural and veterinary science, given the subject's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication which are important in these fields. So I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.7 that this describes an agricultural/veterinary science student.

Business administration seems less likely given the personality traits described, as the sketch does not mention interests or skills commonly associated with business like leadership, entrepreneurship, finance, etc. The abstract thinking ability could be relevant for some areas of business. So I estimate a lower probability of 0.2 for business administration.
