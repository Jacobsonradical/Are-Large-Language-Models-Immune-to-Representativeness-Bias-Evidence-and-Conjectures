Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, plants, animals, and hard work. This aligns well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. While it's certainly possible for someone with these traits to study business administration, the sketch seems to fit more closely with agricultural and veterinary pursuits. The mention of high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could apply to many fields.
