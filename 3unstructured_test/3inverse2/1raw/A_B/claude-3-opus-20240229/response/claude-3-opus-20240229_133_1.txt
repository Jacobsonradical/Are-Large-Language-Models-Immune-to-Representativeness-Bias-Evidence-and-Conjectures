Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in and affinity for nature, plants, and animals, as well as an appreciation for hard work and dedication. This aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. While business administration requires hard work and dedication too, the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to that field. So I estimate a significantly higher probability that this describes an agricultural/veterinary science student compared to a business student.
