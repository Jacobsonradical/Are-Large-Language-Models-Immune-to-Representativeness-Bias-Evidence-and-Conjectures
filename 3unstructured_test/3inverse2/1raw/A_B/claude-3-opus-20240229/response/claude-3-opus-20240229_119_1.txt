Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a different field than the one specified:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy seem to align well with someone who might study agricultural and veterinary science. The high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could apply to many fields.

Business administration seems less likely given the personality description, as it does not mention traits more commonly associated with business such as leadership, competitiveness, or extroversion. However, the appreciation for hard work and dedication could align with business.

Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information. Personality traits alone do not determine what someone chooses to study, and many other factors are involved. The probabilities are not zero for the fields mentioned, but agricultural and veterinary science seems more likely than business administration based solely on the personality sketch provided.
