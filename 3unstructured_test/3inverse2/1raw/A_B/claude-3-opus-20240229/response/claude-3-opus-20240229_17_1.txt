Here is my estimate of the probabilities, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. Their empathy and warm heart also align well with a career focused on animal care.

While the subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be applicable to business administration, the personality sketch does not emphasize traits commonly associated with that field, such as leadership, competitiveness, or entrepreneurial drive. Therefore, I assign a lower probability to business administration.
