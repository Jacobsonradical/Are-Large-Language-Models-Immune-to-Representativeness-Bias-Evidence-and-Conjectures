Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The described individual seems to have a strong interest in and affinity for nature, plants, animals, and hard work. This aligns more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. While business administration requires intelligence and dedication as well, the other traits and interests mentioned seem less directly relevant to that field based on the limited information provided.
