Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a higher likelihood of studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also lend themselves to success in business administration, albeit to a lesser degree than agricultural and veterinary science based on the personality sketch provided.
