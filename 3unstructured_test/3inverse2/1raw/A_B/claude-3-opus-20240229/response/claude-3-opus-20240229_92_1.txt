Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a strong interest and potential aptitude for agricultural and veterinary science. Their intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve them well in this field.

While the subject's intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could translate to success in business administration, their specific interests seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science based on the personality sketch provided.
