Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a relatively high probability of around 0.7 that they would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science if not in their actual field of study.

The traits of high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could lend themselves to business administration to some degree, but the overall personality profile seems less aligned, so I estimate a lower probability of around 0.2 for that field.
