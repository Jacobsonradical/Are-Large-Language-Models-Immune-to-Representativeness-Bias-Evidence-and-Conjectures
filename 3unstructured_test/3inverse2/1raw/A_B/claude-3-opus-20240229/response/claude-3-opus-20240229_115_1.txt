Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in a field other than the one specified:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as an empathetic and caring personality. This aligns more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the sketch also mentions intelligence, abstract thinking, and an appreciation for hard work, which could fit with a variety of fields. So while I estimate a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science, I still assign a non-trivial probability to business administration.
