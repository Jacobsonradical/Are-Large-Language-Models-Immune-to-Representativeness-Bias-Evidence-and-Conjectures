Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a higher probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the subject's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also be applicable to business administration to some degree.
