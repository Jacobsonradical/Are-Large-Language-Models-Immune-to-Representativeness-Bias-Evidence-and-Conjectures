Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also lend itself to business administration, so I have assigned a non-zero probability to that field as well.
