Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants and animals, which aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking ability and intelligence could also fit such a field.

Business administration is certainly possible but less directly indicated by the personality description, so I assign it a lower probability. The curiosity, problem-solving skills and dedication mentioned could be relevant to business, but the overall profile seems to more strongly point to a life science field.
