Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a strong likelihood of studying agricultural and veterinary science. Abstract thinking skills could also align with more research-oriented aspects of this field.

While the subject's intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication are valuable in business, there are fewer direct connections to typical business administration studies in the personality sketch compared to agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a lower, but non-zero, probability for that field.
