Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also lend themselves to success in business administration, hence the non-zero probability for that field.
