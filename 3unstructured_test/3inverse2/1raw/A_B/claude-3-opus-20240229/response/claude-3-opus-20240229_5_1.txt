Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, for each of the given fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, as well as dedication and hard work. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration. However, the other traits like intelligence, problem-solving skills and understanding abstract concepts could apply to a wide range of fields including business. So while I think it's more likely the sketch is of someone in agricultural and veterinary science, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of it being a business student entirely.
