Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a strong fit and interest in agricultural and veterinary science. The personality traits of empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit well with this field.

While the subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to business administration, the overall personality sketch seems more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science based on the specific interests and traits described. However, business administration cannot be ruled out entirely.
