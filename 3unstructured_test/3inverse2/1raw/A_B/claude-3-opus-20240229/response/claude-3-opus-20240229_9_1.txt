Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract thinking. While these qualities could apply to many fields, they seem particularly well-suited to agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration is certainly a possibility for an intelligent, hard-working individual, but the specific interests mentioned align more closely with agricultural and veterinary pursuits. Of course, additional information would be needed to make a more definitive assessment.
