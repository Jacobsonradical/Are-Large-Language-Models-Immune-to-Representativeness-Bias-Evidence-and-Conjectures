Here is my estimate based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. The ability to understand abstract concepts could be applicable to both fields to some degree. However, overall the personality traits seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.
