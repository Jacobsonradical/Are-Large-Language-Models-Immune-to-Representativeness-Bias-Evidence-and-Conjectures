Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, traits like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and problem-solving ability could lend themselves to either field to some degree.
