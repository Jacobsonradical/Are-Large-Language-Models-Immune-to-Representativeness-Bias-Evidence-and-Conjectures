Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of empathy and a warm heart also align well with caring for animals in a veterinary setting.

While the subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to business administration, the overall profile seems more suited to agricultural and veterinary science based on the specific interests and personality traits described.
