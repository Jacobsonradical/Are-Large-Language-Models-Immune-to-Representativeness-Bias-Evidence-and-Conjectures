Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants and animals, as well as an appreciation for hard work. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. 

While business administration requires intelligence and hard work which are mentioned, the other traits and interests seem less directly relevant to business compared to agricultural and veterinary pursuits. So I assign a lower but non-zero probability to business administration.
