Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals suggests a higher likelihood of studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, their intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also lend themselves to success in business administration, albeit to a lesser extent based on the information provided.
