Based on the personality sketch and the details provided about Adam being a graduate student in the U.S., we can estimate the probabilities as follows:

1. The personality sketch describes a person with a strong interest in nature, a love for animals, and strong empathy. This aligns closely with fields related to nature and animals, such as agricultural and veterinary science. The likelihood that Adam is in this field is higher because his interests are closely related to academic areas commonly associated with studying and interacting with nature and animals.

2. Business administration typically focuses on skills like management, finance, and the organizational aspects of companies. While a person with any background could certainly be interested in solving puzzles and have high intelligence (which are traits mentioned in the personality sketch), the specific references to a deep passion for nature and animals do not align as strongly with the typical focuses of business administration.

Given these considerations, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}
