These estimates reflect that the described interests and personality traits such as a love for nature and animals, high intelligence, and a knack for solving puzzles align more closely with fields like agricultural and veterinary science, which directly involve nature and animals, potentially requiring problem-solving skills in natural or biological contexts. On the other hand, business administration, typically focusing on skills such as management, leadership, and financial analysis, seems less directly related to natural curiosities and empathy towards animals, thus the lower probability.
