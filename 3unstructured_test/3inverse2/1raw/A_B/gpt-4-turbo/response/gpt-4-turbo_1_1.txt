Based on the personality sketch which describes a person with a particular affinity for nature and animals, empathy, and a high level of intelligence, the estimated probabilities that this sketch would fit Adam if he were enrolled in fields other than his actual field of study would be:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and deep love for animals align well with this field. Additionally, his intelligence and problem-solving skills would be beneficial here. Thus, the probability that the personality sketch matches Adam if he were in this field is relatively high.
  
For Business Administration:
- While the qualities of strong empathy and problem-solving are also valuable in business, the specific interests in nature and animals mentioned don’t align as directly with business administration. Furthermore, no direct mention of entrepreneurial, financial, or strategic interest reduces the likelihood that this sketch is about Adam if he were studying business administration.

Here are the numerical estimates:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
