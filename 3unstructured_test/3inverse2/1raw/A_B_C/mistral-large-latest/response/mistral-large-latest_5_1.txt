Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field. Hence, a higher probability is assigned.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence could align with computer science, but the sketch's emphasis on nature and animals makes it less likely. Hence, a moderate probability is assigned.
- **Business Administration**: This field seems the least likely given the subject's interests and personality traits described in the sketch. Hence, a lower probability is assigned.
