Explanation:
- "business administration": The subject's interests and personality traits do not strongly align with business administration, hence the lower probability.
- "computer science": While the subject has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which could relate to computer science, there's no explicit mention of interest in technology or computers, hence a moderate probability.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given the subject's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as their empathy and appreciation for hard work, this field aligns most closely with the personality sketch, hence the high probability.
