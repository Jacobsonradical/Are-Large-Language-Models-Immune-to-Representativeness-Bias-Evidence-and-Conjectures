Explanation:
- "computer science": While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could suit computer science, his personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and empathy, which are not typically emphasized in this field. Hence, a moderate probability of 0.4.
- "business administration": Adam's personality traits do not seem to align strongly with business administration, as there's no mention of leadership, management, or entrepreneurial skills. Thus, a lower probability of 0.2.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his strong empathy, this field aligns well with his personality sketch. Therefore, a high probability of 0.7.
