}

Explanation:
- "business administration": The subject's personality sketch does not strongly indicate an interest in business administration. Hence, the probability is lower at 0.2.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given the subject's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as their strong empathy, there is a higher probability that the sketch could be about Adam if he were enrolled in this field. Hence, the probability is higher at 0.7.
- "computer science": The subject's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests a moderate probability that the sketch could be about Adam if he were enrolled in computer science. Hence, the probability is 0.4.
