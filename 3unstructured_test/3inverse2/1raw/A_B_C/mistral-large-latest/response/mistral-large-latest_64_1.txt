Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with skills needed in computer science. However, the sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals suggests a stronger fit elsewhere.
- **Business Administration**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could be applicable, the sketch lacks mention of leadership, management, or business-related interests, making this field less likely.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns most closely with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. These traits suggest a strong fit with agricultural and veterinary sciences.
