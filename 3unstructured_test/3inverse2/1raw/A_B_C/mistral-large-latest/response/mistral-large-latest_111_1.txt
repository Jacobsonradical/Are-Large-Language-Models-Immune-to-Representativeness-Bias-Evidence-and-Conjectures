Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with computer science, hence a probability of 0.6.
- **Business Administration**: While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work could be useful, the sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership or strategic thinking, hence a lower probability of 0.3.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make this field a strong fit, hence a high probability of 0.8.
