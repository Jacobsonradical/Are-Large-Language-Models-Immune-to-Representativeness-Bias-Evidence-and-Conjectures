Explanation:
- "computer science": The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills might correlate with computer science, but the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals makes it less likely that Adam was in this field.
- "business administration": While the subject's high intelligence and understanding of hard work could apply to business administration, the focus on nature, plants, animals, and the lack of mention of leadership, management, or business-related skills makes it less likely.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work align strongly with this field, making it the most likely choice.
