Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with skills needed in computer science. However, the sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals suggests a stronger fit elsewhere.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could apply to business administration, his interests and empathetic nature do not strongly correlate with this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make this field the most likely fit, despite his actual enrollment in a different field.
