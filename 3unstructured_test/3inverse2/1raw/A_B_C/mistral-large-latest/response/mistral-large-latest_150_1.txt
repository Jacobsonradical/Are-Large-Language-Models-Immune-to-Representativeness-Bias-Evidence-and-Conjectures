Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The sketch mentions traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work, which could be relevant in business, but the strong focus on nature, plants, and animals makes it less likely that Adam would be in business administration.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could align with computer science, but the strong emphasis on nature and animals suggests a lower probability compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The sketch's focus on nature, plants, and animals, along with Adam's empathy and love for animals, makes this field the most likely fit.
