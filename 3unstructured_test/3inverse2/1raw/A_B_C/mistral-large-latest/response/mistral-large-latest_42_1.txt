Explanation:
- "computer science": While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could suit this field, his personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and empathy, which are not typically associated with computer science. Hence, a moderate probability of 0.4.
- "business administration": This field is less likely to align with Adam's interests in nature, animals, and puzzles. Additionally, his quiet nature might not be as suited to the often extroverted business world. Thus, a lower probability of 0.2.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": This field aligns strongly with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work. Therefore, a high probability of 0.8.
