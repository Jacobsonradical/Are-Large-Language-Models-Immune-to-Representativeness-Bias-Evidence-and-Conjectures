Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field.
- **Computer Science**: While the subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit this field, the sketch's emphasis on nature and animals makes it less likely.
- **Business Administration**: This field seems the least likely given the subject's interests and personality traits as described in the sketch.
