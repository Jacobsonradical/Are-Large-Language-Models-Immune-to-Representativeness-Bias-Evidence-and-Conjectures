Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The sketch mentions traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work, which could be valuable in business, but the strong interest in nature and animals makes it less likely that the sketch is about a business administration student.
- **Computer Science**: The mention of high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and solving puzzles aligns well with computer science, but the strong focus on nature and animals suggests it's not the most likely field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make this the most likely field related to the personality sketch.
