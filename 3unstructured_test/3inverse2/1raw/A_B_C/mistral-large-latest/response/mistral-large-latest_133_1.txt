Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high probability.
- The subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could indicate a good fit for computer science, but it's not as strong a match as agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business administration seems the least likely fit given the personality sketch, as it does not emphasize the subject's strong connection to nature and animals, or their curiosity about puzzles and abstract concepts.
