Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The sketch mentions a love for nature, animals, and puzzle-solving, which are not typically aligned with business administration. Hence, the lower probability.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a higher probability for this field.
- **Computer Science**: The mention of high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles makes this a plausible field, but not as strongly aligned as agricultural and veterinary science.
