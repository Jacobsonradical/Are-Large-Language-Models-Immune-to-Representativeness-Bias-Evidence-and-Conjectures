Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The sketch mentions a love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which are not typically associated with business administration. Hence, the lower probability.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals, this field aligns well with the personality sketch.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could align with computer science, but it's not as strongly suggested as agricultural and veterinary science.
