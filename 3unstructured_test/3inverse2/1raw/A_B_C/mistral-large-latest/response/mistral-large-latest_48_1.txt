Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The sketch mentions a love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which are not typically associated with business administration. Hence, the lower probability.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, leading to a higher probability.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could fit well with computer science, but it's not as strongly indicated as agricultural and veterinary science.
