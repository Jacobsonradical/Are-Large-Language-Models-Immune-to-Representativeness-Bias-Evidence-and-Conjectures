Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, management skills, or entrepreneurial spirit. Hence, the lowest probability is assigned to this field.
- **Computer Science**: The mention of high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and solving puzzles aligns somewhat with computer science, but it's not a perfect match, hence a moderate probability.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy strongly suggest a fit with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the highest probability.
