Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field. Hence, the high probability.
- **Business Administration**: This field is less aligned with the subject's interests in nature, animals, and puzzles. Hence, the low probability.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could align with this field, but it's not as strong a match as agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, the moderate probability.
