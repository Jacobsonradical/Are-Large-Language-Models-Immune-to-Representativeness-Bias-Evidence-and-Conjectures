Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high probability.
- The subject's quiet nature, enjoyment of puzzles, and high intelligence could align with computer science, but the deep love for animals and appreciation for hard work and dedication are less typical of this field, hence a lower probability.
- The subject's personality sketch provides the least alignment with business administration, as it does not mention traits typically associated with this field, such as leadership, management skills, or entrepreneurial spirit, hence the lowest probability.
