Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could indicate a good fit for computer science, but it's less specific than the alignment with agricultural and veterinary science.
- The subject's qualities do not seem to align particularly well with business administration, resulting in a lower probability.
