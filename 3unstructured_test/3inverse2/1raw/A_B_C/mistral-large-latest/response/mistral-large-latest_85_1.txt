  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences, hence the high probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could fit well in computer science, but the personality sketch doesn't emphasize technological interests.
- Business administration seems least likely given the subject's interests and personality traits, as there's no mention of leadership, management, or business-related skills.
