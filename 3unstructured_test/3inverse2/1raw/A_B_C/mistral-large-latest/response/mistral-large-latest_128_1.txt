Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field. Hence, the high probability.
- **Computer Science**: While the subject enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with an aptitude for abstract concepts, which could relate to computer science, these traits are not exclusively indicative of this field. Hence, a moderate probability.
- **Business Administration**: There are no clear indicators in the personality sketch that suggest an affinity for business administration. Hence, the low probability.
