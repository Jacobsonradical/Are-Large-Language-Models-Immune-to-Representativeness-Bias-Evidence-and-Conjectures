Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences, hence the high probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could indicate a good fit for computer science, but it's not as strongly indicated as the first field.
- Business administration seems the least likely fit based on the personality sketch, as there are no clear indicators of interest or aptitude for business-related topics.
