Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences, hence the high probability.
- The subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well in computer science, but the personality sketch doesn't provide direct evidence of interest in technology.
- Business administration seems least likely, as there's no mention of interest in business, management, or related topics in the personality sketch.
