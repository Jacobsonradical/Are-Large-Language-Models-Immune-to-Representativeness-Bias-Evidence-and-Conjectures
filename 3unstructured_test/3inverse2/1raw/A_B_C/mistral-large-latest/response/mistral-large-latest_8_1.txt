Explanation:
- "computer science": While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could suit this field, his personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and empathy, which are not typically aligned with computer science. Hence, a moderate probability of 0.4.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": This field aligns well with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. Therefore, a high probability of 0.7.
- "business administration": This field seems least aligned with Adam's personality, as it does not emphasize his love for nature, animals, or his curiosity about plants. Hence, a lower probability of 0.2.
