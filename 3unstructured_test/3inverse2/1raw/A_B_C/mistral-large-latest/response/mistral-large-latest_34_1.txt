```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest he might be more inclined towards fields that directly involve these interests.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence could be useful in business, his personality traits such as empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not strongly align with typical business administration interests.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong understanding and appreciation for hard work make him a strong fit for agricultural and veterinary science.
