Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- "business administration": The sketch mentions traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work, which could be found in any field, but the specific interests in nature, plants, and animals make it less likely that Adam is studying business administration.
- "computer science": Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could align with computer science, but his strong interest in nature and animals suggests it's not the most likely fit.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": This field aligns most closely with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, making it the most probable field related to the personality sketch.
