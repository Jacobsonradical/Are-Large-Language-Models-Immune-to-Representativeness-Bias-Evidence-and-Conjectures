Explanation:
- "computer science": Adam's puzzle-solving skills and high intelligence suggest he could be interested in computer science, but his deep love for animals and nature makes it less likely that this is his sole field of study.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": This field aligns strongly with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, making it the most likely field.
- "business administration": While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's little in the sketch suggesting a strong interest in business, making this the least likely field.
