Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high probability.
- The subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could make them a good fit for computer science, but the personality sketch doesn't provide specific indicators for this field, hence the moderate probability.
- The subject's traits do not seem to align strongly with business administration, as there are no mentions of leadership, management, or business-related skills, hence the low probability.
