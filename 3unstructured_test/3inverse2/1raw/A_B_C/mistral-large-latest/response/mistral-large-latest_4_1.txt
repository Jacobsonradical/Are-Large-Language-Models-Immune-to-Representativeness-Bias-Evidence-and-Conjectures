Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- "agricultural and veterinary science": The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field.
- "business administration": The subject's qualities do not strongly correlate with this field, hence the lower probability.
- "computer science": The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles make this field somewhat likely, but not as much as agricultural and veterinary science.
