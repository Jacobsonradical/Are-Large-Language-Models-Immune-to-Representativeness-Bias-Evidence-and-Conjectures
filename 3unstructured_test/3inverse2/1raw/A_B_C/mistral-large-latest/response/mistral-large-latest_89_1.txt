Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the highest probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could relate to computer science, but the personality sketch doesn't emphasize technological interests.
- Business administration seems least likely, given the lack of business-related traits in the personality sketch, but it's still possible.
