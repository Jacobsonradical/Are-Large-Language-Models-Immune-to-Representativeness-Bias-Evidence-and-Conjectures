}

Explanation:
- "business administration": The sketch mentions curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, which are not typically aligned with business administration. Hence, the lower probability.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": The subject's interest in nature, plants, and animals makes this field a strong fit, hence the higher probability.
- "computer science": While the subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts could fit computer science, the sketch's emphasis on nature and animals suggests a lower probability than agricultural and veterinary science.
