Explanation:
- "Computer Science": While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could suit this field, his personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and empathy, which are not typically associated with computer science. Hence, a moderate probability of 0.4.
- "Agricultural and Veterinary Science": This field aligns well with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. Thus, a high probability of 0.7.
- "Business Administration": This field seems least aligned with Adam's personality, as it does not directly relate to his love for nature, animals, or puzzles. Therefore, a lower probability of 0.2.
