Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences, hence the high probability.
- The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could relate to computer science, but it's not as strong a fit as agricultural and veterinary sciences.
- Business administration seems the least likely fit given the subject's interests and personality traits, hence the low probability.
