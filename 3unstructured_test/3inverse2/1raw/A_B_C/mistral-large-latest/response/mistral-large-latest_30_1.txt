Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high probability.
- The subject's intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could fit well in computer science, but the personality sketch doesn't emphasize technological interests.
- Business administration seems the least likely fit given the subject's interests and personality traits, but there's still a small probability due to the transferable skills like hard work and dedication.
