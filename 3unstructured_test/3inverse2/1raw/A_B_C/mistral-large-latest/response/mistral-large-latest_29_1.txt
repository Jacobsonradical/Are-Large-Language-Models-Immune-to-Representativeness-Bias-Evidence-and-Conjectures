Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, hence the higher probability.
- **Business Administration**: This field seems less likely given the subject's interests and qualities, hence the lower probability.
- **Computer Science**: While the subject's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills could apply to computer science, the personality sketch's focus on nature and animals makes this field less likely than agricultural and veterinary science, but still more likely than business administration.
