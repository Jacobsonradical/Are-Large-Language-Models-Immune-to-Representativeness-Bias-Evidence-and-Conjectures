Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.4): While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could suit computer science, his personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and empathy, which are not typically highlighted in computer science.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7): Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, it's highly probable that the sketch could be about him if he were in this field.
- Business Administration (0.2): Although Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, his interests and personality traits as described do not strongly align with business administration.
