Explanation:
- "computer science": While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could suit computer science, his personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and empathy, which are not typically emphasized in this field. Hence, a moderate probability of 0.4.
- "business administration": Adam's personality sketch does not highlight characteristics typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, extraversion, or a focus on management or finance. Thus, a lower probability of 0.2.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, he seems well-suited to this field. Therefore, a higher probability of 0.7.
