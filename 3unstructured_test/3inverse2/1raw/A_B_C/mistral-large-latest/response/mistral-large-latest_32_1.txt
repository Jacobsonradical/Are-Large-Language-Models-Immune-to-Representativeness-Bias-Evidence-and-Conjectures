```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with skills needed in computer science. However, his strong love for nature and animals suggests he might be more inclined towards a different field.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could be assets in business, his personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for nature, and animals, which are less commonly associated with business administration.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make this field a strong fit. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with the demands of agricultural and veterinary science.
