```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,

}
```

Explanation:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: This field aligns strongly with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with these fields.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could apply to business administration, his personality sketch does not highlight typical business-oriented traits such as leadership, extraversion, or a strong focus on management or financial topics.
