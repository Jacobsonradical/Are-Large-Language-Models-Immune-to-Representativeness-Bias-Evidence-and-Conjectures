}

Explanation:
- "business administration": The subject's interests and qualities do not strongly align with business administration, hence the lower probability.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given the subject's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as their empathy and appreciation for hard work, this field seems quite fitting.
- "computer science": While the subject's intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could suit computer science, the personality sketch does not emphasize technological interests, leading to a moderate probability.
