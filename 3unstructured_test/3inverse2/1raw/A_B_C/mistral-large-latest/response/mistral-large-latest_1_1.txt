Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could fit well in computer science, but the personality sketch doesn't emphasize technological interests.
- Business administration seems least likely, given the focus on nature, animals, and puzzles, but there's still a chance Adam could be interested in business.
