Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for nature and animals suggest he might be more inclined towards fields that directly involve these interests.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work are valuable in business, his personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which are less directly related to business administration.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make him a strong fit for agricultural and veterinary science. These traits are highly relevant to this field.
