Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, his strong love for animals and nature suggests that this might not be his primary field of interest.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could be applicable, his interests in nature, animals, and puzzles do not strongly correlate with business administration.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make this field the most likely fit for him.
