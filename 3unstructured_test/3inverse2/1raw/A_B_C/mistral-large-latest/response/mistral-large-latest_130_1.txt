Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, his genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals suggest a stronger fit elsewhere.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: This field aligns closely with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with this field.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's high intelligence could be applicable, his personality traits such as quiet nature, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not strongly correlate with business administration.
