Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, hence the higher probability.
- **Business Administration**: This field seems less likely given the subject's preferences for nature, animals, and puzzles, and there's no indication of interest in business or management topics.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could relate to this field, but it's not as strongly indicated as agricultural and veterinary science.
