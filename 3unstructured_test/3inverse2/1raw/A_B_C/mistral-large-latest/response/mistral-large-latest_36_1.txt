  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation:
- "business administration": The subject's interests and personality traits do not strongly align with business administration, hence the lower probability.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given the subject's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as their empathy and appreciation for hard work, this field seems quite fitting, hence the higher probability.
- "computer science": The subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could make them a good fit for computer science, but the probability is not as high as agricultural and veterinary science due to the subject's strong connection to nature and animals.
