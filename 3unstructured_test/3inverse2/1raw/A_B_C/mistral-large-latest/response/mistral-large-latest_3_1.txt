- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could be applicable, his personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, which are not typically the primary focuses in business administration.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong empathy make this field the most likely fit for his personality and interests.
