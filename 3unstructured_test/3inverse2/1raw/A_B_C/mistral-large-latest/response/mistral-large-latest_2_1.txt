Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, making it the most probable.
- **Business Administration**: This field is less likely given the subject's preferences for nature, animals, and puzzles, and the sketch does not mention any business-related interests.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles make this field somewhat probable, but it's less likely than agricultural and veterinary science due to the subject's strong connection to nature and animals.
