Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, management skills, or entrepreneurial spirit. Hence, the lowest probability is assigned to this field.
- **Computer Science**: The mention of high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns somewhat with traits common in computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature, plants, and animals suggests it's less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with traits common in agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, this field is assigned the highest probability.
