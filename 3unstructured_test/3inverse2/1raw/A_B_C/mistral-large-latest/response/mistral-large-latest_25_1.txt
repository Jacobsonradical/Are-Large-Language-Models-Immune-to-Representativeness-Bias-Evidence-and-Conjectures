  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation:
- "business administration": The subject's interests and qualities do not strongly align with business administration, hence the lower probability.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given the subject's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as their empathy and appreciation for hard work, this field seems quite fitting.
- "computer science": While the subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts could suit computer science, the personality sketch's focus on nature and animals makes this field less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
