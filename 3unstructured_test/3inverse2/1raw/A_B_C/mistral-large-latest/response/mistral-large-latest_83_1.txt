Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, hence the higher probability.
- **Computer Science**: While the subject enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which could align with computer science, the sketch's focus on nature and animals makes this field less likely, but still possible.
- **Business Administration**: This field seems the least likely given the subject's interests and personality traits as described in the sketch.
