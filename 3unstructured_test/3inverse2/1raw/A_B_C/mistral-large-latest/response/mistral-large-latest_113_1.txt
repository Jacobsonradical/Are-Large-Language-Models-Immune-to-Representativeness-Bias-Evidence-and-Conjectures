Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high probability.
- The subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts could fit well in computer science, but the personality sketch doesn't emphasize technological interests.
- Business administration seems less likely due to the lack of mention of leadership, management, or business-related skills in the personality sketch.
