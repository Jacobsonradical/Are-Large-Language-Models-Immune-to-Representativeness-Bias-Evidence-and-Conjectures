Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with skills needed in computer science. However, his strong love for animals and nature suggests this might not be his primary field of interest.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could be useful in business, his personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and quiet activities, which are less typical of business administration students.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work make him a strong fit for agricultural and veterinary science. This field aligns closely with his described interests and personality traits.
