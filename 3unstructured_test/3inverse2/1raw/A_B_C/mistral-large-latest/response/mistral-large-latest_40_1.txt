Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- "agricultural and veterinary science": The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, hence the higher probability.
- "computer science": While the subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit this field, the sketch's emphasis on nature and animals makes it less likely, hence the moderate probability.
- "business administration": This field seems least likely given the sketch, as it does not emphasize the subject's strong connection to nature and animals, nor does it highlight any business-related traits, hence the lower probability.
