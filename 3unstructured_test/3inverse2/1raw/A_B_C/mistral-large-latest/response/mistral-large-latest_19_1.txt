Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high probability.
- The subject's quiet nature, enjoyment of puzzles, and high intelligence could align with computer science, but the strong emphasis on nature and animals makes this less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
- The subject's personality sketch provides the least alignment with business administration, as there are no indications of interest in business or management topics.
