Explanation:
- "Computer Science": Adam's strong intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts make this somewhat likely, but it's not the best fit due to the lack of mention of technological interests.
- "Agricultural and Veterinary Science": This is the most likely fit given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and appreciation for hard work.
- "Business Administration": This is the least likely fit due to the lack of mention of any business-related interests or skills in the personality sketch.
