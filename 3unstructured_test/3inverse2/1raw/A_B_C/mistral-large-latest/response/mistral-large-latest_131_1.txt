Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- "business administration": The sketch mentions traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work, which could be relevant in business, but the strong focus on nature, plants, and animals makes it less likely that Adam would be in business administration.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science, making this the most probable field.
- "computer science": The mention of high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and solving puzzles could fit with computer science, but the strong emphasis on nature and animals makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
