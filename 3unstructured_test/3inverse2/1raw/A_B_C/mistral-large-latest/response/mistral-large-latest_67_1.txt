Explanation:
- "Computer Science": Adam's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he might do well in computer science, but it's not a perfect fit given his strong interest in nature and animals.
- "Business Administration": This field seems the least likely given Adam's personality and interests, as it does not directly align with his curiosity about nature or his empathy for animals.
- "Agricultural and Veterinary Science": This field seems the most likely given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication.
