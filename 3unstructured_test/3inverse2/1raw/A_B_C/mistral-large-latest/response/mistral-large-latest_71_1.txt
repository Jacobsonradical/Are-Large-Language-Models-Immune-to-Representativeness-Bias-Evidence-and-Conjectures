Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, hence the higher probability.
- **Business Administration**: This field is less aligned with the subject's interests and personality traits as described, hence the lower probability.
- **Computer Science**: While the subject's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills could be applicable, the sketch does not highlight a strong interest in technology or systems, hence a moderate probability.
