Explanation:
- "business administration": The sketch mentions traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work, which are valuable in business, but the focus on nature, plants, and animals makes it less likely that Adam would be in business administration.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, making it the most probable.
- "computer science": While the subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with computer science, the focus on nature and animals makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science, but still more likely than business administration.
