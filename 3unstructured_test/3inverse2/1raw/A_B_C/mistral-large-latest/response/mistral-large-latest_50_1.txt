Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high probability.
- The subject's quiet nature, enjoyment of puzzles, and high intelligence could align with computer science, but it's not as strong a fit as agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business administration seems the least likely fit given the subject's interests and personality traits, hence the low probability.
