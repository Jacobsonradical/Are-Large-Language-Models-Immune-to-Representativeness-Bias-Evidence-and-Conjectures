Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, making it the most likely match.
- **Business Administration**: This field seems the least likely match given the subject's preferences for nature, animals, and puzzles, and no business-related interests were mentioned.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could make them a good fit for computer science, but it's less likely than agricultural and veterinary science due to the lack of mention of technological interests.
