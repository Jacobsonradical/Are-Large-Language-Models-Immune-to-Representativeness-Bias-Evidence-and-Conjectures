Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The sketch mentions traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work, which could be applicable to any field, but the specific interests in nature, plants, and animals make it less likely that Adam would be in business administration.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science, but his strong interest in nature and animals suggests this might not be his primary field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals, this field seems the most likely fit for him.
