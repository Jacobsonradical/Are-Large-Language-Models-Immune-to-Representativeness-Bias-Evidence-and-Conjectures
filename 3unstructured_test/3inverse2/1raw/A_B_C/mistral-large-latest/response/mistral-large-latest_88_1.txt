Explanation:

- "agricultural and veterinary science": This field aligns strongly with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. Thus, a high probability of 0.7.
- "business administration": Although Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's little in his personality sketch that suggests an interest in business. Hence, a lower probability of 0.2.
