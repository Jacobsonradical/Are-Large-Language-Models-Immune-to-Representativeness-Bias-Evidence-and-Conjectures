Explanation:
- "business administration": The subject's interests and personality traits do not strongly align with business administration, hence the lower probability.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given the subject's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as their appreciation for hard work and dedication, there is a high probability that the sketch could be about Adam if he were in this field.
- "computer science": The subject's puzzle-solving skills and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a moderate probability for computer science, but it's not as strongly indicated as agricultural and veterinary science.
