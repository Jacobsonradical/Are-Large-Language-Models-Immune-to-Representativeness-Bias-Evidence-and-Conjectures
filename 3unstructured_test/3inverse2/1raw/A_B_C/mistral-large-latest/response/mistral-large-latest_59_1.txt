Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest that he might be more inclined towards fields that directly involve these interests.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence could be applicable to business administration, his personality traits such as empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not strongly correlate with this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make it highly likely that the sketch is about him if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
