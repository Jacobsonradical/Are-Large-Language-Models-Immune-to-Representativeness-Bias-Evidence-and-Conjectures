Explanation:
- "Business administration": The sketch mentions curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, but it doesn't have many indicators related to business or management, hence the lower probability.
- "Computer science": The subject's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could relate to computer science, but it's not as strongly indicated as the next field, hence a moderate probability.
- "Agricultural and veterinary science": This field aligns most closely with the subject's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, hence the highest probability.
