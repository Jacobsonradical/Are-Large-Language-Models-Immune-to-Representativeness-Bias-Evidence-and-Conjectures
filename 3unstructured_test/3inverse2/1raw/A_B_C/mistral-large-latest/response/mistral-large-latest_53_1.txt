}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could indicate a good fit for computer science, but it's not as strong a match as agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business administration seems the least likely fit based on the personality sketch, as there are no clear indicators of interest or aptitude for business-related topics.
