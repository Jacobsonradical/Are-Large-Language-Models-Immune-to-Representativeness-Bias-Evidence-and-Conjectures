Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, his genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals suggest that his primary interests might lie elsewhere.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: This field aligns strongly with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with these fields.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's high intelligence could be applicable in business administration, his personality traits such as his quiet nature, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not strongly correlate with this field.
