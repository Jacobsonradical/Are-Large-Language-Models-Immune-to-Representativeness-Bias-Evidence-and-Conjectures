Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with skills needed in computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature suggests a stronger fit elsewhere.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence could be applicable, his personality traits such as empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not strongly correlate with typical business administration traits.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make this field a highly likely fit.
