Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, the sketch's emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy suggests that this might not be the best fit.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could apply to business administration, his personality sketch leans more towards fields that involve nature, animals, and empathy, rather than business-oriented topics.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8)**: This field aligns very well with Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his strong empathy. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with these fields.
