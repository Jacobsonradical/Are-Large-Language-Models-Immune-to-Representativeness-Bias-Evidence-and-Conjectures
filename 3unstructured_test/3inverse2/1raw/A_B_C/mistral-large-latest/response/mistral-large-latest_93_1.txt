Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills needed in computer science. However, his strong love for animals and nature suggests that his primary interests might lie elsewhere.
- **Business Administration**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could be beneficial in business, his personality sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, strategic thinking, or financial acumen.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make it highly likely that the sketch is about him if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. These traits are strongly aligned with the field.
