Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest he might be more inclined towards fields directly related to these interests.
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could be assets in business administration, his quiet nature, love for animals, and curiosity about nature make this field less likely to be his primary interest.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong empathy make this field highly probable. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with the demands of agricultural and veterinary science.
