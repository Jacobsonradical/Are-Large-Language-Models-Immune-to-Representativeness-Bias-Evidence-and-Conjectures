Explanation:
- "business administration": The subject's personality sketch does not strongly indicate an interest in business administration. Hence, the lower probability of 0.2.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given the subject's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as their strong empathy, there is a higher probability of 0.7 that the sketch could be about Adam if he were enrolled in this field.
- "computer science": The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests a moderate probability of 0.4 that the sketch could be about Adam if he were enrolled in computer science.
