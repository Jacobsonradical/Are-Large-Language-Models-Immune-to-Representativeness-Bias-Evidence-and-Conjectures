Explanation:
- "computer science": While Adam's problem-solving skills and high intelligence could suit this field, his personality sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and empathy, which are not typically associated with computer science. Hence, a probability of 0.4.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": This field aligns well with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work. Hence, a higher probability of 0.7.
- "business administration": This field seems least aligned with Adam's personality, as it does not directly involve his love for nature, animals, or puzzles. Hence, a lower probability of 0.2.
