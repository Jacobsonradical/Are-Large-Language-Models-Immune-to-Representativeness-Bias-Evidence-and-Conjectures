{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation:
- "business administration": The subject's personality sketch does not strongly indicate an interest in business administration. Hence, the probability is lower at 0.2.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given the subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, there is a higher probability that the sketch could be about Adam if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, the probability is higher at 0.7.
- "computer science": The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could align with an interest in computer science. However, it is not as strongly indicated as agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, the probability is moderate at 0.4.
