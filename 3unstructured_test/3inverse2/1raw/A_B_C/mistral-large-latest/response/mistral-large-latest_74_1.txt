  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could indicate a good fit for computer science, but the personality sketch does not emphasize technological interests.
- Business administration is less likely given the emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy, but it is not entirely impossible, hence a low but non-zero probability.
