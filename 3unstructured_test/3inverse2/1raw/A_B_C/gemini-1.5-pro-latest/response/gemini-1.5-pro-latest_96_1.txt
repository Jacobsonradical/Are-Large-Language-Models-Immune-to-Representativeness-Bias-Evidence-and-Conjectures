Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality description:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  While the "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence could point towards computer science, the description lacks the typical markers of a strong interest in technology, programming, or digital systems often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** This field has the weakest connection to the description. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the other traits are less indicative of someone drawn to this field. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimations based on general personality tendencies. There are always exceptions, and many individuals in each field possess diverse interests and skills.
