Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality description:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with an appreciation for hard work (often associated with these fields), makes it the most likely area of study for someone with these traits. 
* **Computer Science:**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and affinity for abstract concepts align well with computer science. While not as strong a connection as the first field, it's still a plausible match.
* **Business Administration:** This field is least likely.  The personality sketch lacks clear indicators of typical business interests (finance, marketing, etc.). While someone with these traits *could* study business, it's less probable based on the information provided. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on stereotypes.  Individual personalities are diverse, and many people in one field share traits commonly associated with another.
