Here's an estimated probability breakdown, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  A love for nature, plants, and animals, combined with empathy and intelligence, makes this a very likely fit for Adam. 
* **Business administration:** The description doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business. While intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities are useful in business, the other traits point more towards a science-oriented field.
* **Computer science:** This field is a bit trickier. The  "puzzles" aspect and intelligence could indicate an aptitude for programming. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy makes this less likely than agricultural/veterinary science. 

**Important Note:** This is just a probabilistic assessment based on a brief sketch. Individual interests and career choices are complex, and it's impossible to definitively say what field Adam pursued without more information.
