Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  A love for nature, plants, and animals, coupled with intelligence and appreciation for hard work, makes this a highly probable match. 

* **Computer Science (0.4):** The puzzle-solving ability and aptitude for abstract concepts are common traits in computer science students. However, the sketch lacks a strong indicator of a passion for technology or programming, making it a moderate probability.

* **Business Administration (0.1):** This field has the lowest probability. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes traits more aligned with scientific or nature-oriented fields.
