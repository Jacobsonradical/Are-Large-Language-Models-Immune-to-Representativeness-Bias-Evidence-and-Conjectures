Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the description could fit students in any of these fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work/dedication. This aligns strongly with stereotypes of individuals in this field, making it the most likely. 
* **Computer Science:**  The "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects fit the profile of someone interested in computer science, but the lack of direct mentions of technology makes it less likely than agricultural science.
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely given the description. The personality sketch lacks traits often associated with business aspirations, such as leadership, ambition, or a focus on financial success. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember these are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes.  People are diverse, and a person fitting this description could thrive in any of these fields.
