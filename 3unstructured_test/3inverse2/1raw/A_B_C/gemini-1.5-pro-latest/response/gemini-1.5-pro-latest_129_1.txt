Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on personality stereotypes and the information provided is not definitive:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** The sketch heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. These traits are strong indicators of someone potentially interested in agricultural or veterinary fields. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):** The description mentions "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts," which are common traits among those in computer science. However, the lack of direct mention of technology or programming makes it less certain than agricultural and veterinary science.
* **Business Administration (0.2):**  There's little in the sketch to suggest an inclination towards business administration.  While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, the other traits point more strongly towards other fields. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise.  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of career choices. Many other factors, such as personal experiences, opportunities, and skills, influence a person's field of study.
