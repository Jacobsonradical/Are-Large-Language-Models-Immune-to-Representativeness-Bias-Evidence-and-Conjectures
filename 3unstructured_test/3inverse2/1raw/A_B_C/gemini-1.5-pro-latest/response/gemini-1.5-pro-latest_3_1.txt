Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The description of being good at puzzles and understanding abstract concepts is common among those in computer science. However, the other traits (love for animals, nature) are not as strong of indicators. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the other traits are not typical indicators of someone drawn to this field. There's less in the sketch to suggest a strong interest in business concepts.
