Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The sketch strongly emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding dedication/hard work. These traits align very well with someone interested in agriculture or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  Puzzle-solving abilities and intelligence are common in computer science students. However, the sketch lacks strong indicators of a passion for technology or abstract systems that are often driving forces for this field.
* **Business Administration (0.2):** This profile shows little direct correlation with common interests in business administration, such as leadership, finance, or marketing.  While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, they aren't as uniquely suggestive as the other traits mentioned. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just educated guesses based on broad stereotypes.  Personality sketches can offer hints, but individual interests are diverse and complex.
