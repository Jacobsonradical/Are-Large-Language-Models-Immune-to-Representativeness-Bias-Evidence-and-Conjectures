Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.5"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This strongly suggests a higher probability Adam is in this field. 
* **Computer Science:**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and mention of "abstract concepts" align well with computer science.  However, the lack of any direct mention of technology makes it less likely than agricultural science.
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch provides little to connect Adam to business.  While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, they aren't specific indicators, making this the least likely field based on the information.
