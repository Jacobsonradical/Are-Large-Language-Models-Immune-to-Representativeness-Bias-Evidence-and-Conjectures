Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "computer science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.25"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific understanding of these areas. This makes agricultural and veterinary science highly likely.
* **Computer Science:** While the profile mentions puzzle-solving and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, it lacks strong indicators like a passion for technology or programming. It's possible, hence a moderate probability. 
* **Business Administration:** This field is less aligned with the personality description. The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, which are not as central to typical business administration stereotypes. Therefore, the probability is lower.
