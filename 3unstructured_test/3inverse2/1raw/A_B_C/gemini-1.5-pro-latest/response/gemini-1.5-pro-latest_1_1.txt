**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. These traits, combined with the mention of "hard work and dedication" (often associated with these fields), make it highly probable Adam could be in this field. 
* **Business administration:** The personality sketch doesn't align well with typical stereotypes of business administration students. There's no mention of ambition for leadership, financial drive, or strong interpersonal skills, which are often associated with this field.
* **Computer science:** While the description mentions intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, the strong emphasis on nature and animals makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science. However, it's still possible as people in computer science have diverse interests.
