Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  The sketch heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" also fits the image of these professions. 
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch provides little to connect with business administration.  While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant, there's no mention of interests like finance, management, or economics.
* **Computer Science:**  This field is a bit trickier.  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and "understanding of abstract concepts" could point towards computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature makes it less likely than agricultural fields.
