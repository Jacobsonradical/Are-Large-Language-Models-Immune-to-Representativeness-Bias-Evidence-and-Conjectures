Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are subjective assessments based on stereotypes and the personality description:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things. This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture and veterinary medicine. 
* **Business Administration:**  The personality sketch lacks typical markers associated with business interests (e.g., leadership, ambition, risk-taking). While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, they're less specific indicators than the traits aligning with agriculture/veterinary science.
* **Computer Science:**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and mention of "abstract concepts" could point towards computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature makes it less likely than agriculture/veterinary science. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study.  Many individuals in each of these fields could potentially fit the description, and many others wouldn't fit the stereotype at all.
