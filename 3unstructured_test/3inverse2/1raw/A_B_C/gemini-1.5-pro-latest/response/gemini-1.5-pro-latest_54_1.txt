Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality description:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The description strongly aligns with this field.  A love of nature, plants, animals, and an appreciation for hard work are common traits for those pursuing careers in these areas. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** While the "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence could point towards computer science, the other traits (love of nature, empathy) are less typical drivers for this field.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** This personality profile has the weakest connection to business administration. The description lacks typical indicators for this field, such as an interest in leadership, management, or finance.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field can vary widely.
