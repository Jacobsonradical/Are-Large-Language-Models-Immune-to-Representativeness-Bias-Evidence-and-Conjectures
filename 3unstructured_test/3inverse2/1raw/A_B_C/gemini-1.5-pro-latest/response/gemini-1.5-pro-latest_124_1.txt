Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are subjective assessments based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to animals and agriculture. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** While not as strong a fit as agricultural sciences, the "quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles" and "high intelligence" aspects suggest a possible inclination towards computer science. Many in this field are drawn to the problem-solving and abstract thinking it requires.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The sketch provides little indication of traits typically associated with business administration, such as an interest in finance, marketing, or management. While empathy is valuable in business, the other traits make this field seem less likely. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study.  Many individuals in each field might match elements of this description, and Adam's true interests could lie elsewhere entirely.
