Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field.  Curiosity about nature, plant life, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in these areas.
* **Computer Science:** While intelligence and abstract thinking are associated with computer science, the other traits (love for nature, empathy) are less typical. It's possible, but less likely than agricultural sciences.
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely fit.  The personality sketch emphasizes empathy and a connection to the natural world, which aren't traditionally emphasized in business administration. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly subjective and based on general perceptions.  Individual personalities within any field can vary greatly.
