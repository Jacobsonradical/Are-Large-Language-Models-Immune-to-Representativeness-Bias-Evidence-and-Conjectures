  "computer science": "0.3"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field. The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in these areas. 
* **Business administration:**  The personality sketch doesn't mention typical business-oriented traits like ambition for leadership, financial drive, or strong networking skills. This makes it less likely.
* **Computer science:** While intelligence and abstract thinking are valuable in computer science, the description leans more towards a nature-loving and empathetic individual.  It's possible, but less likely than agricultural and veterinary sciences.
