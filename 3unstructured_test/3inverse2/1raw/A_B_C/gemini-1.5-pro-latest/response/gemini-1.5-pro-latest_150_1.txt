Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and is not statistically rigorous:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, animals, and potentially an appreciation for hard work (often associated with these fields) makes this the most likely. 
* **Business administration:** This is the least likely. The sketch lacks traits often associated with business aspirations like leadership, risk-taking, or a focus on financial success.
* **Computer science:**  While the description mentions intelligence and abstract thinking (relevant to computer science), the lack of direct interest in technology or problem-solving within a technological context makes it less likely than agricultural/veterinary science. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study.  Many individuals in each field could match this description, and many others within those fields wouldn't.
