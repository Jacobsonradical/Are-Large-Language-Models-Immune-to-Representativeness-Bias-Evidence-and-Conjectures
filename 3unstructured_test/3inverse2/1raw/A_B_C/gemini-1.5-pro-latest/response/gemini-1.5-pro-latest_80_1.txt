Here's an estimated probability breakdown, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The sketch strongly aligns with interests often found in these fields.  Love of nature, animals, and understanding hard work are strong indicators. 
* **Computer science:**  While intelligence and abstract thinking are common in computer science, the sketch lacks specific markers like interest in technology or programming. It's possible, but less likely based on the information.
* **Business administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the personality description.  Empathy and a love for nature are not typical drivers for choosing a business career path. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many individuals in any field can possess these personality traits.
