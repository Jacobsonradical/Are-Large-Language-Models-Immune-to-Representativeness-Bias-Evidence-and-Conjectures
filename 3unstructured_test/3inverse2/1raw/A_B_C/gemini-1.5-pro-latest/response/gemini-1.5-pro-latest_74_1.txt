Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** The sketch strongly emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and empathy â€“ all of which align well with this field. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects fit a computer science student, the sketch lacks a strong indication of interest in technology or programming. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** The personality description doesn't strongly suggest an interest in the core elements of business administration (finance, marketing, management). The "hard work and dedication" aspect is generally applicable but not unique to business. 

**Important Note:**  These are just estimations based on a limited personality sketch.  People are complex, and individuals in any field can possess a wide range of interests and personality traits.
