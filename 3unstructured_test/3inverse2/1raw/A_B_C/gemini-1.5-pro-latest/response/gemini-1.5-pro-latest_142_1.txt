Here's an estimated probability breakdown, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with someone in this field.  Love for nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in these areas.
* **Computer Science:**  While the "puzzle-solving" aspect fits, the sketch lacks a strong indication of interest in technology or abstract systems that are core to computer science.  It's possible, but less likely.
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely. The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for nature, and understanding hard work â€“ traits not typically associated as central to business administration. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a brief personality sketch. Many individuals in any field can possess these traits, and there's significant overlap between fields.
