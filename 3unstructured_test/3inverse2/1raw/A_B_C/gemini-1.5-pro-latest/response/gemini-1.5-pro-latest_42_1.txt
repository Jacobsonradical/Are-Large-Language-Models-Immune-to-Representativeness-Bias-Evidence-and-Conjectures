Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on personality inferences and not hard data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture or veterinary medicine.  
* **Computer science:** While the description mentions "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts" which could apply to computer science, there's no direct mention of technology or programming. It's a moderate probability.
* **Business administration:** This field is least likely. The personality sketch focuses on empathy, love for nature, and understanding hard work â€“ traits not as directly relevant to the core of business administration. 

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses based on stereotypes. Many individuals in computer science or business administration could share the described traits, and not everyone in agricultural fields will.
