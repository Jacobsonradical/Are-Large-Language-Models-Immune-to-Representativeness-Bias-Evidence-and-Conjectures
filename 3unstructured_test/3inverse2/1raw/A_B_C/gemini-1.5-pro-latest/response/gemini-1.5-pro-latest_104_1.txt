Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific understanding. This makes agricultural and veterinary science highly probable.
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" aspect hints at computer science, the lack of direct interest in technology makes it less likely than the field above.  However, intelligence and abstract thinking are common in this field.
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely. The sketch emphasizes empathy and understanding of hard work, which aren't stereotypical traits associated with business administration (though they can be present). 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information and common stereotypes.  Individual personalities within any field are highly diverse.
