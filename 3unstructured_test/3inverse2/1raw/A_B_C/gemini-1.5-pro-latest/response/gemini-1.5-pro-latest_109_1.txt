Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature ("genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants") and animals ("deep love for animals").  This makes a field related to agriculture or animal care highly probable. 

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The description of the subject enjoying puzzles and being good with abstract concepts aligns well with skills often found in computer science students. However, there's no direct mention of technology or programming, making it a moderate probability.

* **Business Administration (0.2):**  The personality sketch doesn't offer strong indicators aligning with typical business administration traits. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in any field, the emphasis on nature and empathy points away from a business focus, making it the least likely.
