Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  A love of nature, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work are all common traits in these professions.
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  While the sketch doesn't explicitly mention computers, the "enjoyment of puzzles" and "understanding abstract concepts" are common traits among those in computer science. The connection is less direct than with agricultural sciences.
* **Business Administration (0.2):** This field has the weakest connection to the personality sketch. While intelligence is valuable in business, the other traits (love of nature, empathy) are not as strongly associated with typical business administration roles. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  People's personalities and career choices are complex. Many individuals in each of these fields might not fit the stereotypical descriptions, and there could be other factors influencing Adam's actual field of study.
