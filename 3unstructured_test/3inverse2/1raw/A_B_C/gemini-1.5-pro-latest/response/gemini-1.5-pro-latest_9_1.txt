Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field.  Love of nature, animals, and understanding hard work are all common traits.
* **Computer Science:**  While the "puzzle-solving" aspect could point to computer science, the other traits are less typical (though not unheard of) in the field.
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely fit. The personality sketch emphasizes empathy and a connection to nature, which aren't central to traditional business administration roles. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid overgeneralizing.  Many individuals in computer science or business administration could have these traits. This assessment is based on probability, not certainty.
