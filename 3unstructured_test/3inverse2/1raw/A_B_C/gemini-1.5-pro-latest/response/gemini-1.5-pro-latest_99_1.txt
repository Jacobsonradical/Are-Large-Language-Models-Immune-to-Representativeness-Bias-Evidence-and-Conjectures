Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on personality stereotypes and the information provided is not definitive:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description aligns strongly with this field.  A love for nature, animals, and understanding hard work are common traits for those pursuing careers related to agriculture or animal care. 
* **Computer science:**  While intelligence and abstract thinking are valuable in computer science, the description lacks strong indicators typically associated with the field, like a passion for technology or programming. It's possible, but less likely.
* **Business administration:**  The personality sketch offers little to suggest an interest in business. Empathy and a love for nature don't typically align with the core focuses of business administration.  It's the least likely scenario.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. Many individuals in one field may share traits with those in another. This assessment is based on probabilities and general tendencies, not absolute truths.
