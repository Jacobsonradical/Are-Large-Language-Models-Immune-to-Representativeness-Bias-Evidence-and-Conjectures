Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature ("genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"), animals ("deep love for animals"), and potentially hands-on work ("understanding and appreciation for hard work").  This aligns very well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine.

* **Computer Science (0.4):** While the "enjoyment of solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" could point towards computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators of a passion for technology or programming, which are typical for this field. 

* **Business Administration (0.2):** The sketch provides little to connect with typical business administration interests. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the description focuses on more scientific and nature-oriented traits.
