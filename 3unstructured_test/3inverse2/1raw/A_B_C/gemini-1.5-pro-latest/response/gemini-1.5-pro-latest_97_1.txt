Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** The sketch heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This combined with empathy and appreciation for hard work strongly suggests a field related to agriculture or veterinary science. 

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and affinity for abstract concepts point towards an analytical mind often found in computer science students. However, the lack of direct mention of technology or computers makes it less likely than agricultural/veterinary science.

* **Business Administration (0.2):** While intelligence and understanding hard work are relevant to business, the other personality traits don't align as strongly.  The sketch lacks typical indicators of business interest like leadership, finance, or market dynamics.
