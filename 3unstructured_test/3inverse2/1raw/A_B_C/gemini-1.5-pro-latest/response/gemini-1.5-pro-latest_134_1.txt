Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the personality sketch is far from definitive:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:**  The description heavily emphasizes a love of nature, plants, and animals. This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture or veterinary medicine.  
* **Computer science:**  While intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are common in computer science, the sketch lacks the typical markers of a strong interest in technology, programming, or systems.  
* **Business administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy and understanding hard work, which are valuable in business, but it lacks the drive for leadership, ambition, and focus on financial success often associated with business students. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are based on broad generalizations. It's crucial to remember that people are diverse, and many individuals in each field defy stereotypes.
