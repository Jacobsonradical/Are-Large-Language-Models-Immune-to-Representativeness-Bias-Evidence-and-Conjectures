Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on personality stereotypes and the sketch provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, animals, understanding hard work (farming), and intelligence all point towards this being a high probability.
* **Computer Science:**  While the "puzzle-solving" aspect fits the stereotype of a computer science student, the other traits (love of nature, empathy) are less typical. It's plausible, hence a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration:** The sketch provides the weakest connection to this field.  While intelligence is valuable in business, the other traits aren't as strong of indicators compared to the other two fields. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just estimations based on limited information and stereotypes.  People's personalities and career choices are complex and can't be accurately predicted solely on a short description.
