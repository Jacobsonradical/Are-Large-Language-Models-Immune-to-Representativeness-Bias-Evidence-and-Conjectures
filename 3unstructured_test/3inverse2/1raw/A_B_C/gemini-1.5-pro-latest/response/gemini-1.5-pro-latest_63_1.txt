Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The description strongly aligns with someone in this field.  Love of nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care.

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  While the description doesn't explicitly mention computers, "enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are often associated with computer science aptitude.  It's plausible Adam could be drawn to the problem-solving aspects of this field.

* **Business Administration (0.1):** This personality sketch provides little indication of interest in business-related fields. The emphasis on nature, empathy, and abstract thinking makes it less likely.
