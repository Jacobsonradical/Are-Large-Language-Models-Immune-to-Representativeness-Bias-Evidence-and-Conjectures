**Explanation:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding plants. This strongly suggests a higher probability that Adam is in this field. 

* **Computer Science:** While the "enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" aspects fit the profile of someone in computer science, the other traits are not as strong of indicators.

* **Business Administration:**  The personality sketch lacks clear indicators of traits typically associated with business administration (e.g., leadership, strong communication, interest in finance). Thus, it has the lowest probability.
