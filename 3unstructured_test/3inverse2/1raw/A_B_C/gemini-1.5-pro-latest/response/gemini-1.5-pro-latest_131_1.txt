Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with the appreciation for hard work, makes a strong case for Adam being in this field.
* **Computer Science:**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with computer science. This field attracts individuals with a specific type of intelligence, making it moderately likely. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in business concepts or economics. This makes it the least likely field among the three.
