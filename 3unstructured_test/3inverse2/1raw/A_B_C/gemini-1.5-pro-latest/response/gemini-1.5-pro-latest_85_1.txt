Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on personality stereotypes and the information provided is not definitive:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing these fields.
* **Computer Science (0.6):**  The puzzle-solving aptitude and ability to grasp abstract concepts are common in computer science students. However, the description lacks specific indicators of a strong interest in technology or programming.
* **Business Administration (0.4):** This receives the lowest probability. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the description lacks typical indicators of someone drawn to business, such as leadership qualities, ambition for financial success, or interest in market dynamics.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of a person's field of study. Many other factors, like personal experiences, career goals, and specific interests, influence a person's academic choices.
