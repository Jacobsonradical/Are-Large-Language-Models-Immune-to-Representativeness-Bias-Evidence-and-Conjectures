Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the personality sketch is far from conclusive:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work are all common traits in these areas. 
* **Business Administration:** This field is less likely. While intelligence and puzzle-solving are useful in business, the sketch lacks indicators of ambition, leadership, or a drive for financial success often associated with business students.
* **Computer Science:** This field has a moderate probability.  Intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking are strong indicators of computer science aptitude. However, the sketch's emphasis on nature and empathy is less common in this field. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and generalizations.  Many individuals in each field defy these stereotypes.
