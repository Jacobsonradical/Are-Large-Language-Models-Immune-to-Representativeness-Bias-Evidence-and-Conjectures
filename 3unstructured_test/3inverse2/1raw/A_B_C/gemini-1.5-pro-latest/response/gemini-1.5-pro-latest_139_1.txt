Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the description could fit students in any of these fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description heavily emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work/dedication. This aligns strongly with common perceptions of people drawn to these fields. 
* **Computer science:** While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects fit the stereotype of computer science students, the other traits are less specific. It's possible, but the description doesn't lean as heavily in this direction.
* **Business administration:** This field is the least likely fit based on the description. The personality sketch lacks traits often associated with business, such as ambition, leadership, or financial acumen.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and stereotypes.  Many individuals in each field won't fit these descriptions.
