Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided is highly suggestive of one particular field:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, interest in plants, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care. 
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" aspect could point towards computer science, the other traits are less strong indicators. It's not uncommon for people in CS to have diverse interests, but the sketch emphasizes nature and empathy more prominently.
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the personality sketch.  While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are valuable in business, the other traits are not as directly relevant.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and potential biases. People's personalities and career choices are complex, and it's impossible to determine Adam's field of study with certainty based on this sketch alone.
