Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):** The sketch heavily implies an affinity for nature, plants, and animals. This makes a field like agricultural or veterinary science more likely than the others. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  Puzzle-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science.  
* **Business Administration (0.2):** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest an interest in the core aspects of business administration (finance, marketing, etc.). While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, they aren't unique to it.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative and based on limited information.  Personality sketches can be misleading, and people's interests and career choices are complex.
