Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The personality description strongly aligns with this field.  A love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in those pursuing these fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  While the description mentions intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, there's nothing directly suggesting a strong affinity for technology or programming.
* **Business Administration:** The description focuses on personal qualities rather than an inclination towards business, finance, or management. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many individuals in any field can share these personality traits.
