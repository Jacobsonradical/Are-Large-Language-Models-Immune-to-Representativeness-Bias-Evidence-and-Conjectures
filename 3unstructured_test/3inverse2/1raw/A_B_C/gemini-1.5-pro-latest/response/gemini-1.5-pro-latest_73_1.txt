Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field.  Love for nature, animals, understanding hard work all point towards this being a likely fit.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The sketch lacks typical traits associated with business aspirations like ambition, leadership, or a focus on financial success.  It's possible, but less probable.
* **Computer Science (0.3):** While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects hint at computer science, the strong emphasis on nature makes it less likely than agricultural sciences. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study. Many individuals in any field may share these traits, and people are far more complex than stereotypes.
