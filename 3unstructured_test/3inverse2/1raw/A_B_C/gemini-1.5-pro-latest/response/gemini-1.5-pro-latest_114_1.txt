Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  A love of nature, plants, animals, and an appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing these fields. This gets the highest probability.

* **Computer Science:**  While the "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence fit with computer science, the other traits are less specific.  It's plausible, but less likely than agricultural sciences based on the description.

* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the personality sketch. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the other traits aren't as strongly associated with this field.
