**Explanation:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The personality sketch strongly aligns with interests and traits often found in individuals pursuing agricultural and veterinary sciences.  The love for nature, animals, and understanding living systems make this a highly probable field for Adam. 
* **Business administration:** The sketch lacks typical indicators of interest in business, such as leadership, management, or finance. While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the other traits make it a less likely field for Adam.
* **Computer science:** While intelligence and problem-solving are central to computer science, the sketch's emphasis on nature and empathy suggests a lower probability. However, the ability to grasp abstract concepts keeps this field somewhat plausible, as there can be overlap with computational modeling of natural systems.
