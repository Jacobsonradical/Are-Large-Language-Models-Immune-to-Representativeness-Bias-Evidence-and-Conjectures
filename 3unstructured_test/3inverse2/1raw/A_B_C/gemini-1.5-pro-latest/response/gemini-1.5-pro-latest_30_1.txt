Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals.  Combined with empathy and a love for animals, this points heavily towards fields like agriculture or veterinary science.
* **Business administration:**  The sketch doesn't highlight traits typically associated with business administration like leadership, ambition for financial success, or strong interpersonal/persuasion skills. It's possible, but less likely.
* **Computer science:** While the sketch mentions intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, it lacks specific indicators like a passion for technology, problem-solving using algorithms, or building software.  

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches offer limited insight, and many individuals in one field possess traits common to others.
