**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific pursuits.  Here's why the probabilities are assigned as they are:

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** This field aligns very strongly with the description. A love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in these fields.  The probability is high, but not 1.0 because other fields can also foster these interests. 

* **Business administration:**  This field is less likely. The sketch doesn't mention interests usually associated with business like leadership, finance, or marketing. While someone in business can certainly have these personality traits, it's less probable.

* **Computer science:**  This field has a moderate probability. Intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding abstract concepts are common in computer science.  While the description lacks explicit links to technology, these underlying traits make it more likely than business administration.
