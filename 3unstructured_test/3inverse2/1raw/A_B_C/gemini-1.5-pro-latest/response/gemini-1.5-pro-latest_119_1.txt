Here's my assessment of the probabilities, based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:**  The description strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific understanding. This makes agricultural and veterinary science highly likely.
* **Business administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy and understanding hard work, which are valuable in business. However, the core interests (nature, puzzles, abstract concepts) don't align as strongly with a typical business administration student.
* **Computer science:** The puzzle-solving ability and affinity for abstract concepts are good indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
