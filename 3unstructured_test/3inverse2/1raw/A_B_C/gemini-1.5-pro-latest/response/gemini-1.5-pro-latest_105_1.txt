Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work are all common traits for individuals drawn to these areas. 
* **Computer Science:** While not as strong a match as agricultural sciences, the "puzzle-solving" aspect and "high intelligence/abstract concepts" fit well with a computer science student.  It's plausible, hence a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the sketch.  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the other traits are less specific or common motivators for this field compared to the other two. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember these are estimations based on limited information.  Many individuals with this personality might thrive in *any* of these fields, and there are always exceptions.
