Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly aligns with someone in this field.  A love for nature, animals, and an appreciation for hard work are common traits for vets and agricultural scientists.
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects fit the stereotype of a computer scientist, the other traits (love of nature, empathy) are less typical.  It's possible, but less likely than the other fields.
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  This field is the least likely match. The personality sketch lacks traits often associated with business, like ambition, leadership, or a focus on financial success.

**Important Note:**  These are rough estimates based on limited information and stereotypes. It's crucial to avoid making assumptions about individuals based solely on their field of study.
