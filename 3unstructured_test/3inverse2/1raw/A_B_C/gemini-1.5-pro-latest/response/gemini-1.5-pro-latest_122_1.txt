Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is quite open to interpretation:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch heavily emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work/dedication (often associated with farming/animal care). This makes it the most likely field *if* Adam's personality aligns strongly with his studies.

* **Computer Science (0.3):**  While not as direct a fit, "quiet, enjoys puzzles, high intelligence, abstract concepts" are common traits associated with computer science. It's plausible Adam finds beauty in the logic and problem-solving of this field.

* **Business Administration (0.1):** The sketch lacks typical business-oriented traits (ambition, leadership, risk-taking, financial focus). While someone empathetic could go into ethical business, it's the least likely fit based on the provided information.

**Important Notes:**

* These are rough estimates, NOT definitive. Personalities are diverse, and people don't always study fields that perfectly match them.
* The 2021 graduate student context provides minimal information to differentiate. 
* A single strong indicator (like Adam volunteering at an animal shelter) would drastically change these probabilities.
