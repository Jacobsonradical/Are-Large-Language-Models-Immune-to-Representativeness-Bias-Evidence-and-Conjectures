Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love for nature, curiosity about plants, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are all strong indicators. 
* **Computer Science:**  While the "puzzle-solving" aspect could suggest computer science, the other traits (love for nature, empathy for animals) are less common in this field.
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the personality description. The sketch doesn't highlight traits typically associated with business, like leadership, ambition, or risk-taking.

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on stereotypes.  People in any field can have diverse personalities, and it's impossible to definitively say what field Adam was in based on this sketch alone.
