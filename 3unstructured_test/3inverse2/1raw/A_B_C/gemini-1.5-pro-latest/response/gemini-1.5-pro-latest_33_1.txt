Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field. Love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in this area. This gets the highest probability. 

* **Computer Science:**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and high intelligence could suggest computer science. However, the sketch lacks direct links to technology or programming, making it less likely than agricultural sciences.

* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely. The personality description emphasizes empathy, love for nature, and understanding hard work â€“ traits not as central to traditional business administration roles.
