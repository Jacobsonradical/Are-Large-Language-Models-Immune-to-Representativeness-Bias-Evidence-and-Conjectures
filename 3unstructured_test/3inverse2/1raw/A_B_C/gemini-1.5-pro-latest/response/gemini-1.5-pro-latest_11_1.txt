Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based solely on the personality sketch and some very general stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch *strongly* aligns with this field.  The love of nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in these professions. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):** While not as strong a fit as Agricultural Science, the description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts points towards an analytical mind often found in computer science students.
* **Business Administration (0.2):** This has the lowest probability.  The sketch emphasizes empathy and a love for nature, traits not as commonly associated with business aspirations (though certainly not unheard of).

**Important Note:** These are just rough estimates based on limited information and stereotypes. An individual's personality is far more complex, and people in any field can possess a wide range of traits.
