Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, plants, and animals, combined with empathy and understanding hard work, makes this the most likely field for Adam.
* **Computer Science (0.3):** While the sketch mentions intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, common traits for computer science students, the other characteristics (love for nature, animals, empathy) are less typical. It's possible, but less probable than agricultural/veterinary science.
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  The sketch provides little to connect Adam to this field. Business administration often attracts individuals interested in management, finance, and economics. The described personality doesn't strongly suggest these interests, making it the least likely field.
