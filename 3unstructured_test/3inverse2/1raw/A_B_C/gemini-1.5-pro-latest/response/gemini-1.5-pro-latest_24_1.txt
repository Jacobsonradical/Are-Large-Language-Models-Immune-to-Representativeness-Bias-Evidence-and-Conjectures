Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, animals, and understanding hard work are common traits in these areas. 
* **Computer science:**  The puzzle-solving aspect and intelligence could point towards computer science. However, the lack of direct mention of technology or programming makes it less likely than agricultural/veterinary.
* **Business administration:**  This field is the least likely. The personality sketch emphasizes empathy and love for nature, which are not stereotypical traits associated with business administration.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are based on generalizations. Many individuals in computer science or business administration may possess the traits described. This exercise is about likelihood based on common perceptions, not a definitive judgment of any individual's field of study.
