Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding plants.  This makes Agricultural and Veterinary Science the most likely field for someone with these interests.
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The description of enjoying puzzles and being good at abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. It's certainly a possible field for this individual, hence a moderate probability. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The personality sketch lacks traits typically associated with business administration, such as a focus on leadership, management, or finance. While someone with these traits could theoretically be drawn to business, it seems less likely based on the information provided.
