Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is most suggestive of  agricultural and veterinary sciences:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.1",
  "business administration": "0.02",
  "computer science": "0.08"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (Lowest Probability):** The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field. The love for nature, animals, and understanding hard work are all common traits in these areas.  Since we're looking for the probability Adam ISN'T in this field, it's the lowest.
* **Business Administration (Highest Probability):**  The sketch lacks traits often associated with business, such as ambition for leadership, risk-taking, or strong interest in finance and markets.  It's the most likely he ISN'T in this field.
* **Computer Science (Mid-Range Probability):** While the "puzzle-solving" and abstract thinking aspects fit the profile of someone interested in computer science, the strong emphasis on nature and animals is less common. It falls somewhere in between. 

**Important Note:** These are very rough estimations based on limited information and stereotypes.  Many individuals in each field won't fit the mold.
