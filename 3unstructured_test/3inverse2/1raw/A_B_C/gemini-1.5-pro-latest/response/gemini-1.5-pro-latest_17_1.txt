Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes associated with the fields and the personality description:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in those pursuing these careers. 
* **Computer Science:**  While the "puzzle-solving" aspect hints at computer science, the description lacks strong indicators typically associated with the field like a passion for technology or coding. 
* **Business Administration:** The description least aligns with this field. The emphasis on nature, empathy, and lack of mentions of typical business interests (finance, economics, etc.) makes it less likely.

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field are highly diverse.
