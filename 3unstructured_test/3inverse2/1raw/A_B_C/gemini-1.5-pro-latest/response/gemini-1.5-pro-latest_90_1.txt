Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with empathy and appreciation for hard work, aligns well with fields like agriculture or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):** The "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence suggest an aptitude for computer science.  However, the sketch lacks a clear indication of interest in technology or computers, making it less likely than agricultural sciences.
* **Business Administration (0.2):**  The sketch doesn't strongly suggest an interest in business concepts, leadership, or finance, which are often associated with business administration. Therefore, it has the lowest probability.

**Important Note:**  These are just estimates based on a brief personality sketch.  Many other factors influence a person's choice of field, and individual variations are vast.
