Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality description:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.10",
  "computer science": "0.25"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.75):**  The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love of nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work are all common traits in those pursuing these fields. 
* **Business Administration (0.10):**  The personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest an interest in business. While intelligence and problem-solving are useful in business, the other traits point more towards scientific or nature-related fields.
* **Computer Science (0.25):** The puzzle-solving ability and affinity for abstract concepts could suggest an aptitude for computer science. However, the lack of specific mentions of technology or programming makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary sciences. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based solely on a brief personality sketch.  Many other factors influence a person's choice of field.
