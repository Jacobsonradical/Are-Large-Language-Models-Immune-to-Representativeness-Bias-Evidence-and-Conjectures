Here's an estimated probability breakdown, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  A love for nature, animals, and understanding hard work are all common traits in those pursuing these fields. 
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" aspect could point towards computer science, the other traits (love for nature, empathy) are less common drivers for this field. 
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the personality sketch.  The description doesn't highlight typical business-oriented traits like leadership, ambition, or risk-taking.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a brief sketch.  Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
