Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):**  The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine.  
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and mention of "abstract concepts" suggest an affinity for logical thinking often found in computer science students. However, the lack of direct references to technology makes this less likely than agricultural fields.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** This personality sketch provides little to no indication of interest in business, finance, or management, making it the least likely field for Adam. The "appreciation for hard work" could apply broadly, but it's not specific enough to suggest business administration. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This is purely speculative and based on general perceptions of these fields. Individual personalities within any field are incredibly diverse.
* The information about Adam being a graduate student in the US in 2021 provides minimal additional context.
