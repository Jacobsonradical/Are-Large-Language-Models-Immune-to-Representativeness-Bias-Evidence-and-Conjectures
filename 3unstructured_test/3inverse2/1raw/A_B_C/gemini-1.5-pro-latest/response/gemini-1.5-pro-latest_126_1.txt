Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work (often associated with agriculture). This makes it the most likely field *if* we know Adam isn't already studying it.
* **Computer science:**  While the sketch mentions intelligence, puzzles, and abstract concepts, which align with computer science, it lacks the strong indicators present for agriculture/veterinary. It's plausible, but less likely than the first option.
* **Business administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the sketch.  While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, they aren't as specific or strongly emphasized as the traits relevant to the other fields.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable for predicting someone's field of study. Many individuals with these traits could be in any of these fields, or something entirely different.
