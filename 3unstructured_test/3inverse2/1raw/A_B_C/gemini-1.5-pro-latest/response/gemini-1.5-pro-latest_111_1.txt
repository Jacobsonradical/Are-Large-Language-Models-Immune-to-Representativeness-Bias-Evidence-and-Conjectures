Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information given is not definitive:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work/dedication. These traits align strongly with someone interested in agriculture or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science:**  While intelligence and abstract thinking are common in computer science, the other traits are less specific. It's possible someone in this field enjoys puzzles and has the described empathy, but it's not a strong indicator.
* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch provides little indication of interest in business, finance, or management.  The traits mentioned (empathy, love for animals) are not traditionally associated with this field, making it the least likely. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are based on general perceptions. Individual personalities within any field can vary greatly.
