Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care. This gets the highest probability.

* **Computer Science:**  While not as strong a connection as agriculture, the puzzle-solving ability and aptitude for abstract concepts are common in computer science students. This gets a moderate probability.

* **Business Administration:** The sketch provides little direct correlation to business administration. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, they are not unique to the field. This gets the lowest probability.
