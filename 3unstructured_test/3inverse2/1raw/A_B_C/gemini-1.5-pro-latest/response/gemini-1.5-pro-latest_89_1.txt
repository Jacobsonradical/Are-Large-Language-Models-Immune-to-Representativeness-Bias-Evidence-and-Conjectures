Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals. The mention of "hard work and dedication" further aligns with the demands of these fields. This gets the highest probability.

* **Computer Science:**  While not a perfect match, the "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence suggest a possible fit with computer science. This field also attracts individuals interested in abstract concepts.

* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the sketch. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the other traits don't point strongly towards this field. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective interpretations of a personality sketch.  Actual enrollment numbers in these fields, as well as individual variations within fields, mean these probabilities are for illustrative purposes only.
