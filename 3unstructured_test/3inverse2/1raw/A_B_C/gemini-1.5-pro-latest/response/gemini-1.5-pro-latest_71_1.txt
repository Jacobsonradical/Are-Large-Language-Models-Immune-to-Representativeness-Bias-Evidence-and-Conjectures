Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (High Probability):** The description strongly aligns with this field.  A love for nature, plants, and animals, coupled with empathy, suggests a possible inclination towards these areas.

* **Business Administration (Low Probability):** The sketch lacks traits often associated with business administration, such as ambition for leadership, strong communication skills, or an interest in finance and markets. 

* **Computer Science (Moderate Probability):** While the description doesn't directly point to computer science, the "quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles" and his grasp of abstract concepts could indicate an aptitude for this field. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
