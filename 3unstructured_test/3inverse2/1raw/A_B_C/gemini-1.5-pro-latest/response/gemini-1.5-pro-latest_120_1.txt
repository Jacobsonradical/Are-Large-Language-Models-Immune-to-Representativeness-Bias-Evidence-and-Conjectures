Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, animals, understanding hard work all fit the profile of someone drawn to these areas. 
* **Computer Science:** While intelligence and puzzle-solving ability are associated with computer science, the description lacks strong indicators like a passion for technology or programming.  It's plausible, but less likely than agricultural sciences.
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely fit. The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for nature, and understanding hard work â€“ traits not typically associated as central to business administration. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember these are just probabilities based on limited information and stereotypes. Many individuals in each field defy these common perceptions.
