Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific understanding. This aligns well with agricultural and veterinary fields, making it the most likely. 
* **Computer Science:** The puzzle-solving aptitude and comfort with abstract concepts are common traits in computer science. While not as strong a fit as the agricultural field, it's still plausible.
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the personality. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, management, or marketing. 

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses based on limited information and common stereotypes. It's impossible to accurately determine someone's field of study solely from a personality sketch.
