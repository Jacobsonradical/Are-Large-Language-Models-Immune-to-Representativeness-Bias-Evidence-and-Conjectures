Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a brief personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The strong emphasis on nature, plants, animals, and potentially hard work (farming/veterinary care) makes this field the most likely fit for the description. 
* **Computer science:**  While not as strong a match as agricultural sciences, the "puzzle-solving" aspect and affinity for abstract concepts could point towards an interest in computer science. 
* **Business administration:** This field has the lowest probability. The description lacks typical indicators associated with business interests like leadership, ambition for financial success, or strong interpersonal/negotiation skills.  

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches offer very limited information.  A person's actual field of study is influenced by a complex interplay of factors beyond personality, such as opportunities, family background, and specific interests.
