Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with the appreciation for hard work (often associated with these fields), makes it highly probable.
* **Computer Science:**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence align with computer science. However, the lack of direct references to technology or programming makes it less probable than agricultural science. 
* **Business Administration:** This field has the lowest probability. The sketch emphasizes empathy and a love for living things, traits not as central to typical business administration stereotypes. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a brief sketch.  Individual personalities within any field are highly diverse.
