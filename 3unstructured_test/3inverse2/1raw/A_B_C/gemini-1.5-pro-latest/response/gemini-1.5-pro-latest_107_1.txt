Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided is highly suggestive of one field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.10",
  "computer science": "0.25"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work are all common traits in those pursuing these careers. 
* **Business Administration:** This profile doesn't fit the common stereotype of a business student. While intelligence and puzzle-solving are useful in business, the emphasis on nature and empathy points away from this field.
* **Computer Science:** While the "quiet, puzzle-solving" aspect aligns somewhat with computer science stereotypes, the strong emphasis on nature and animals makes this field less likely. However, it's more probable than business administration given the analytical skills mentioned. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes.  People's personalities and career choices are far more complex.
