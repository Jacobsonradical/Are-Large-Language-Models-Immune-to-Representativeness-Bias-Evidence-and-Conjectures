Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, plants, animals, and understanding of hard work are all common traits in those pursuing these fields.
* **Computer Science:** While intelligence and abstract thinking are important in computer science, the other traits are less specific.  It's plausible, but less likely than agricultural sciences based on the description.
* **Business administration:** This field is the least likely fit. The sketch emphasizes empathy and a love for nature, which are not traits typically associated with a strong inclination towards business administration. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on stereotypes.  People's personalities and career choices are complex! There are certainly individuals who defy these probabilities.
