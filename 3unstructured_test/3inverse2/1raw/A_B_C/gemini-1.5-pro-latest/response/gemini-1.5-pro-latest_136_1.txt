Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals. The emphasis on empathy and a "warm heart" further points towards a field focused on living things. This makes agricultural and veterinary science the most likely field *if* Adam is not in that field already.
* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence and an ability to grasp abstract concepts, common traits for computer science students,  the lack of any direct connection to technology or problem-solving in a computational context makes it less likely than agricultural/veterinary science.
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely given the description. The sketch lacks any mention of business acumen, leadership, or interest in financial matters, which are typical characteristics of those drawn to business administration.
