Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field. Love for nature, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work are common traits for vets and agricultural scientists. 
* **Computer science:**  While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects fit the stereotype of a computer scientist, the rest of the description leans more towards a nature-oriented personality.  
* **Business administration:**  This field is the least likely fit. The personality sketch lacks typical markers associated with business aspirations like ambition, leadership, or a focus on financial success. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes.  People's personalities and career choices are complex and can't be accurately predicted from a short description.
