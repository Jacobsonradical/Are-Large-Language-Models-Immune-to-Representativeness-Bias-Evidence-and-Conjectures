Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on personality stereotypes and the information provided is not definitive:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch heavily emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work/dedication (often associated with farming/animal care). This makes it the most likely field *if* Adam isn't in this field already.
* **Computer Science:**  Intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking are strong links to computer science. This makes it moderately likely.
* **Business Administration:** The sketch provides little connection to typical business-oriented traits (leadership, risk-taking, financial acumen).  While someone with these traits could go into business, it's less likely based on the information.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are very limited. Many individuals in ANY field can possess these traits, so these probabilities are just educated guesses.
