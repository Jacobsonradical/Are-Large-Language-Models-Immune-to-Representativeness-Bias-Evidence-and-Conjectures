Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work/dedication.  These are strong indicators of someone potentially in this field, hence the high probability.
* **Computer Science:**  While "solving puzzles" and "understanding abstract concepts" are linked to computer science, the overall profile leans more towards a love for the natural world. It's possible, but less likely than agricultural fields.
* **Business Administration:** This profile has the fewest direct links to business.  Empathy and a warm heart are valuable in business, but not as defining as other traits mentioned. Therefore, it has the lowest probability. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember these are just educated guesses based on limited information and common stereotypes. People's personalities and career choices are complex and diverse!
