Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and an appreciation for hard work. These strongly align with someone interested in agriculture or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science:** While intelligence and puzzle-solving are associated with computer science, the other traits (love for nature, empathy) are less common stereotypes. It's possible, but less likely based on the sketch alone.
* **Business Administration:**  The personality sketch offers little to suggest an inclination towards business.  Empathy and a warm heart can be found in business, but the other traits aren't strong indicators.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise.  Personality sketches can be misleading, and people in any field can possess diverse traits.
