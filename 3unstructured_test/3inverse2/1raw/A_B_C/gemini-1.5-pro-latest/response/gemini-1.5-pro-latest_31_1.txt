Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care.

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  While the description mentions intelligence and abstract thinking (traits common in computer science), it lacks specific indicators like a love for technology or programming. It's possible, but less likely than agricultural science based on the information.

* **Business Administration (0.2):** This field has the weakest connection to the sketch. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the description lacks indicators like an interest in finance, leadership, or market dynamics.
