Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, plants, and animals. The mention of empathy and a love for animals aligns well with veterinary science.  This field gets the highest probability. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts fits well with computer science. This is a common trait among those in the field, making it a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration:**  The personality sketch doesn't offer strong indicators aligning with business administration. While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, the other traits point more strongly towards fields focused on nature or analytical problem-solving. This receives the lowest probability.
