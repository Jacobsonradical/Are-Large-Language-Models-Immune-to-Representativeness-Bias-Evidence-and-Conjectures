Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals. This aligns perfectly with fields like agriculture or veterinary medicine, making it the most probable field for Adam. 
* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy and understanding of hard work, which are relevant to business. However, the core interests (nature, puzzles, abstract concepts) are less typical for someone drawn to business administration. It's possible, but less likely.
* **Computer Science:** The puzzle-solving ability and affinity for abstract concepts hint at a potential interest in computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals makes this field less likely than agricultural/veterinary sciences but more probable than business administration.
