Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch heavily implies an affinity for nature, plants, and animals. This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine.  
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" aspect could hint at computer science, there's nothing else in the sketch that particularly suggests this field. Intelligent individuals exist in all fields.
* **Business Administration:** This field is least likely given the sketch. The description emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work â€“ traits not typically associated as strongly with business administration compared to the other fields.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember these are just probabilities based on limited information and stereotypical associations. Many individuals with these personality traits thrive in fields outside of these stereotypes.
