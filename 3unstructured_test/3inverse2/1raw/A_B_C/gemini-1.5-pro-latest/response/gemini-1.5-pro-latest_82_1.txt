Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on general stereotypes:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description heavily leans towards this field.  A love for nature, plants, and animals, coupled with empathy, aligns strongly with these professions.
* **Computer science:** While high intelligence and puzzle-solving ability are common traits in computer science, the other characteristics (love for nature, empathy) are less typical. It's possible, but less likely than agricultural sciences.
* **Business administration:** This field has the lowest probability. The personality sketch lacks traits often associated with business, such as ambition for leadership, strong communication skills, or a focus on financial success.  

**Important Note:**  These are very rough estimations. People's personalities and career choices are complex. There are undoubtedly individuals in each of these fields who fit the description, and many who don't.
