Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The personality description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, plants, animals, and an appreciation for hard work (common in agricultural practices) all point towards a higher probability. 

* **Computer Science:**  While the description mentions intelligence and abstract thinking (relevant to computer science), it lacks the typical markers often associated with the field (e.g., a passion for technology, programming, etc.).  It's possible, but less likely than agricultural sciences.

* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the description. While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, the core aspects of the sketch don't strongly suggest an inclination towards business administration.
