**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, animals, and problem-solving. 

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** aligns most with these traits: a love for animals, curiosity about plants, and an appreciation for hard work are common in these fields. Thus, the probability is relatively high.
* **Computer science** often attracts individuals with strong problem-solving skills and an affinity for abstract concepts, which the sketch mentions. However, the emphasis on nature makes it less likely than agricultural sciences.
* **Business administration** has the weakest connection. While intelligence and dedication are valuable in business, the sketch lacks indicators of a strong interest in economics, management, or finance. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches offer limited insight into a person's actual field of study. Many other factors influence career choices.
