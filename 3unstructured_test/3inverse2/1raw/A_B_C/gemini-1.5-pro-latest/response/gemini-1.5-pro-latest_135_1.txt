Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (High Probability):** The sketch strongly aligns with interests often found in these fields: love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work. 
* **Business Administration (Low Probability):**  The description lacks typical markers associated with business interests (e.g., leadership, ambition for financial success, strong communication skills). 
* **Computer Science (Moderate Probability):** While not as strong a fit as agricultural sciences, the emphasis on intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving aligns somewhat with computer science stereotypes. 

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on limited information.  People's personalities and career choices are complex. There are plenty of individuals who defy these stereotypes.
