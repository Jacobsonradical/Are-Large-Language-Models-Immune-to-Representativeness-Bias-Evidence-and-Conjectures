Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):**  The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):** While not as strong a fit as the previous, the description mentions "enjoying solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts," which are relevant to computer science. It's plausible Adam could be in this field.
* **Business Administration (0.2):** This field has the weakest connection to the description. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, management, or marketing.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on limited information.  A more complete picture of Adam's interests and skills would be needed for a more accurate assessment.
