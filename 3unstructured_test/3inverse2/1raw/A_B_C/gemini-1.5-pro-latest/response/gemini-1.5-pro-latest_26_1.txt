} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** has the highest probability because the description directly mentions a "genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" and "a deep love for animals."  
* **Computer science** is given a moderate probability.  While not directly related to nature, enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are aligned with someone in this field.  
* **Business administration** has the lowest probability. The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, understanding hard work, and a love for nature and animals, traits not as strongly associated with the core focus of a business administration program.
