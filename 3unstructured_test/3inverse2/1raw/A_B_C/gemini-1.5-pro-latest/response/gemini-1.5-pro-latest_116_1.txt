Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are just informed guesses based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals.  Combined with intelligence and an appreciation for hard work, this field seems highly probable.
* **Computer science:**  While the "puzzle-solving" aspect aligns somewhat with computer science, the sketch lacks typical indicators of a strong interest in technology, programming, or engineering. It's possible, but less likely than agriculture.
* **Business administration:** This field is least aligned with the personality description. The sketch emphasizes empathy and a love for living things, which aren't strong indicators of a business inclination. 

**Important Note:** Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. People are diverse, and their interests can't be easily pigeonholed.
