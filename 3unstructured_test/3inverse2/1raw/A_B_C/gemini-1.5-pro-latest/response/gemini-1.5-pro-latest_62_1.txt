Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, animals, and understanding hard work are common traits for vets and agricultural scientists. This gets the highest probability.

* **Computer Science:**  The sketch mentions puzzle-solving and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science.  This field attracts a range of personalities, so it's plausible but not as strong a match as agricultural sciences.

* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the sketch. While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, the description doesn't strongly suggest an interest in business itself.
