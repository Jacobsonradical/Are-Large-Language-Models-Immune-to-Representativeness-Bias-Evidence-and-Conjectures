Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love of nature, plants, and animals, combined with intelligence and an appreciation for hard work, makes this a very likely fit. 
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" aspect could point towards computer science, the other traits (love for nature, empathy, warmth) are less typical of the stereotype of this field. It's plausible, but less likely than agricultural/veterinary science.
* **Business Administration:** The sketch provides very little to connect Adam to this field. The focus on empathy, nature, and abstract thinking doesn't strongly suggest an interest in business. This makes it the least likely of the three options.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a brief personality sketch and some very general stereotypes.  Individual personalities within each field vary greatly.
