Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" further aligns with the realities of these fields. This gets the highest probability.

* **Computer Science:** While not directly indicated in the sketch, high intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding abstract concepts are common traits among those in computer science.  Therefore, it's plausible but less likely than agricultural sciences.

* **Business Administration:**  The sketch doesn't offer strong indicators for a business inclination. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the other traits point more strongly towards fields related to nature or analytical problem-solving. This gets the lowest probability.
