Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific understanding (curiosity about plants, abstract thinking). This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" the most likely field *if* Adam wasn't studying it, meaning many others in this field would likely share these traits.
* **Computer Science:**  While not as strong a connection, intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding abstract concepts are often associated with computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the description. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch doesn't highlight traits typically associated with this field.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on general stereotypes.  Individual personalities within any field are diverse.
