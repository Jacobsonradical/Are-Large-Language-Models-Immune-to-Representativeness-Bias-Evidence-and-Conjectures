Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is subjective and based on stereotypes associated with each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love of nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing these careers. 
* **Computer Science:**  While intelligence and problem-solving are associated with computer science, the other traits (love of nature, empathy) are less stereotypical. It's plausible, hence a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration:** This field is least aligned with the personality sketch.  The focus on empathy and nature doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. It's possible, but less likely.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information. People's personalities and career choices are complex, and it's impossible to determine Adam's field with certainty.
