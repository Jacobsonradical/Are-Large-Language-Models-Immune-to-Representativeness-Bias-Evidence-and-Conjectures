Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding plants. This aligns strongly with someone interested in agricultural and veterinary science, making it the most likely field *excluding* Adam's actual field.

* **Computer Science:**  While not as direct a match as agricultural science, the emphasis on puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence fits well with the profile of someone interested in computer science. 

* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the description. While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business, the other traits are less specific. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just probabilities based on limited information.  People's personalities and interests are complex, and there are always exceptions. 
* The fact that Adam is a graduate student in the US in 2021 adds some context but doesn't drastically change the likelihoods based on the personality traits alone.
