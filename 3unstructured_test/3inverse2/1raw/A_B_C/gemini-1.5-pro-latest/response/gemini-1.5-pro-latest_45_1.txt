Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love for nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in those pursuing these careers. Thus, the probability is high.
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" aspect could point towards computer science, the other traits (love for nature, empathy) are less typical. It's not impossible, hence a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the personality description. While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are valuable in business, the other traits are less defining. Therefore, the probability is the lowest. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimations based on limited information and common stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field can vary greatly.
