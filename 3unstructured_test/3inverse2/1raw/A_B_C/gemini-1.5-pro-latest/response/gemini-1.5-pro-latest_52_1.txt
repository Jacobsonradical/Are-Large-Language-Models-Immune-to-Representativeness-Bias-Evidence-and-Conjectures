Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** The sketch heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This strongly suggests a field related to agriculture or veterinary science. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The description mentions "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts," which are often associated with computer science. However, the lack of specific technological interest makes this less likely than agricultural/veterinary science.
* **Business Administration (0.2):** There's little in the sketch to directly suggest an interest in business administration. While "understanding hard work and dedication" could apply, it's not specific enough to warrant a high probability. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember these are just probabilities based on limited information.  People's personalities and interests are diverse, and assuming someone's field of study based on a brief description can be misleading.
