Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes associated with each field and not hard data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The emphasis on nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work is highly suggestive of someone interested in agriculture or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** The "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence hint at computer science, but the lack of specific mentions of technology or programming makes it less likely than agricultural/veterinary science.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** This field has the weakest connection to the description. While intelligence and understanding hard work are relevant, the other traits don't strongly suggest an interest in business. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these probabilities are based on generalizations.  People's personalities and interests are diverse, and there are individuals passionate about computer science who love nature, or business administration students deeply empathetic towards animals.
