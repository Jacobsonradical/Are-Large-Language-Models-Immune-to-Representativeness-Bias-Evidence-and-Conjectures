Here's an estimated probability breakdown, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals, combined with intelligence and appreciation for hard work. This strongly suggests a higher probability of Adam being in this field.
* **Computer science:** While not as strong a match as agricultural sciences, the "quiet, puzzle-solving" aspect aligns well with common perceptions of computer science students. The mention of understanding abstract concepts further supports this possibility.
* **Business administration:**  The sketch lacks clear indicators aligning with typical business administration traits (e.g., leadership, risk-taking, financial acumen).  Therefore, it receives the lowest probability.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative and based on limited information and stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration might possess the described traits, and conversely, not every student in agricultural sciences perfectly fits the profile.
