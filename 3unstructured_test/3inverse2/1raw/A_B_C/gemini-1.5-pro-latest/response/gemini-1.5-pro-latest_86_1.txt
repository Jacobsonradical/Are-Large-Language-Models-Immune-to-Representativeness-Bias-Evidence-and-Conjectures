Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, plants, and animals, plus an understanding of hard work and dedication, are common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care. 

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  A quiet, puzzle-solving nature with high intelligence fits the stereotype of someone interested in computer science. However, the sketch lacks direct indicators like an interest in technology or programming.

* **Business Administration (0.3):**  This field has the weakest connection to the provided description. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes traits more aligned with scientific or nature-oriented fields. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on general stereotypes and the information provided. It's impossible to definitively determine Adam's field of study solely from a personality sketch.
