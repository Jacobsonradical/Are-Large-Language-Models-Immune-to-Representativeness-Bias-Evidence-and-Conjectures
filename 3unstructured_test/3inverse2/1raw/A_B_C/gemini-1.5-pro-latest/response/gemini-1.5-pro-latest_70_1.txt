Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in those pursuing these careers. This gets the highest probability. 
* **Computer Science:**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and high intelligence fit the stereotype of this field. However, the other traits (love of nature, empathy) are less typical, though not unheard of. 
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely fit. The personality sketch lacks traits often associated with business aspirations, such as ambition, leadership, or a focus on financial success. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and stereotypes. People are diverse, and someone's personality doesn't dictate their field of study.
