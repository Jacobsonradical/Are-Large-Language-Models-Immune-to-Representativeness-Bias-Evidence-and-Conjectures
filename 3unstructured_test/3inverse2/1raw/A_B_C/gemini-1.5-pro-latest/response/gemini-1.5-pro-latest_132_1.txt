Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is quite open to interpretation:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.5"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The description heavily implies someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work. This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture or veterinary medicine.

* **Computer Science (0.5):**  The "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects fit the profile of someone interested in computer science. However, the other traits are less specific to this field.

* **Business Administration (0.3):** This is given the lowest probability because nothing in the description directly suggests an interest in business, finance, or management. While someone with these traits *could* go into business, it's less likely based on the information provided.
