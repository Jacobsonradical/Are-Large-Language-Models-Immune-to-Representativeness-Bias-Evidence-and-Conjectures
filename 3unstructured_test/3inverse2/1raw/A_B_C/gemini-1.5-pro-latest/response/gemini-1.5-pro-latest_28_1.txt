Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The personality description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits for vets and agricultural scientists. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  The sketch lacks typical indicators of someone drawn to business, such as ambition for leadership, focus on financial success, or strong interpersonal/persuasion skills. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** While the puzzle-solving ability and intelligence could suggest an aptitude for computer science, the strong connection to nature and animals makes it seem less likely than agricultural sciences.  

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and stereotypes. People are diverse, and someone can easily defy these expectations.
