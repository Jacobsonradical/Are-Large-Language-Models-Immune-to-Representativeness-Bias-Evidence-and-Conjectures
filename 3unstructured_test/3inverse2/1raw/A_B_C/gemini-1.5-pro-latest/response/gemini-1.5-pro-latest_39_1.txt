Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field:
    * "Curiosity about nature and plants" 
    * "Love for animals"
    * "Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication" (often associated with these fields). 
* **Computer Science:** While not as strong a match as agricultural sciences, the following traits are somewhat common in computer science students:
    * "Enjoys solving puzzles"
    * "High intelligence"
    * "Good at understanding abstract concepts"
* **Business Administration:**  This field has the weakest connection to the personality sketch. The traits mentioned don't strongly suggest an interest in business. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember these are just probabilities based on general tendencies.  People's personalities and interests are complex, and there are certainly individuals who defy these stereotypes.
