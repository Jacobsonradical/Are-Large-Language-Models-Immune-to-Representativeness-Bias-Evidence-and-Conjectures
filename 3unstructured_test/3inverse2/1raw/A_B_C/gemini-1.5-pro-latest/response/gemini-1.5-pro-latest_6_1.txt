Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a very brief personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work/dedication. These traits align very well with fields like agriculture or veterinary medicine.
* **Computer science:** While intelligence and abstract thinking are common in computer science, the other traits are less specific. It's possible, but the sketch doesn't strongly suggest it.
* **Business administration:**  This field is the least likely. The sketch lacks any mention of business acumen, leadership, or interest in markets/finance â€“ typical characteristics of those drawn to business administration.
