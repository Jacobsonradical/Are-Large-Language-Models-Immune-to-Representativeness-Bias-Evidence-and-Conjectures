Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The emphasis on nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work all point towards a higher probability of Adam being in this field.
* **Computer Science:**  While not as strong a match as Agricultural Science, the puzzle-solving ability and aptitude for abstract concepts could suggest an interest in computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the personality description. There's little to suggest a strong interest in business concepts. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch. Many other factors influence a person's choice of field.
