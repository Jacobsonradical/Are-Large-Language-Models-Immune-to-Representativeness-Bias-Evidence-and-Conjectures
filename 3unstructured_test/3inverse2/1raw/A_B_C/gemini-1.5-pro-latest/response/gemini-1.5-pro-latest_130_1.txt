Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on personality stereotypes and the information provided is very limited:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily leans towards this field.  Love of nature, animals, understanding hard work (farming) all point towards a higher probability. 
* **Computer Science:**  While the description mentions "solving puzzles" and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, it lacks the strong indicators we see for agricultural sciences. 
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely based on the description. There's no mention of interest in finance, management, or economics, which are typical for business students. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are very limited in predicting someone's field of study.  Plenty of people in *any* field could fit the description, and these probabilities are just estimates based on general stereotypes.
