Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" also fits the image of these professions.

* **Business Administration:**  The sketch lacks traits typically associated with business aspirations, such as leadership, ambition, risk-taking, or a focus on finance.  While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, they aren't specific enough to suggest this field.

* **Computer Science:** The puzzle-solving ability and aptitude for abstract concepts could point towards computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals makes this field less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary sciences.
