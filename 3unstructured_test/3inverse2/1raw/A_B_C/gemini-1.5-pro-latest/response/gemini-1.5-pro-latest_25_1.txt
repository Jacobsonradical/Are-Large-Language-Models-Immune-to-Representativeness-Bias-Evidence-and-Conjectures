**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, empathy (animals), and potentially problem-solving (puzzles). 

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** aligns very well with these traits, hence the high probability.
* **Computer science**, while potentially a good fit for someone who enjoys puzzles and abstract concepts, doesn't align as strongly with the nature and animal-loving aspects. 
* **Business administration** has the weakest connection to the described personality, leading to the lowest probability.
