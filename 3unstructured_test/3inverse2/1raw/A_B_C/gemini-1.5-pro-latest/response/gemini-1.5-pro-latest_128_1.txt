Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work. This aligns well with the fields of agriculture and veterinary science, making it the most probable.
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and abstract thinking – traits often associated with computer science – the lack of direct links to technology makes it less likely than agricultural/veterinary science.
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch emphasizes empathy and understanding hard work, which are valuable in business. However, the focus on nature and animals makes this field the least likely fit.

**Important Note:** This is purely speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic or career choices.  Many individuals with these traits excel in various fields.
