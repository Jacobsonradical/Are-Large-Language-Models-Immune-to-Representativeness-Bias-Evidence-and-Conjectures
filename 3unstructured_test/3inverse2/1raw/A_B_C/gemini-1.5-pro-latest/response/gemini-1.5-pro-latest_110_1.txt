Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are subjective assessments based on the personality description:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The strong emphasis on nature, plants, animals, and potentially hard work (farming/veterinary care) makes this field highly probable given the description. 
* **Computer Science:**  While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects fit the stereotype of computer science, the description lacks a strong indicator of typical computer science interests (technology, programming, etc.). 
* **Business Administration:** This field has the lowest probability. The personality sketch doesn't highlight traits often associated with business, such as leadership, ambition for financial success, or strong interpersonal skills. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. Many individuals in ANY field could align with some of the described traits.
