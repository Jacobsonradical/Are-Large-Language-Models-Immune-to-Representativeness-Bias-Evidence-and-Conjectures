Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on personality stereotypes and the information provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This strongly suggests a higher probability Adam is in a field related to these interests.
* **Computer science:** While the description mentions "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts" which could align with computer science, there's no direct mention of technology or programming. It's plausible, but less likely than agricultural sciences based on the information.
* **Business administration:**  The personality sketch lacks traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, ambition for financial success, or strong interpersonal/persuasion skills. This makes it the least likely field for Adam based on the provided information. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and stereotypical associations.  People are diverse, and a personality sketch cannot definitively determine someone's field of study.
