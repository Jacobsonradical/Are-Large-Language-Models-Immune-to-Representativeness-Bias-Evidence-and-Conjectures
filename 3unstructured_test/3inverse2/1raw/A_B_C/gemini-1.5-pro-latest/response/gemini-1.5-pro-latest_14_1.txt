Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in this area. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  While not as strong a match as agricultural sciences, the  "enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" aspects fit well with a computer science student.  Many people in this field also have an appreciation for nature.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** This personality sketch has the fewest direct links to business administration. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the other traits are less specific or common in this field compared to the other two. 

**Important Note:** This is a subjective assessment based on stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field can vary widely.
