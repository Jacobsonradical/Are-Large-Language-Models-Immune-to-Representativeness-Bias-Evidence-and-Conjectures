Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, animals, understanding hard work all point towards a higher probability.
* **Business Administration (0.2):**  The sketch doesn't strongly suggest an interest in business. While intelligence and problem-solving are useful in business, the other traits are less typical.
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The description mentions enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are common traits in computer science students. However, the lack of explicit interest in technology makes it less likely than agricultural sciences. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that personality sketches are not definitive predictors of someone's field of study. People are diverse, and these probabilities are based on general tendencies, not absolute rules.
