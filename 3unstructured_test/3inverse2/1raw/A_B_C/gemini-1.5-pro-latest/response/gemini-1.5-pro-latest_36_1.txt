Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are subjective assessments based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description aligns strongly with this field.  The love for nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in these areas. 
* **Computer Science:** While intelligence and abstract thinking are valuable in computer science, the personality sketch lacks typical markers like a passion for technology or problem-solving with systems. It's possible, but less likely.
* **Business Administration:**  This field is the least likely. The sketch emphasizes empathy and a connection to the natural world, which aren't as central to typical business administration personalities.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  People's personalities and career choices are complex. There are many compassionate computer scientists and nature-loving business professionals!
