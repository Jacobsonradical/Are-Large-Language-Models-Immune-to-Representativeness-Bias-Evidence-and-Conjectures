Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on personality stereotypes and the information given:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love of nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care. 
* **Computer Science:**  While the "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence fit the stereotype of a computer science student, the other traits (love of nature, empathy) are less typical. It's plausible, but less likely than agricultural science.
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely based on the description.  The sketch lacks typical business-oriented traits (ambition, leadership, focus on financial success). 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of a person's field of study. Many individuals in each of these fields may possess the described traits, and many others within those fields will have very different personalities.
