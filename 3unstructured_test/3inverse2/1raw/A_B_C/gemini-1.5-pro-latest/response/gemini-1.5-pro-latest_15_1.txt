Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and is highly subjective:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine.  
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and mention of "abstract concepts" suggest an aptitude for logic and problem-solving often found in computer science students.  
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The sketch lacks typical indicators of someone drawn to business, like leadership, risk-taking, or financial interest.  The emphasis on empathy and love for nature doesn't typically align with common perceptions of this field.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are very limited. Many individuals in any field possess these traits, and there are many other factors influencing a person's career choice.
