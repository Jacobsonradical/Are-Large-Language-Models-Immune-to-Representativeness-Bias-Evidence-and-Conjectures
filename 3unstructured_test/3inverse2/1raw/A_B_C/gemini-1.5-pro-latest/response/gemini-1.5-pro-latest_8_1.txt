Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine, making it the most likely area of study for someone with these traits.
* **Computer science:**  While not as strong a match as the first, the mention of "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts" could suggest an affinity for logic and problem-solving often found in computer science students. 
* **Business administration:** This field is least aligned with the personality sketch. There's little mention of interests typically associated with business like leadership, finance, or marketing. The emphasis on empathy and love for nature doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on limited information.  Personality sketches can offer hints about a person's interests, but they are not definitive predictors of career choices.
