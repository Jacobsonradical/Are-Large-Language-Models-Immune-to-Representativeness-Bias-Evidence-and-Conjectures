Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, plants, and animals, combined with appreciation for hard work, makes this a highly probable match.
* **Computer Science:** While intelligence and abstract thinking are common traits in computer science, the other descriptors (love of nature, empathy) are less central to the field. It's still possible, hence a moderate probability. 
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the personality sketch. While intelligence is valuable in business, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals doesn't typically align with the core values of this field. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on common stereotypes.  Individual personalities within each field vary greatly.
