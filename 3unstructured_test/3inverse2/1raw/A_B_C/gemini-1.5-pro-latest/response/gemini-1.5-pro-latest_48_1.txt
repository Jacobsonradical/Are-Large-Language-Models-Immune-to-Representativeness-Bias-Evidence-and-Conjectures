Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, animals, understanding of hard work (farming), and even puzzle-solving (problem-solving in animal care/agriculture) make this a highly likely fit.

* **Business Administration (0.1):**  While intelligence and abstract thinking are useful in business, the personality description lacks strong indicators of interest in finance, management, or marketing, which are core elements of business administration.

* **Computer Science (0.3):**  The puzzle-solving ability and affinity for abstract concepts are common traits in computer science students. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals in the description makes this field less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
