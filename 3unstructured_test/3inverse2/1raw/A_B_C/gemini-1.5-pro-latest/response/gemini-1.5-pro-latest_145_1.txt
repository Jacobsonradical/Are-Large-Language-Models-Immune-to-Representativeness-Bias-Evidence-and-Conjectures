Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the personality sketch, not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with someone interested in this field.  Love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in these fields.
* **Computer Science:**  While the "puzzle-solving" aspect hints at computer science, the other traits (empathy, love for animals, nature) are less typical. It's not impossible, hence a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest alignment. The personality sketch lacks typical business-oriented traits like ambition, leadership, or risk-taking. It's the least likely field based on the description.
