Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in those pursuing careers related to animals and agriculture. This gets the highest probability.
* **Computer Science:**  The description of the subject enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with skills often found in computer science students. However, the lack of direct mention of technology or computers makes it slightly less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the other traits described don't strongly suggest a business inclination. This field gets the lowest probability. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember these are just educated guesses based on limited information.  People are diverse, and there are individuals passionate about business who fit the personality sketch, just as there are computer scientists who adore nature.
