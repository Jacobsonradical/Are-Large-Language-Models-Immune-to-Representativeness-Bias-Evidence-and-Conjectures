Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the description could fit students in any of these fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  This makes it the most likely field for someone with these interests.
* **Computer Science:**  The "quiet, puzzle-solving" aspect aligns with common perceptions of computer science students. The mention of abstract concepts also fits. However, the lack of a direct connection to technology or engineering makes it less likely than agricultural/veterinary science.
* **Business Administration:**  This field has the weakest connection to the description. While intelligence and work ethic are valued in business, the other traits are less characteristic of the field's stereotype.
