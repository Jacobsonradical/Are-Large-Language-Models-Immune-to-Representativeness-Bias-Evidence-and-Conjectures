Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided is highly suggestive of one field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "computer science": "0.20",
  "business administration": "0.05"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily leans towards this field.  Love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work are all strong indicators of someone potentially in this field. 
* **Computer Science:** While intelligence and puzzle-solving ability are associated with computer science, the other traits (love for animals, interest in nature) are less common stereotypes. It's possible, but less likely based on the profile.
* **Business Administration:**  The personality sketch provides little to connect Adam to a typical business administration student. Empathy and a warm heart are valuable in business, but the core interests described don't align strongly.

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes. People's personalities and career choices are complex. It's entirely possible for someone with Adam's traits to thrive in any of these fields.
