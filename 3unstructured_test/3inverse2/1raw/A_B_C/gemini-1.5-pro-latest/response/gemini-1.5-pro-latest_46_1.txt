Here's a breakdown of the probabilities with explanations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The personality sketch strongly aligns with interests often found in these fields.  The love for nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work are all very suggestive of someone drawn to these areas of study.

* **Computer Science (0.3):**  While the sketch mentions enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, it lacks stronger indicators like an interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving using computational tools. 

* **Business Administration (0.1):**  The personality sketch provides very little indication of an interest in business administration. The traits mentioned (empathy, love for nature, etc.) are not typical drivers for choosing this field.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimates based on the provided personality sketch. Without more information about Adam and the specific programs he was considering, it's impossible to provide definitively accurate probabilities.
