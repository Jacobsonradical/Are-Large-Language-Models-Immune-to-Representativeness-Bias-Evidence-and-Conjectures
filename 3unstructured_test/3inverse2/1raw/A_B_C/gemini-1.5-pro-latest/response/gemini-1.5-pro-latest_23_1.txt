Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals. Combined with intelligence and an appreciation for hard work (common in agricultural fields), this field has the highest probability.
* **Computer Science:**  The puzzle-solving aptitude and comfort with abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential in computer science. This is a common field for intelligent individuals, making it somewhat likely.
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch doesn't offer strong indicators aligning with typical business administration traits. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the other traits point more strongly towards the other fields.

**Important Note:** Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. Many individuals with these traits could be found in any of these fields, and countless other factors influence career choices.
