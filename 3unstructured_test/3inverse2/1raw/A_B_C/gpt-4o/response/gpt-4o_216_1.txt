Based on the personality sketch, here are the estimated probabilities for each field, assuming Adam is enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:
- The subject’s curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
- While the subject’s high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit computer science, the description doesn’t emphasize traits typically associated specifically with this field as strongly.
- The subject’s traits do not align closely with attributes typically emphasized in business administration.
