{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's deep curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication align well with this field. Hence, a higher probability is assigned.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and his high intelligence with abstract concepts suggest that he could be suited for this field, but the linkage is less direct compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- **Business Administration**: This field seems less aligned with Adam's empathy, love for nature, and animals. Therefore, the probability is lower.
