Explanation: The personality sketch indicates a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as a strong sense of empathy and understanding. These traits are highly aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The interest in abstract concepts and problem-solving could also fit well with computer science, but the emphasis on nature and animals makes it less likely. Business administration seems the least aligned with the personality described, given the emphasis on empathy, nature, and a warm heart, which are not the typical primary focus in business studies.
