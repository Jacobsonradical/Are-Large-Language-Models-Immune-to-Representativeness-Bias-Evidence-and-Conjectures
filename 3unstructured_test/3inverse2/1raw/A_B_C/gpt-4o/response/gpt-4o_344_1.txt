Based on the provided personality sketch and the described interests and attributes of Adam, here are the probabilities that the sketch corresponds to Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "computer science": 0.50
}

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: High probability (0.75) as Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align well with this field.
- **Business Administration**: Low probability (0.10) because his interests and strengths do not align with typical focuses in business administration.
- **Computer Science**: Moderate probability (0.50) given Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, which are crucial for success in computer science. However, it is not as directly linked to his interest in nature and animals.
