Based on the personality sketch provided, the probability estimates for Adam being in each field (given he is in another field) might be as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

These probabilities reflect the alignment of Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work with agricultural and veterinary science, while his intelligence and problem-solving skills also fit computer science to some extent. Business administration seems less aligned with the given personality traits.
