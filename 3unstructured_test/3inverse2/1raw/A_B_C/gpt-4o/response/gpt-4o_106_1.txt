Sure, based on the personality sketch provided, I can make an estimate for each field in question:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals make agricultural and veterinary science the most fitting field, hence a higher probability (0.8).
- While Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills could suit computer science, his warm heart and empathy have a less direct connection, so a moderate probability (0.5).
- Business administration seems least aligned with his interests in nature and animals, strong empathy, and abstract thinking, suggesting a lower probability (0.2).
