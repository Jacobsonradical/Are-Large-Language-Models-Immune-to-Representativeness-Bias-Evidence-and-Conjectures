Based on the personality sketch provided and the characteristics that align with various fields of study, here are the probabilities that the sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Explanation:

- **Computer Science (0.2):** While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit computer science, the strong focus on nature, plants, and animals seems less aligned with this field.
  
- **Business Administration (0.1):** Adam's traits, such as empathy and appreciation for hard work, might be beneficial in business, but his deep curiosity about nature and animals does not strongly correlate with business administration.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** This field directly aligns with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. His empathy, appreciation for hard work, and high intelligence are valuable assets in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
