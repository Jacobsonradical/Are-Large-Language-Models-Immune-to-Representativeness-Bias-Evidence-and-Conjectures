- "business administration": The personality traits mentioned do not strongly align with business administration, leading to a lower probability of 0.2.
- "computer science": The subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are relevant traits for success in computer science, so a moderate probability of 0.5 is assigned.
