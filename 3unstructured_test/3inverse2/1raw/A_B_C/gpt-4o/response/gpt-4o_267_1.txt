Explanation:
- "business administration": The probability is relatively low because the personality traits described do not strongly align with the typical interests and skills associated with business administration. Adam's love for nature, puzzles, and animals suggests a stronger inclination towards fields that deal directly with these interests.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": The probability is high because this field aligns well with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals. His empathy and appreciation for hard work are also traits that would be beneficial in this field.
- "computer science": The probability is moderate because while Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit well with computer science, his strong connection to nature and animals is less directly related to this field. However, abstract thinking is a key component in computer science, providing some overlap.
