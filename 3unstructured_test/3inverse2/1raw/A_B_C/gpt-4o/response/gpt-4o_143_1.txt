Based on the provided personality sketch and considering Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, here are the estimated probabilities that this sketch pertains to Adam if he was not enrolled in the field mentioned:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, the probability that the sketch pertains to him if he is not enrolled in this field remains relatively high. His traits strongly align with interests typically associated with this field.
  
- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality traits (empathy, love for nature/animals, solving puzzles) do not strongly align with typical traits for Business Administration, thus the probability is low.

- **Computer Science**: Although less directly aligned than Agricultural and Veterinary Science, Adam's high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts give some probability that the sketch could still describe him, albeit less closely.
