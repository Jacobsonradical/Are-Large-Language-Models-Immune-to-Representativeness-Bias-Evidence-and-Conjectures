Given the personality sketch, it seems highly likely that Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, along with his love for animals and appreciation for hard work, would steer him towards agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also apply to computer science, but it doesn't align as strongly with his evident passions and interests. Business administration seems to be the least likely field based on the provided details.
