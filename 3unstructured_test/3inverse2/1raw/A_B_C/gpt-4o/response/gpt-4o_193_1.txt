Based on the provided personality sketch, I will estimate the probability that the sketch is about Adam, considering that Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question.

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Although Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which are traits that align well with computer science, his strong curiosity about nature and empathy are less directly relevant.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work fit very well with this field. His pursuits and personality traits align closely with what you might expect from someone in this discipline.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: This field is less likely given Adam's interests in nature, animals, and solving abstract puzzles, which are not typically central to business administration.
