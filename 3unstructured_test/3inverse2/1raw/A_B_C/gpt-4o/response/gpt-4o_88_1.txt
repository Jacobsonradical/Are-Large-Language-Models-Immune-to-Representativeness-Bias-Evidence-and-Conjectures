Explanation:
Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it's highly likely that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and empathy fit well with understanding animals and plants. Business administration seems quite unlikely due to the lack of any business-related traits in his personality sketch, so it's rated much lower. Computer science is somewhat plausible because of his problem-solving skills and ability to understand abstract concepts, but itâ€™s less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
