Based on the personality sketch provided, we can estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

### Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.1):** While Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be beneficial in business, the personality sketch leans more towards interests in nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which are not as directly aligned with business administration.
- **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators for computer science. Additionally, his love for solving puzzles fits well with the problem-solving nature of this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** The clear interest in nature, plants, and animals strongly aligns with this field. Combined with empathy and hard work, agricultural and veterinary science seems to be the best fit for Adam given the personality profile.
