Based on the personality sketch provided, here's the estimated probability that the sketch was about Adam if Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "computer science": 0.30
}

Explanation:
- "agricultural and veterinary science": The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly match the characteristics desirable in agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, there is a high probability that this field is closely aligned with the sketch.

- "business administration": The personality traits described do not strongly align with common traits associated with business administration such as a focus on finance, marketing, and managing businesses. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.

- "computer science": The subject's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence with an understanding of abstract concepts does align with computer science to some extent. However, the strong appreciation for nature and animals is less typical, making the probability moderate.
