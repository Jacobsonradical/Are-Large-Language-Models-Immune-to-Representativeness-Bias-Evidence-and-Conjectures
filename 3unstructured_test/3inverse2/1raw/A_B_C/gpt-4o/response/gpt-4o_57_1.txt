Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.8):** Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy aligns closely with this field, making it a strong candidate.
- **Computer science (0.6):** While not directly related to his interest in nature and animals, Adam's intelligence, abstract thinking, and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit well with the analytical nature of computer science.
- **Business administration (0.2):** Adam's traits do not strongly align with business administration, which typically requires more focus on economics, management, and human organizational skills rather than nature, animals, or abstract problem-solving skills.
