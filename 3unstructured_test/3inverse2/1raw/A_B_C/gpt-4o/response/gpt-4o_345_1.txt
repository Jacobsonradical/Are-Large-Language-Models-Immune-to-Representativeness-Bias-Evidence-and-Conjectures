{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Here's the rationale behind these estimates:

- **Computer Science (0.2):** While Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which are traits that match well with computer science, his profound empathy and love for nature and animals suggest a lesser likelihood.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong understanding of hard work, this field seems to align closely with his personality and interests.

- **Business Administration (0.1):** Although business administration might benefit from his intelligence and understanding of hard work, the field seems less aligned with his specific interests in nature, animals, and empathy.
