Given the personality sketch and noting Adam's qualities, we can estimate the likelihood of him being enrolled in different fields while aligning those qualities to the nature of each field. Here are the probabilities based on the provided sketch and the assumption that Adam was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

### Reasoning:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align closely with this field, making it a strong candidate if he weren’t already enrolled in it.
 
- **Computer Science (0.4):** While his high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles fit well with this field, the personality sketch emphasizes nature and animals more, which makes this field moderately likely.

- **Business Administration (0.2):** This field typically focuses less on topics related to nature and animals, and more on commerce, management, and economics, which do not align as closely with Adam's interests and qualities. Therefore, this is the least probable field based on the sketch.
