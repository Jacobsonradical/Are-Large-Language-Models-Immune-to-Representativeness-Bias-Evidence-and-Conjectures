# Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, this seems like a highly compatible field, which makes the probability fairly high.
- **Computer science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with a good grasp of abstract concepts, which are key traits for computer science. However, his love for nature and empathy might make this field slightly less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Business administration**: Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with the typical traits valued in business administration, such as a focus on leadership, management, and profit-driven goals. Hence, this has the lowest probability among the three fields.
