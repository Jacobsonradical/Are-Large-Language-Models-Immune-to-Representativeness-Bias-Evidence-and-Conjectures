Given the personality sketch, let's estimate the probabilities for each field considering Adam is enrolled in one of the other two fields at the given times.

1. **Computer Science**: This field requires strong abstract thinking and problem-solving skills, which aligns with Adam's high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles. However, it doesn't align as well with his love for nature, animals, and empathy.

2. **Business Administration**: This field typically requires strong interpersonal skills and a focus on management, economics, and related areas. It might not align well with Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals, although his empathy could be a useful trait in business. Still, the fit seems less strong compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field directly aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. His warm heart and empathy are also key traits for this field, making this a very probable fit.

So, here are the best estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4, 
  "business administration": 0.2, 
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
