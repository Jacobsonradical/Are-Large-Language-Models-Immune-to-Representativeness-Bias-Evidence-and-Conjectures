Explanation:
The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals along with high intelligence and empathy, which makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a highly probable field. While having qualities like curiosity and intelligence are necessary for "computer science," the specific nature-related interests and empathy make it less likely but still a possibility. "Business administration" is the least likely as it generally involves skills and interests that are more oriented towards management and less towards the natural sciences or abstract problem-solving related to nature and animals.
