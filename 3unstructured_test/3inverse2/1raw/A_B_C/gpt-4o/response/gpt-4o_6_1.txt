Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: While Adam has high intelligence and the ability to grasp abstract concepts—traits valuable in computer science—his strong empathy, genuine curiosity about nature, and deep love for animals suggest he's more aligned with a field involving living organisms.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns well with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy and appreciation for hard work. This makes it highly probable.
- **Business Administration**: Adam's interests and personality traits don't strongly align with the typical skills or passions associated with business administration. His empathy and love for nature seem less directly relevant to this field.
