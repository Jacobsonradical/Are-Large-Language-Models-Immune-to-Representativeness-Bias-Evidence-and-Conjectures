Explanation:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, and his strong empathy, this field seems highly aligned with his interests and personality traits.
- Business Administration: This field doesn't seem to align well with Adam's personality sketch, particularly his love for nature and animals, making it a less likely match.
- Computer Science: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts, which could fit well with this field, his primary interests in nature, animals, and empathy make it a less likely but still possible match.
