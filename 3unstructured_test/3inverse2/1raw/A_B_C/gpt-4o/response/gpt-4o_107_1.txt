Given the personality sketch, it is highly likely that Adam's interests and traits align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for dedication. Computer science is also a decent match due to his high intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving skills. Business administration seems the least likely field based on the personality traits described, although it's not entirely out of the question.
