Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: The subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align with the skills needed in computer science. Additionally, enjoying puzzles could be likened to problem-solving in programming. Hence, there is a significant probability here.
  
- **Business Administration**: The personality traits described do not strongly align with the typical traits and interests associated with business administration. The empathy, warm heart, and love for animals suggest a more nature-centered or people-focused field than business administration. Thus, this has the lowest probability.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subjectâ€™s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align strongly with this field. It matches the subject's described passions and interests the best, making it the most probable of the three.
