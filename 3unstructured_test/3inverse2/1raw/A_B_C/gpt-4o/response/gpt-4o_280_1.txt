Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The sketch describes a person with a strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, which aligns closely with the interests and skills typically associated with this field.
- **Computer science:** The subject enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and abstract thinking skills, which are relevant to computer science, though the absence of specific mention of technology or computing makes it a slightly less direct match.
- **Business administration:** The sketch makes no mention of interests typically associated with business; the personality traits described (e.g., empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature) do not strongly align with common characteristics needed in business administration.
