Explanation:
- Agricultural and veterinary science aligns closely with Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, making it a highly probable field for him.
- Computer science is also plausible given his intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts, although it doesn't align as strongly with his interest in nature and animals.
- Business administration seems the least likely field given the focus on empathy, nature, and animals in his personality sketch, which are not directly related to typical business administration themes.
