Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work suggest a strong alignment with this field, hence a higher probability.
- **Computer Science**: His interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, especially in understanding abstract concepts, makes this a plausible field, though less so than agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Business Administration**: Though Adam's empathy and understanding of dedication might be useful in business, the specific traits and interests described don’t strongly align with a focus on business administration, hence the lower probability.
