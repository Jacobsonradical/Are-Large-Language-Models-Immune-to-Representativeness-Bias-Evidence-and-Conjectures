Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: While Adam has high intelligence and an aptitude for abstract concepts which suits computer science, his strong empathy, love for animals, and nature-based curiosity make this field less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field directly aligns with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Therefore, it is the most probable field.
- **Business Administration**: Adam's attributes do not strongly align with typical qualities for business administration. Hence, it has the lowest probability among the three.
