Sure, here are my estimates based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, and strong empathy, this field seems highly likely.
- **Business Administration**: Despite Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work, the personality sketch does not strongly align with typical traits for business administration, making it less likely.
- **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts well, which are key traits for computer science, making it reasonably likely but not as compelling as agricultural and veterinary science.
