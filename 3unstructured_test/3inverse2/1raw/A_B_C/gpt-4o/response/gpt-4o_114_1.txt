Sure, based on the personality sketch and considering Adam is in a different field than the one in question, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

These estimates are based on the alignment of Adam's interests and skills with the typical requirements and focus areas of these fields. Adam's empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align most closely with agricultural and veterinary science, while his enjoyment of solving puzzles suggests a potential fit with computer science. Business administration seems the least likely given his primary interests and characteristics.
