- Business administration: The subject's interests and traits don't strongly align with the typical traits associated with business administration. The likelihood is therefore quite low (0.1).
- Computer science: While the subject enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which are traits conducive to computer science, the stronger inclination towards nature and animals suggests a moderate probability (0.5).
