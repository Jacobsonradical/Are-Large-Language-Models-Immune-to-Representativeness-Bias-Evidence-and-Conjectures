**Explanation:**
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** The personality sketch aligns strongly with this field. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are directly relevant to agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Computer Science (0.6):** While not directly aligned with his love for nature and animals, his intelligence, abstract understanding, and enjoyment of puzzles fit well with the analytical and problem-solving skills required in computer science.
- **Business Administration (0.3):** This field is less aligned with his described interests and personality traits. Although business administration requires intelligence and sometimes an appreciation for hard work, it does not closely match his love for nature, animals, or solving puzzles in the same way the other two fields do.
