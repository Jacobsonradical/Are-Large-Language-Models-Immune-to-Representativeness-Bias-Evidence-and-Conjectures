Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the best estimates of the probability that the sketch was about Adam if he were enrolled in a field other than the one in question:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.20
}

These estimates are based on the following reasoning:

- "Agricultural and veterinary science": The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, which is highly consistent with fields related to agriculture and veterinary science. Hence, the probability is high.

- "Business administration": The personality sketch does not align well with typical traits or interests found in business administration, such as a focus on commerce, leadership, or organizational skills. Thus, the probability is low.

- "Computer science": The subject's love of solving puzzles and high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts could suggest an aptitude for computer science. However, the specific interests in nature and animals make this field less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the probability is moderate.
