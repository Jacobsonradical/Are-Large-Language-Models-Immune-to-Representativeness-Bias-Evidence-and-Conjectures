Given the information provided in the personality sketch and the general nature of the fields in question, here is the probability estimate for each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

- **Computer Science**: A probability of 0.3 because while computer science requires high intelligence and problem-solving skills (which match the personality sketch), the deep love for nature and animals isn't a primary focus in this field.
- **Business Administration**: A probability of 0.1 because it doesn't align well with Adam's deep interest in nature, plants, and animals, or his quiet personality and empathy.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: A probability of 0.7 because this field closely matches Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong understanding of hard work and dedication relevant to these sectors.
