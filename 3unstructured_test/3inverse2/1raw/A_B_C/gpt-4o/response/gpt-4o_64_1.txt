Explanation:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8)**: The subject’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work aligns well with a field focused on agriculture and veterinary science. High probability is appropriate here given the strong match with personality traits.
  
- **Computer Science (0.5)**: The subject’s interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence make computer science a plausible option. However, the specific emphasis on nature and animals is less directly related to computer science, suggesting a moderate probability.

- **Business Administration (0.2)**: The subject’s described interests and empathy are less directly related to business administration, which typically focuses more on management, economics, and organizational behavior. The lower probability reflects the weaker alignment with the personality sketch.
