Given the personality traits and interests described in the sketch, Adam seems to have a strong inclination towards fields related to nature, animals, and possibly problem-solving. 

- **Computer Science**: Although his interest in abstract concepts and puzzles could suggest a leaning towards computer science, his deep love for animals and nature suggests that it's a less likely match.
- **Business Administration**: His characteristics and interests strongly emphasize nature, animals, and empathy, which are not typically the core focus in business administration. Hence, this is the least likely field for him.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns well with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, making it the most probable match for him.
