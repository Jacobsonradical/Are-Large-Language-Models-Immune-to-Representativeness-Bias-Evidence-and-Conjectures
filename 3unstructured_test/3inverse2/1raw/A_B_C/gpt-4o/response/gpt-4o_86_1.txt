Explanation: 

- **Business Administration (0.2)**: As a field, business administration is less directly associated with a deep love for nature, plants, animals, and high empathy, which are all primary characteristics of the subject. While Adam might still be enrolled in this field, the personality sketch is less indicative of someone studying business administration.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: This field strongly aligns with the subject's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as a genuine curiosity about these topics. The empathy and appreciation for hard work further complement the typical traits of someone in agricultural and veterinary sciences, making it a more probable fit.

- **Computer Science (0.5)**: While computer science prominently involves high intelligence and a better understanding of abstract concepts—traits Adam possesses—the direct connection to nature and animals is less evident. However, the subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles can be closely related to problem-solving in computer science, making it a potentially plausible but less strong fit compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
