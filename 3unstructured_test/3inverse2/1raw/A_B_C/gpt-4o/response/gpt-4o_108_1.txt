Given Adam's personality sketch, it's most likely that he aligns with fields that involve nature, animals, and potentially complex problem-solving and abstract thinking. Considering this, we can estimate the probabilities for the given fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Adam's character traits such as genuine curiosity about nature and empathy do not strongly align with the typical interests and skills valued in business administration.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work make this field a strong match.
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, particularly in abstract concepts, lends itself to a moderate probability in this field, but his passion for nature and animals suggests it is not his primary interest.
