Given the personality sketch of Adam, here's my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: While Adam has high intelligence and empathy, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals doesn't strongly align with the primary focus of a business administration program.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, combined with his love for animals and empathy, makes this field a highly probable match.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns with the cognitive skills often seen in computer science, but his primary interests in nature and animals suggest a lower probability compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
