**Explanation:**

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and his strong empathy and love for animals, there's a high probability that he could be associated with this field. The characteristics mentioned align well with a passion for and pursuit of knowledge in agricultural and veterinary science.

- **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam is described as having high intelligence and an affinity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are critical skills in computer science. While nature and animals are not directly related to typical computer science domains, his intellectual traits make this field a fairly possible match.

- **Business Administration (0.2):** Adam's traits don't strongly correlate with typical business administration characteristics. While he may appreciate hard work, the quiet, puzzle-loving, and empathetic nature doesn't align closely with the more extroverted, network-focused personality often seen in business administration. Thus, the probability is relatively low.
