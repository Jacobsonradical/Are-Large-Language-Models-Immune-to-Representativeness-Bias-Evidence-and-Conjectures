Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my best estimate of the probability that the sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation:
- Business Administration: The subject's traits such as a deep love for animals, high empathy, and a genuine curiosity about nature do not strongly align with the typical characteristics associated with business administration. Therefore, the probability is relatively low. 

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: The subject's interest in nature, plants, and animals highly aligns with this field, making it the most likely match. Therefore, the probability is quite high.

- Computer Science: While the subject is good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, which aligns with skills often required in computer science, the other interests in nature and animals are less directly related. Thus, the probability is moderate.
