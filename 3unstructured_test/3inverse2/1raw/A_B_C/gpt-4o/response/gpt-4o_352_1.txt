Explanation:

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, this field strongly aligns with his personality. Therefore, the probability is relatively high at 0.8.
  
- **Computer science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are traits that can be beneficial in computer science. However, his primary interests seem to lean more towards nature and animals, so the probability is moderate at 0.5.
  
- **Business administration**: This field seems the least likely considering Adam's personality traits and interests. His empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not strongly align with the typical focus of business administration. Thus, the probability is lower at 0.2.
