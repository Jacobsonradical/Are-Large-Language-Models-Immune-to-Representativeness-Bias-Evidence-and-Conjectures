Based on the personality sketch provided, we can make the following estimations regarding the likelihood that the personality sketch was about Adam if Adam was enrolled in a different field:

1. **Business Administration**: The traits described—such as a love for animals, empathy, and curiosity about nature—do not strongly align with the typical interests and skills associated with business administration. While it's certainly possible that an individual in business administration could exhibit these traits, they are not commonly highlighted in this field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns very well with the personality sketch. A deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all characteristics that fit well with a career in agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Computer Science**: The traits of high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, the empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature typically do not correlate as directly with the field of computer science.

Given these considerations, my estimates are as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.4
