Explanation: 
The subject's personality sketch indicates a strong preference for nature, plants, animals, and hands-on work, which aligns closely with fields like agricultural and veterinary science. The probability for this field is therefore quite high. While the subject possesses high intelligence and an aptitude for abstract concepts, which are important in computer science, the connection to nature and a warm, empathetic disposition make it less likely. Business administration seems the least likely field given the subject's clear inclination towards nature and animals.
