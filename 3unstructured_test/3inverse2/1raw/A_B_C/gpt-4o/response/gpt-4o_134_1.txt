  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

- **Computer Science**: While Adam's high intelligence and problem-solving skills are a fit, his empathy and love for animals suggest a slightly lower probability.
- **Business Administration**: This field is less likely due to Adam's deep appreciation for nature and lack of mentioned interest in business or administrative skills.
