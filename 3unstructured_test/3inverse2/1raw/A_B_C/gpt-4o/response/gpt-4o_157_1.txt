Explanation: Given the personality sketch, Adam's traits align most closely with fields that emphasize an interest in nature, plants, animals, and problem-solving. Hence, the highest probability is assigned to agricultural and veterinary science. While computer science could also fit due to his high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, the connection is less direct than agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration is the least likely given the sketch does not emphasize relevant traits typically associated with that field.
