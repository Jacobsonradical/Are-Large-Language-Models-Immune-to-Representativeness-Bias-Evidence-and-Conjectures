Based on the information provided, here are my estimates of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam if Adam was enrolled in different fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These probabilities are based on the congruence between the personality traits described and the typical interests and activities associated with each field. The high curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication make agricultural and veterinary science the most likely match.
