Given the personality sketch and the specific interests and traits mentioned, here is an estimation of the probabilities that the personality sketch corresponds to Adam, assuming Adam is not enrolled in the fields mentioned:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Business administration (0.2)**: While there could be a few business administration students who have an interest in nature and empathy towards animals, this field generally attracts individuals more interested in human-centric activities like management, economics, and corporate environments. Hence, it's a less likely match for a personality defined by curiosity about nature and animals.
  
- **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.8)**: This field makes a strong connection with Adam's personality traits. With a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an appreciation for dedication, it seems highly probable that Adam could be associated with this field.
  
- **Computer science (0.5)**: Adam's intellectual capabilities, love for solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts do align well with computer science. However, the emphasized aspects of nature and animals are less typical in computer science studies, making this a moderate probability.
