Based on the personality sketch and the context provided, the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field can be inferred by considering how well the personality traits and interests align with those fields. Here's the estimated probability for each:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

### Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: While Adam's strengths in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science, his primary interests in nature, plants, and animals suggest that this field is not as likely as agricultural and veterinary science.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: This field strongly aligns with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, making it the most likely field.
  
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Adam's personality traits and interests do not particularly align with business administration compared to the other fields. There's little in the sketch to suggest a strong fit with business studies, making it the least likely field.
