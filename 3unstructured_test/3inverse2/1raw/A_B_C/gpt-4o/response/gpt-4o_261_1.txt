Based on the personality sketch provided, we can estimate the probability for each field given Adam's characteristics. Here's my best estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

### Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.3):** Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, both of which are valuable traits in computer science. However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature suggest a greater likelihood of him being interested in fields more directly related to these passions.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, and his deep love for animals, this field seems most aligned with his interests and characteristics.
- **Business Administration (0.1):** While Adam's understanding and appreciation for hard work are relevant to business administration, the emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy does not strongly align with the typical focus of a business administration program.
