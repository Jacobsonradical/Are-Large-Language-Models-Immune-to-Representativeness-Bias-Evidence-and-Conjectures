Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, and his strong empathy, it is highly probable that the personality sketch pertains to a student in this field. This discipline aligns well with his interests and characteristics.
- **Business administration**: This field is less aligned with Adam's profile. Business administration typically requires different personality traits and interests than those described in the sketch, such as a focus on finance, management, and organizational strategy, rather than nature and animals.
- **Computer science**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence with abstract concepts suggest a fairly good fit with computer science. However, the lack of explicit mention of technology or programming and the dominant interest in nature and animals makes this less probable than agricultural and veterinary science but still a reasonable possibility.
