Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation: 

- **Computer Science (0.2)**: Adam's high intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles align with traits often found in computer science students. However, the sketch doesn't mention a strong interest in technology or programming, which limits the probability.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work make this field a strong match. His empathy and warm heart also align well with a career focused on animal care and agricultural development.

- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While his intelligence and understanding of hard work could be beneficial in business, the personality sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with business studies, such as a strong interest in economics, finance, or organizational leadership.
