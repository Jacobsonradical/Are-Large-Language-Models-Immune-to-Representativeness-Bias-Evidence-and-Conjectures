Explanation: Adam's deep love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his strong empathy and appreciation of hard work, make him a strong match for a field closely related to these interests, such as agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, although his problem-solving skills and high intelligence could suit a computer science field, the sketch does not emphasize a passion for technology that would make this a higher probability match. Business administration does not align well with his described traits and interests, suggesting a lower probability.
