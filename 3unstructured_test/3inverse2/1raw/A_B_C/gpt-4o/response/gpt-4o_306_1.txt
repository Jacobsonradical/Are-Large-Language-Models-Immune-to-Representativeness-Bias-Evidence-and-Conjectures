Explanation:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.9)**: Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, which aligns very closely with this field. His empathy and love for animals also suggest that this would be a very fitting field for him.

- **Computer Science (0.6)**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts—traits beneficial in computer science—his predominant interests in nature, plants, and animals make this option less likely but still plausible.

- **Business Administration (0.2)**: Adam's personality traits and interests do not strongly align with business administration, which is generally not focused on nature, plants, or animals. His empathy and warm heart might help in a managerial role, but it seems less connected to his core interests and curiosities.
