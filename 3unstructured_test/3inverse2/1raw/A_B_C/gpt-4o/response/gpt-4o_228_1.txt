Based on Adam's personality sketch, we can estimate the probability that he belongs to each of the given fields. Considering his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his empathy, and love for animals, certain fields seem more fitting than others:

1. **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, it is plausible that he could excel in computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals suggest a preference for a field more closely related to nature. Thus, the probability of him being a computer science student is moderately low.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns very closely with Adam's interests and personality traits. His curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals all suggest a natural fit in agricultural and veterinary science, making this probability very high.

3. **Business Administration**: While Adam's high intelligence and understanding of hard work could certainly allow him to succeed in business administration, his interests and personality traits seem more aligned with nature and animals rather than corporate or administrative roles. Hence, the probability here is comparatively lower.

Therefore, the probabilities can be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
