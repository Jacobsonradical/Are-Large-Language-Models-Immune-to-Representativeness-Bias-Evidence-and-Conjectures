Sure, here are the probabilities based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These estimations are based on how well the fields align with the subjectâ€™s personality traits and interests. The subject's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as their empathy and understanding of hard work, makes agricultural and veterinary science a highly probable match. The skills in solving puzzles and high intelligence suggest a possibility of interest in computer science, though it doesn't align as closely with the subject's interests. Business administration seems the least likely, given that it doesn't particularly align with the depicted naturalistic curiosity and empathy for animals.
