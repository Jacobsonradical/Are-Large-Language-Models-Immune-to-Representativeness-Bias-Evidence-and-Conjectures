Based on the personality sketch provided, here are my best estimates of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, if Adam was enrolled in a field different from the one in question:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each estimate:

- **Computer Science:** Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts make a case for computer science, but his primary interests seem to lean more towards nature, plants, and animals, which are less central to computer science.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** This field aligns closely with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, understanding of hard work and dedication, empathy, and love for animals, making it the most likely field related to his personality sketch.

- **Business Administration:** Adam's traits do not strongly align with those typically emphasized in business administration. While his intelligence and understanding of hard work could be assets in this field, the sketch suggests a stronger alignment with fields involving nature and animals.
