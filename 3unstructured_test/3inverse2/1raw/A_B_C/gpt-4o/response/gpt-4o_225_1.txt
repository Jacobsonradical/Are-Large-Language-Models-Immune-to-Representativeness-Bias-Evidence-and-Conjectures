Given Adam's personality sketch—which describes a person with a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high intelligence—it seems more likely that Adam would be enrolled in fields related to natural sciences, particularly those that involve animals and plants. 

Using this information, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

- **Business Administration (0.1)**: This field seems less aligned with Adam's interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, despite his high intelligence.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: This field is highly relevant to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart. It also matches his appreciation for hard work and dedication.
- **Computer Science (0.2)**: Adam’s high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts can be well-suited to computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
