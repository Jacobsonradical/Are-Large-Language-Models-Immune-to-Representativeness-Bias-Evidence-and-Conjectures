Based on the personality sketch, let's estimate the probability that the sketch describes Adam if he were enrolled in a different field than the one in question. Here are my best estimates:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These estimates are based on Adam's love for nature, animals, and his strong empathy, which align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also point towards computer science to some extent, as solving puzzles and understanding abstractions is essential in that field. Business administration seems less likely given the description, as it typically involves different skill sets and interests.
