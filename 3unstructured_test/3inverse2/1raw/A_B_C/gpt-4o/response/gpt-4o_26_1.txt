Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: While the subject has high intelligence and is good at abstract concepts, the primary interests in nature, plants, and animals align less directly with computer science. However, the problem-solving aspect and the ability to understand abstract concepts do fit well within this field.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: This field aligns most closely with the subject's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals. The strong empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication also fit well here.

- **Business Administration (0.1)**: This field is less likely given the subject's primary interests and personality traits. While intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are useful in business administration, the focus on nature, animals, and empathy suggests that this is not the most probable field for Adam.
