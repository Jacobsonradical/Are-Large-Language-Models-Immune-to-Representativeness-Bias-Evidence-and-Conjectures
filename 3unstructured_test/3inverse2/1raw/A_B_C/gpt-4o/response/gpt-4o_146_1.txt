Explanation: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, warm heart, empathy, and love for animals strongly align with a field like agricultural and veterinary science, where these traits are especially relevant and beneficial. Although his high intelligence and abstract thinking might also make him a good candidate for computer science (especially in areas like artificial intelligence or bioinformatics), the specific interest in nature and animals makes this slightly less likely but still plausible. On the other hand, while understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication can be relevant in business administration, the personality traits and interests described are not as strongly aligned with this field, making it the least likely of the three.
