Given the personality traits described and taking into consideration the interests and characteristics of the subject, my estimates of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, had he been enrolled in fields other than the one in question, are as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The personality sketch does not strongly align with the traits often associated with business administration students, such as a focus on management, finance, or corporate environments. The subject's qualities of empathy and curiosity about nature are less commonly tied to this field, hence a lower estimate.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field closely matches the subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. Therefore, this field is highly probable, but since the assumption is that Adam is enrolled in a different field, the probability is not a perfect 1.

- **Computer Science**: The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence aligns well with the typical interests in computer science. However, the strong empathy and love for nature and animals are less directly related to this field, leading to an intermediate probability.
