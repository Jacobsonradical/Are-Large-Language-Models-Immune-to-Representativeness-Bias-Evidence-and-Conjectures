Based on the personality sketch provided, we can estimate the probabilities for each field as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with his warm heart and strong empathy, this field aligns closely with his interests and personality traits. His high intelligence and understanding of hard work are also beneficial in this field. Hence, there's a high probability.
  
- **Computer science:** While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are important skills in computer science, his deep love for nature and animals suggests that this field is less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, the probability is moderate.

- **Business administration:** Without specific traits related to business acumen or a particular interest in business-related activities, this field is the least aligned with Adam's described personality. Therefore, we place a lower probability on this field.
