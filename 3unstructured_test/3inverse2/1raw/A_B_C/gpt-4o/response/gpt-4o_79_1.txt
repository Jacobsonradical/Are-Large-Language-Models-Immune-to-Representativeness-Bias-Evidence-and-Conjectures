Explanation:
- Agricultural and veterinary science: The personality sketch of Adam aligns well with someone who has a deep curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and a strong appreciation for dedication and hard work, which are essential traits in this field.
- Business administration: The traits described (love for animals, curiosity about nature, empathy) are less likely to align with a field that is more focused on management, finance, and operations.
- Computer science: While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit this field, the sketch emphasizes nature, animals, and empathy, which are less directly related to computer science.
