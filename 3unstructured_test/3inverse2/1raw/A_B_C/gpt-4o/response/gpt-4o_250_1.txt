Based on the personality sketch provided, the probability estimates for each field, given that Adam was enrolled in a different field, are as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.20
}

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this field is the most aligned with his interests and personality traits.
- **Business administration**: This field seems the least likely because it typically requires a different set of interests and skills—such as a focus on business strategy, management, and economics—which do not align well with the personality sketch provided.
- **Computer science**: While the problem-solving aspect and high intelligence could fit, Adam’s strong empathy, love for nature, and animals suggest a lower probability for this field compared to agricultural and veterinary science. However, the interest in abstract concepts keeps this field somewhat plausible.
