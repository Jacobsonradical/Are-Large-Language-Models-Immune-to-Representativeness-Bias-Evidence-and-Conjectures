Explanation:
Given the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong affinity for nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the probability for agricultural and veterinary science is higher. 

His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also make computer science a plausible but less likely field because it does not align as closely with his evident passion for nature and animals.

Business administration, however, seems the least likely given his interests in nature, empathy, and solving puzzles, which do not align strongly with the typical interests and skills associated with business administration.
