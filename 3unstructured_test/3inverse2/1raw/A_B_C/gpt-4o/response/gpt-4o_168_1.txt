Based on the provided personality sketch, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The personality sketch details a strong curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and a genuine appreciation for hard work and dedicationâ€”all traits that are highly relevant to this field.

- **Business Administration**: The personality traits described do not particularly align well with a typical interest in business administration, making it less likely (though not impossible) that Adam would be enrolled in this field.

- **Computer Science**: The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, the stronger emphasis on nature and animals slightly reduces the likelihood in comparison to agricultural and veterinary science.
