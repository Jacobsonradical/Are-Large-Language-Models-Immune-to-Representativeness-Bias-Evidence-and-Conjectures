  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.25
}

Explanation:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy highly correlates with this field. This makes agricultural and veterinary science a strong candidate with a probability of 0.75.
   
2. **Computer Science**: While the subject's intelligence and problem-solving skills fit well with computer science, the specified interests in nature and animals are less directly related. Therefore, I have estimated the probability as 0.6.
   
3. **Business Administration**: This field seems less likely given the subject's interests and personality traits, which are more aligned with scientific and empathic pursuits than business management. Hence, the probability is relatively lower at 0.25.
