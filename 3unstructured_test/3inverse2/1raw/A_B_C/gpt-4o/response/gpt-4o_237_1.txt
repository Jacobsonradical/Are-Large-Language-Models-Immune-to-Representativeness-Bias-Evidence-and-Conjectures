Explanation:
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication, there is a high probability that he might be enrolled in this field. Hence, the estimate is quite high at 0.75.
- "computer science": Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could be in a field like computer science, though his specific interests in nature and animals make this less likely than agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the probability is moderate at 0.5.
- "business administration": Although Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, his interests in nature, animals, and solving puzzles make business administration less likely. Therefore, the probability is lower at 0.2.
