Based on the personality sketch provided and the characteristics described, the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each of the different fields is estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
```

These estimates are derived considering that Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align most closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and interest in solving puzzles may also be a fit for computer science, but the traits described are less typical for business administration.
