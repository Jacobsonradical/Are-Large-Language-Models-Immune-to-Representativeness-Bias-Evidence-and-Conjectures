Based on the provided personality sketch and the information about Adam, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

These estimates derive from the subject's strong affinity for nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and problem-solving skills can apply across various fields, but business administration seems less likely given the lack of related traits. Computer science is a plausible option due to his intelligence and abstract thinking skills, but it does not specifically align with his pronounced interest in nature and animals.
