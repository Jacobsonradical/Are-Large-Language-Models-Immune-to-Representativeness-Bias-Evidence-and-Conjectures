}

### Rationale:
1. **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.8)**: The strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication fit very well with this field. The subject’s personality traits suggest a high likelihood of being drawn to a discipline directly related to plants and animals.

2. **Computer science (0.5)**: The enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence are traits beneficial for computer science. However, the specific interest in nature and animals makes this field slightly less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Business administration (0.2)**: Although high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts can be useful in business, the subject’s deep empathy, love for animals, and nature-oriented curiosity do not align as closely with the typical interests and skills associated with business administration.
