Explanation: 

- "Computer Science": The subject's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence aligns with skills needed for computer science. However, the strong nature and animal empathy aspect makes it a less likely candidate, thus the probability is lower.
  
- "Agricultural and Veterinary Science": The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals directly aligns with this field. Consequently, this option has the highest probability.

- "Business Administration": While empathy and understanding abstract concepts are good traits for business administration, the sketch focuses more on nature and animals, which are not typically central to business studies. Hence, this probability is the lowest.
