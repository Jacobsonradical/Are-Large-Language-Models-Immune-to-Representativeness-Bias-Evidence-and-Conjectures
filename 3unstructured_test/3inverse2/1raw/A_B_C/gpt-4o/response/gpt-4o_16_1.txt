Given the personality sketch and considering that Adam is a graduate student in the U.S., I have estimated the probabilities for each field based on the described characteristics.

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:

- **Computer Science (0.2):** Although Adam is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which aligns with skills useful in computer science, his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy do not strongly align with the typical profile of a computer science student.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals are highly consistent with a student in agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for the hard work and dedication aligns well with the demands of this field.

- **Business Administration (0.1):** While Adam's high intelligence and understanding of hard work might be beneficial in business administration, his personality sketch does not strongly align with the typical interests and motivations of a business student.
