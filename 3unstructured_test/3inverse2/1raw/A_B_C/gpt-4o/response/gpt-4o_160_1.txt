These estimates are based on the alignment of the personality traits with the respective fields. The strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature suggest a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science. Meanwhile, having high intelligence and being good at abstract concepts fits well with computer science, albeit slightly less aligned with his warm heart and empathy. Lastly, business administration seems the least likely given the personality sketch, but itâ€™s still possible as some traits like high intelligence and problem-solving ability are relevant.
