Note: These probabilities reflect an assessment based on the personality traits and interests described. Adam's deep love for animals and curiosity about nature align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the higher probability for that field. His intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles also suggest a moderate likelihood of interest in computer science. His traits seem less directly related to business administration, but it's not entirely ruled out, leading to a lower probability for that field.
