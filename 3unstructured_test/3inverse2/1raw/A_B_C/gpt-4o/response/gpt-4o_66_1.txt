Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work, there is a high probability that he could be enrolled in this field.
- **Computer science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence suitable for abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, his strong empathy and love for animals suggest a somewhat lower probability.
- **Business administration**: With Adam's focus on nature, animals, and empathy, business administration seems the least likely as his primary field.
