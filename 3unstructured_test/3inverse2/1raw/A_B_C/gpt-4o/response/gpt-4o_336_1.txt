  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

The reasoning behind these estimates is as follows:

- **Computer science**: While Adam has a high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which are traits that align well with computer science, his deep love for animals and curiosity about nature's plants don't directly align with the typical interests of a computer science student. However, there is still a notable probability given his intelligence and problem-solving skills.

- **Business administration**: The traits described, such as a warm heart, empathy, and a deep love for animals, and nature, are less characteristic of someone pursuing a field like business administration. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication, this field aligns very well with his personality sketch, leading to a higher probability estimate.
