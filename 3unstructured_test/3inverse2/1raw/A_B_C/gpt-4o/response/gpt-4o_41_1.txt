Given the described personality sketch, here are the estimated probabilities that Adam is enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

### Reasoning:
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Adam's high intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles align well with the analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science. However, there's no direct mention of an interest in technology or programming.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication closely match the characteristics often seen in individuals pursuing agricultural and veterinary sciences. The sketch very strongly suggests a natural inclination towards this field.

- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work could serve him in business administration, the lack of any interest or mention of business concepts or leadership traits makes this less likely compared to the other fields.
