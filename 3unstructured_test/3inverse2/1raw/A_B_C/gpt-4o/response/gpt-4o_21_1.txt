Explanation:
- The subject's interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as their empathy and love for animals, make it highly probable that they are in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
- While understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles are skills that align well with computer science, the subject's pronounced interest in nature and animals makes this less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business administration is the least likely field based on the personality traits described, as it typically does not heavily emphasize the subject's primary interests and strengths.
