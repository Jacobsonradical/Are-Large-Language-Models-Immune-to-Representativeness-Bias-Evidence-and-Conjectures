{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Here's the reasoning behind these estimates:

- **Computer Science (0.2)**: While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit a field like computer science, his personality sketch highlights a strong connection to nature, animals, and empathy, which are not typically the primary focus in computer science. Thus, the probability is somewhat lower.
  
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Business administration often requires a different set of interests and skills such as leadership, strategic planning, and organizational management, which are not explicitly described in the personality sketch. The emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals makes business administration a less likely field for Adam.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, agricultural and veterinary science aligns closely with his interests and personality traits. Therefore, this field has the highest probability of being related to the personality sketch.
