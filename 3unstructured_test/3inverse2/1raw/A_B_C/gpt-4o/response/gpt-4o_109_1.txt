Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, he could potentially be a student in computer science. However, the emphasis on nature, plants, and animals doesn't strongly align with this field, so the probability is moderate but not high.
- **Business Administration**: This field seems less likely given Adam’s strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature. These traits are not generally emphasized in business administration, so the probability is lower.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field appears to be the most likely given Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. Therefore, the probability is high.
