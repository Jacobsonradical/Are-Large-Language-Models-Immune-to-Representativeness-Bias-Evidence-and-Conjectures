Based on the personality sketch provided, here are my estimates for the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, considering that Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

### Explanation:

- **Business Administration (0.1)**: The characteristics described in the personality sketch do not strongly align with those typically necessary or emphasized in business administration. The focus on nature, plants, empathy, and a deep love for animals suggest that Adam would be less likely to be in this field compared to others.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8)**: The personality sketch suggests a high probability that Adam could be interested in this field. His genuine curiosity about nature and plants, coupled with a deep love for animals, aligns strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. 

- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and his high intelligence make computer science a plausible field. However, his deep love for animals and nature suggests that this is not the most likely field compared to agricultural and veterinary science but still a reasonable possibility.
