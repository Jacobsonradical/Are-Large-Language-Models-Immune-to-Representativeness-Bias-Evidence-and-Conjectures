Given the personality sketch, here are the probabilities of the personality being about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: With his love for nature, plants, and animals, plus a deep appreciation for hard work, this field seems highly likely for Adam.
- **Computer science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, both of which are important in computer science, making this a reasonably likely field for him.
- **Business administration**: This field doesn't align as closely with his demonstrated interests and empathy towards animals and nature, making it the least likely among the three.
