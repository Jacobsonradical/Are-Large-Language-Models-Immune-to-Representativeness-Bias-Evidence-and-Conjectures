The reason for these estimates is that Adam's personality sketch aligns well with the traits and interests commonly found in someone studying agricultural and veterinary science, such as a strong connection to nature, plants, and animals, combined with empathy and a genuine curiosity about nature.

He could also be in computer science given his high intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles, as computer science often requires strong problem-solving skills and the ability to understand abstract concepts.

However, business administration is less likely given Adam's specific interests and personality traits, which don't align as well with the typical focus areas of business studies. Nonetheless, there's still some probability (0.2) as people with various interests can pursue business degrees for diverse reasons.
