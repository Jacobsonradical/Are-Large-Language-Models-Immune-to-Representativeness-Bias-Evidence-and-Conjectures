Explanation:

- **Business Administration (0.1)**: The personality sketch describes someone with a deep connection to nature, empathy for animals, and an interest in abstract concepts. These traits align less with the typical focus areas of business administration, which is more oriented towards management, finance, and organizational skills.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8)**: The subject’s genuine curiosity about nature and plants, combined with a love for animals, makes agricultural and veterinary science a highly probable field of study. This field aligns well with the described interests and personality traits.
