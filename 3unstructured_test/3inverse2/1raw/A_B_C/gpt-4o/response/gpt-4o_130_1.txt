Reasoning:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems highly probable that he is in this field. The characteristics described match well with someone interested in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
- **Computer Science**: Although Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with an understanding of abstract concepts, which fits well with computer science, the personality sketch emphasizes nature, animals, and empathy more, making this field slightly less probable.
- **Business Administration**: This field seems the least probable for Adam based on the personality sketch. The emphasis on empathy, animals, and nature does not strongly align with the general characteristics often associated with business administration.
