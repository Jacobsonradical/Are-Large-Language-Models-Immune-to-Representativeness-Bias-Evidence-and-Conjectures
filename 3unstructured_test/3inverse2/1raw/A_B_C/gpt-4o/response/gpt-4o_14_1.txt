- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems highly likely that he might be enrolled in this field.

- **Computer Science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are traits beneficial for computer science, the specific focus on nature and animals makes this less probable, though still plausible.

- **Business Administration**: Adam's traits such as empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not directly align with the typical focus areas of business administration. Hence, the probability is comparatively lower.
