Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.2):** While business administration can involve solving complex problems, it is generally less connected to nature, plants, and animals, reducing the likelihood that personality sketch fits Adam if he's studying this.
- **Computer Science (0.4):** This field is aligned with high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, but is somewhat less directly connected to a genuine curiosity about nature and animals. Nevertheless, Adam's appreciation for puzzles and analytical skills might relate well to computer science.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** This field fits the sketch best, given the subject's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work related to these areas. Therefore, it's more probable that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was in this field.
