Based on the personality sketch provided and the fields in question, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

The personality and interests described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work) align more closely with those typically associated with agricultural and veterinary science. The fit is slightly less perfect but still plausible for computer science, given the subject's intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles. Business administration appears less likely given the personality and interests described.
