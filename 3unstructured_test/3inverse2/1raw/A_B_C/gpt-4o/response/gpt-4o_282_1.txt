Here is a brief explanation for each estimate:

- **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.8):** Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong understanding of the hard work involved, this field seems highly relevant to his personality traits.
- **Computer science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, particularly in understanding abstract concepts, suggest that he could also be drawn to computer science. However, the connection is less direct compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Business administration (0.3):** While Adam's empathy and intelligence could benefit him in this field, his specific interests in nature, animals, and solving puzzles make it a less likely match for his personality.
