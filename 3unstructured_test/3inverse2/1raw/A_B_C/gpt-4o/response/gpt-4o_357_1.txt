The estimates are based on Adam's personality sketch, which shows that he has a strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and a genuine curiosity about nature and plantsâ€”characteristics that are highly relevant to agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles suggest he might also fit well in computer science, where abstract thinking and problem-solving skills are valuable. However, his traits seem less aligned with the typical attributes associated with business administration.
