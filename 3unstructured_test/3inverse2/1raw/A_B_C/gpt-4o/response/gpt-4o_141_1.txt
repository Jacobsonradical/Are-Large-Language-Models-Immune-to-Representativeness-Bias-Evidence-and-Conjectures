Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's traits and interests appear to be strongly aligned with certain fields more than others. Here's an estimated probability for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

The probability estimates reflect the strong alignment of Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. However, it's also possible for someone with his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills to be in computer science, although it is less likely. Business administration seems the least likely given his described traits and interests.
