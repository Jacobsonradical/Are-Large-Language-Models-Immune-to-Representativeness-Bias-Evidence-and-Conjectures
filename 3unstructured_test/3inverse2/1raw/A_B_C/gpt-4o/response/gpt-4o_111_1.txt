**Rationale:**

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it appears highly likely that he could be involved in a field that directly engages with these interests.
  
- **Business Administration**: This field appears quite unlikely given Adam’s characteristics. There is not much alignment between his personality sketch and the typical nature of business administration studies.

- **Computer Science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are relevant to computer science, his deep love for nature and animals makes it somewhat less likely, though still possible, that he is in this field relative to agricultural and veterinary science.
