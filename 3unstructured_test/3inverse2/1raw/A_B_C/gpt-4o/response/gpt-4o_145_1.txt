Based on the personality sketch provided, including Adam's love for nature, animals, solving puzzles, and his understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, here is an estimation of probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "computer science": 0.30
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.15)**: The personality traits and interests of Adam, such as his strong curiosity about nature and love for animals, don't strongly align with the typical focus areas and motivations for someone pursuing business administration.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.70)**: Given Adam's deep love for animals, strong empathy, and genuine curiosity about nature, this field seems highly relevant. It fits well with his interests and personality traits.
- **Computer Science (0.30)**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, which are traits that align with computer science, his strong connection to nature and animals makes this field less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science. However, there is still some possibility due to his interest in abstract concepts and problem-solving abilities.
