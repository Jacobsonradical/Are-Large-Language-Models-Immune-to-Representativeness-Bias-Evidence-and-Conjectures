Here is my best estimate of the probabilities based on the personality sketch provided, if Adam were enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

Explanation:
1. **Business Administration**: Given Adam's strong empathy, curiosity about nature, and love for animals, it seems less likely that he would be drawn to a field that is heavily focused on corporate strategies, profit maximization, and other aspects of business. Thus, I assign a relatively low probability.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for plants, and deep affection for animals point strongly towards this field. His empathy and appreciation for hard work align well with the demands and values in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Thus, I assign a high probability.

3. **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest a good fit for computer science, which involves a lot of abstract thinking and problem-solving. However, the lack of direct reference to technology reduces the probability somewhat compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, I assign a moderate probability.
