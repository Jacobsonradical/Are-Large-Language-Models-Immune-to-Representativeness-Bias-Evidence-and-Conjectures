Explanation: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals, it seems likely that he would be drawn to agricultural and veterinary sciences. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts make a background in computer science possible, but not as aligned with his interests in nature and animals. Business administration seems the least likely, as it doesn't align well with his described interests and personality traits.
