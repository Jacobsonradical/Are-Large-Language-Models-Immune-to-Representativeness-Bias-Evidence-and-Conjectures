Certainly, based on the personality sketch and given Adam's traits and interests, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These estimates are based on the following reasoning:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, combined with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, makes it highly probable that he could be studying in this field.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence, especially in abstract thinking, suggest a moderate possibility that he could be studying computer science.
- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with typical traits associated with business administration, making it less likely that this is his field of study.
