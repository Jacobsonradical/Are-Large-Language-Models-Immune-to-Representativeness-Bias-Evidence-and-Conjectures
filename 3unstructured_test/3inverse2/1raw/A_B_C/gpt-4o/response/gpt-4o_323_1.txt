Explanation:
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his empathy, and love for animals, it is highly likely that this personality sketch fits someone in this field.
- "business administration": This field does not align well with the personality traits described, such as a love for nature, animals, and puzzles.
- "computer science": Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts make computer science a possible fit, although it doesn't align as closely as agricultural and veterinary science with his love for nature and animals.
