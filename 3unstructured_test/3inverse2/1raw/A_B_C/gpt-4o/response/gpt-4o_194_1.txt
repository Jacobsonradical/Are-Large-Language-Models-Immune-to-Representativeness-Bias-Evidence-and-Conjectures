Sure, based on the personality sketch and interests of Adam, here's my estimated probability for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These probabilities take into account Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his intelligence in understanding abstract concepts.
