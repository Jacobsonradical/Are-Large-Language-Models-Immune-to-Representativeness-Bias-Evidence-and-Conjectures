Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: While the subject has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are important traits for computer science, his strong empathy and love for animals are not typically strongly associated with this field, resulting in a lower probability.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with a career in agricultural and veterinary science, resulting in a higher probability.
- **Business Administration**: The subject's empathy and warm heart could be beneficial in business, particularly in leadership and team environments, but the focus on nature, plants, and animals makes it less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science, leading to a lower probability.
