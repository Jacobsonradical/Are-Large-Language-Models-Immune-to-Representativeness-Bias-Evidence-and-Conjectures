Based on the personality sketch provided and considering Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, the following are the estimated probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These estimations are based on Adam's strong curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, which align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. While his high intelligence and abstract thinking capabilities might also suit computer science, his personality traits less evidently align with business administration.
