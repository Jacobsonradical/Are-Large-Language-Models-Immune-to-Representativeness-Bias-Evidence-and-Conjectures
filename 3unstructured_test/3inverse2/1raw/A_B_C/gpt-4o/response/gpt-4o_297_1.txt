Based on the personality sketch provided, here are my best estimates for the probability that the sketch could be about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation: 
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his love for animals strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science, leading to a higher probability here.
- His high intelligence, affinity for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts are well-suited for computer science, giving it a moderate probability.
- Business administration seems less likely given the personality sketch, particularly because it doesn't closely align with his strong empathy for nature and animals, resulting in a lower probability.
