Given the information in the personality sketch, here are the probabilities for each field if Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The personality sketch emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which doesn't closely align with typical characteristics of business administration students. Hence, the probability is relatively low.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field strongly aligns with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, making it highly probable.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with computer science, so the probability is moderate.
