Explanation:
- "Agricultural and veterinary science" seems quite fitting given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals.
- "Computer science" is a possibility due to the subject's high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, though it is less closely aligned with his empathy and love for animals.
- "Business administration" seems less probable given that the described personality traits don't strongly align with typical interests and skill sets commonly associated with this field.
