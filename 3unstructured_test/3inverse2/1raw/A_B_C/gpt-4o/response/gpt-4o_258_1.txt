Sure, based on the personality sketch, here are my estimates of the probability that the description is about Adam if he were enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The personality sketch focuses on a love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which doesn't strongly align with the typical interests and motivations of someone in business administration. Hence, the low probability.
- **Computer Science**: The intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts fit well with computer science, although the empathy and love for nature and animals are less directly related. Thus, a moderate probability.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns very closely with the personality sketch, particularly the curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. Hence, the high probability.
