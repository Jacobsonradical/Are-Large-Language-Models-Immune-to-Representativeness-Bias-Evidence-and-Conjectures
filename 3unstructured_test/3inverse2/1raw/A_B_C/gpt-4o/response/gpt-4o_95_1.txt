Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The high probability (0.7) is due to Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work which resonates well with this field.
- **Business Administration**: The low probability (0.1) reflects the lack of direct connections to Adam's interests in nature, puzzles, and animals, making it less likely his field of study.
- **Computer Science**: While the fit is not perfect, the moderate probability (0.4) acknowledges his high intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, and ability to grasp abstract concepts, which are all relevant to this field. However, his strong connection with nature and animals makes it less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
