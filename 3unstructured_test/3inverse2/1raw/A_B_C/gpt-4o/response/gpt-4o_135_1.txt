  "computer science": 0.3, // While Adam's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could fit well in computer science, his strong interest and empathy for nature and animals make this field less likely.
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7, // Given Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work, this field seems highly relevant to his interests and personality.
  "business administration": 0.1 // Business administration generally does not align well with Adam's described traits and interests in nature, animals, and puzzles, making this field the least likely match.
