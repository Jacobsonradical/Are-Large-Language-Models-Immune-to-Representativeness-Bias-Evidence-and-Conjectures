Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Given Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and interest in puzzles, it seems less likely that he would be in a purely business-oriented field. Hence, a lower probability of 0.1.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field matches very well with Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, empathy, and understanding of hard work and dedication. Therefore, a high probability of 0.7.
- **Computer Science**: While Adam's high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills could fit well in this field, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature might suggest a somewhat weaker fit compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, a moderate probability of 0.2.
