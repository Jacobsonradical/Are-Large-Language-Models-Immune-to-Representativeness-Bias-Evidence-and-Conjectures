Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, he seems well-suited for this field. This makes it highly probable that Adam could be studying something related to agriculture, animals, or veterinary science.
  
- **Computer Science**: The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence are strong indicators for computer science as well, where logical reasoning and abstract thinking are essential. Therefore, this field is also a reasonable fit for Adam.

- **Business Administration**: While Adam's understanding and appreciation for hard work might match with business administration, the other traits outlined in the personality sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) are less directly relevant to this field, making it less likely compared to the other two fields.
