Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: A probability of 0.3 reflects that while Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking can align with computer science, his deep connection to nature, animals, and empathy lean slightly away from this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: A probability of 0.7 is the highest because Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work fit well with this field.
- **Business Administration**: A probability of 0.1 reflects the fact that while Adam's understanding and appreciation for dedication might be useful in business, his other characteristics (like curiosity about nature and love for animals) are less directly relevant to this field.
