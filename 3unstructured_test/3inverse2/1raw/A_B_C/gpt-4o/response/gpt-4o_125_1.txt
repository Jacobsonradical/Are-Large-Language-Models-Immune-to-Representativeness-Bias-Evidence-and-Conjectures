Based on the personality sketch provided, the likelihood of Adam's field of study can be estimated as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:
- **Computer science (0.3)**: While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit computer science, his deep love for nature, animals, and empathy do not align as closely with typical computer science interests.
- **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a warm heart with empathy for animals strongly suggests a fit for agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Business administration (0.1)**: Although business students can be intelligent and hard-working, the specific interests in nature and animals make this field a less likely match for Adam's personality.
