### Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, deep love for animals, and empathy, it seems highly likely that he would be in a field closely related to these interests.
  
- **Business Administration**: This field seems highly unlikely for Adam given his personality sketch, which does not mention any particular interest in business practices, administration, or interactions that tend to dominate this field.

- **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, both of which might incline him toward a field like computer science. However, his passions for nature, plants, and animals suggest this is less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
