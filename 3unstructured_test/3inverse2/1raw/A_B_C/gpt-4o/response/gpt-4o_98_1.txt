}

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, there is a high probability that the personality sketch aligns well with someone in this field. An estimated probability of 0.8 reflects this strong correlation.
  
- **Business administration**: While it's possible that someone in business administration can embody these traits, it seems less likely given the specific interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. Thus, the probability is relatively low at 0.2.

- **Computer science**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence make computer science a plausible field for him. However, the deep love for nature and animals is less directly connected, making this probability moderate at 0.5.
