Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the best estimations of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

- **Business Administration (0.1):** The subject's interests and traits (such as a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work) do not strongly align with the typical characteristics of someone in business administration. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The subject's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals aligns well with this field. These traits suggest a significant chance that the personality sketch could describe someone in this area of study.

- **Computer Science (0.2):** While the subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could be relevant to computer science, the other interests and traits such as a love for nature and animals suggest that this is less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
