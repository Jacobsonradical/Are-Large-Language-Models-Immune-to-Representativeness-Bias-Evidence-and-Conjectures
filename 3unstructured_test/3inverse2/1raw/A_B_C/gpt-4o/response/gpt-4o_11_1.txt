Based on the provided personality sketch and field relevance, here are the probability estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The subject's interests and personality traits, such as a curiosity about nature, love for animals, and solving puzzles, do not strongly align with business administration, which often focuses more on management, finances, and organizational skills. Hence, the probability is low.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given the subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, this field is highly relevant. Therefore, the probability is high.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence might fit well with computer science, but the strong emphasis on nature and animals makes this less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the probability is moderate.
