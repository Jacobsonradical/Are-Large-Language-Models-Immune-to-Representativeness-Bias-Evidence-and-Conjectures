The reasoning follows from the given personality traits: Adam's high curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align most closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence could lean towards computer science, but not as strongly as the former. Business administration seems the least likely given the personality attributes described.
