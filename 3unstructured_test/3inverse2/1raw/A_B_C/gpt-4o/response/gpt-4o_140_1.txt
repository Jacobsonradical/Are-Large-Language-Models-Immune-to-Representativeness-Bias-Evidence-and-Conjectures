The subject's genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, as well as his deep love for animals, strongly align with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. These characteristics suggest a higher probability that the personality sketch could be about Adam if he were not specifically enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

On the other hand, business administration seems unlikely given that the subject's interests and personality traits do not particularly align with the typical focus and activities associated with this field. Hence, there is a low probability.

For computer science, while the subject's high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles could fit, other aspects of his personality sketch, such as his empathy and love for nature, are not as clearly related. Therefore, this field has a moderate probability.
