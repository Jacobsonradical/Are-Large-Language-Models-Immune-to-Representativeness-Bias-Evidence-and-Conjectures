Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimates for the probability that Adam, a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

These probabilities are based on how well the personality traits align with each field:
- Adam's strong curiosity about nature and love for animals strongly indicate a high probability for agricultural and veterinary science.
- His intelligence and skill in understanding abstract concepts, as well as enjoying solving puzzles, suggest a notable probability for computer science, but his empathy and warm heart are somewhat less typical for that field.
- Business administration seems less likely given the lack of alignment with Adam's core interests and personality traits.
