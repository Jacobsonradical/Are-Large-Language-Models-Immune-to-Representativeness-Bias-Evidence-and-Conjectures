Here are the probability estimates that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These estimates reflect the idea that the personality traits described—such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an understanding and appreciation for hard work—are most closely aligned with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. While an appreciation for abstract concepts and high intelligence might fit computer science to some extent, the specific empathy and nature-related interests make business administration the least likely.
