Certainly. Based on the personality sketch provided, here's my estimation of the probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

The reasoning behind these values is as follows:
- The traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science, which leads to a higher probability for this field.
- The abstract thinking and puzzle-solving ability could be relevant to computer science, giving it a moderate probability.
- Business administration seems less aligned with the subject's primary interests and traits, resulting in a lower probability.
