Based on the personality sketch, the subject has a strong affinity for nature, animals, and understanding abstract concepts. This suggests that he might be more inclined towards fields that involve nature and animals rather than business. Here's my estimate of the probability for each field if Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These values are reflective of the fact that agricultural and veterinary sciences align more closely with his interests and personality traits, while computer science and business administration are less aligned but still possibilities given his intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
