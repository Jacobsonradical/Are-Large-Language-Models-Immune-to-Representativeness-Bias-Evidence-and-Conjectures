Based on the provided personality sketch, here's an estimated probability for each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, plants, and his empathy and love for animals, this field seems like a strong fit, hence a high probability of 0.8.
- **Business administration**: This field does not align well with Adam's described interests and traits, such as a love for nature, plants, and animals, leading to a low probability of 0.1.
- **Computer science**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence with an understanding of abstract concepts align moderately well with this field, hence a probability of 0.5.
