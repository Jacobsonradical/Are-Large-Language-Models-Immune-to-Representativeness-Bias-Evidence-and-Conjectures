**Explanation:**

- **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The personality sketch highlights Adamâ€™s genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, all of which strongly align with interests and qualities typically found in someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.

- **Computer science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with computer science, his empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature are less directly related. Nonetheless, his puzzle-solving enjoyment and intellectual capabilities suggest a reasonable fit.

- **Business administration:** This field is the least likely based on the sketch. While business administration requires intelligence and an appreciation for hard work, the primary focus on nature, animals, and empathy in the personality sketch does not strongly correlate with typical interests and skills in this field.
