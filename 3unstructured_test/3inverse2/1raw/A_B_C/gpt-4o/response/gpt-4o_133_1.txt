Sure, based on the personality sketch provided, here's the estimated probability for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These estimates are based on the fact that Adam shows a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with empathy and a warm heart, which closely align with fields involving agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also suggest a potential interest in computer science, albeit to a lesser degree. However, his personality traits seem less aligned with business administration.
