Based on the personality sketch provided and the fields in question, here are the probabilities that the sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a different field than the one mentioned:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it's highly probable that the sketch describes someone in this field.

2. **Business Administration (0.1)**: While the traits mentioned, such as high intelligence and empathy, are valuable in business, the specific interests in nature and animals make it less likely.

3. **Computer Science (0.5)**: The interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with skills needed in computer science. However, the focus on nature and animals makes it a moderate probability that he would be in this field.
