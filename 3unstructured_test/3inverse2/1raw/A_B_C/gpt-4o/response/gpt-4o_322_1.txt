Sure, here is an estimate of the probabilities based on the personality sketch provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These probabilities reflect that the personality traits described in the sketch align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science due to Adam's love for nature, animals, and his strong empathy, which are typically associated with those fields. The probability for computer science is somewhat moderate because of his high intelligence and adeptness at solving puzzles, which are relevant in that field. The probability for business administration is lower as the personality traits described align less directly with typical traits for that field.
