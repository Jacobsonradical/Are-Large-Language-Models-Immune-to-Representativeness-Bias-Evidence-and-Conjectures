Explanation:
- **Business Administration:** Given the personality traits of empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it's less likely that Adam is studying business administration, as these traits align more closely with fields that involve nature and animals.
  
- **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts make computer science plausible, his deep love for animals and nature makes this a less likely fit compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** This field aligns most closely with Adamâ€™s deep love for animals, his empathy, and his curiosity about nature, making it the most probable field of study for him.
