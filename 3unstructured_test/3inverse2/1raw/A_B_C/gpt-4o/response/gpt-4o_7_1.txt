Explanation:
- "agricultural and veterinary science": The personality sketch indicates a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, coupled with empathy and a warm heart, which fits well with agricultural and veterinary sciences. Hence the higher probability.
- "computer science": The subject's high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles align with the skills needed in computer science. However, the deep love for nature and animals is less directly related to computer science, resulting in a moderate probability.
- "business administration": The traits described in the sketch (curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals) are less commonly associated with business administration. Although intelligence and an appreciation for hard work are relevant, the overall fit is weaker, leading to a lower probability.
