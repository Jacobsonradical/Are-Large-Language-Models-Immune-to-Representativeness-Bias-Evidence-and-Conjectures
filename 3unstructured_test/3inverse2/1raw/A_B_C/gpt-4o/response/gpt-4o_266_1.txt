Explanation: 

- The subject's deep love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy strongly align with a field like agricultural and veterinary science, suggesting a high probability.
- The subject's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts might fit computer science, but it does not align as well with his other personality traits, so the probability is moderate.
- Business administration seems less likely given the subject's interests and personality traits, which lean more towards natural sciences and problem-solving rather than business-oriented perspectives.
