Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and aptitude for natural sciences, particularly related to plants and animals. They also seem to have an analytical mind good at abstract thinking and problem-solving. 

While these traits could fit with computer science to some degree, I think they align most strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. The curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication point in that direction.

Business administration seems least likely based on the personality description, as it doesn't highlight any strong interest in business, leadership, finance, etc. The abstract thinking ability could be useful in business to some extent though.

Computer science has some overlap in the problem-solving and abstract reasoning aspects, so I gave it a moderate probability. But overall, agricultural and veterinary science seems to be the best fit if Adam was not actually studying in that field. Of course, this is just an estimate based on limited information in the personality sketch.
