Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a relatively high probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are somewhat compatible with computer science, but less directly relevant than for agricultural and veterinary science, so I assigned a moderate probability.

Business administration seems the least likely based on the personality sketch, as the mentioned traits don't strongly align with typical characteristics and interests of business students. However, I still assigned a non-zero probability since the sketch provides limited information to fully rule it out.
