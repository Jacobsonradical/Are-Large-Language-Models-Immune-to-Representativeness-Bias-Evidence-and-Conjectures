Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. 

Enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science, but is less directly relevant than the nature and animal interests, so I assigned a moderate probability.

While the subject's appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to business administration, the other traits seem less directly applicable, so I assigned the lowest probability to that field based on the personality sketch.
