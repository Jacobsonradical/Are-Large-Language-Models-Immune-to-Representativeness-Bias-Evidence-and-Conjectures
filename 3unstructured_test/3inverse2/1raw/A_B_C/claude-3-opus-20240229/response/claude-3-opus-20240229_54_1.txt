Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, animals, and abstract problem solving. This fits well with agricultural and veterinary science. The interest in abstract concepts and puzzles also suggests potential compatibility with computer science. Business administration seems less likely given the emphasis on nature, animals and abstract thinking over other traits. However, the dedication and hard work mentioned could fit with any demanding graduate program.
