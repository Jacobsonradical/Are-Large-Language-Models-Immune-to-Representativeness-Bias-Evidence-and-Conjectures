Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Explanation:
- The subject's love of nature, plants and animals, as well as empathy, suggests a high probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science.
- The subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts suggests a moderately high probability of being in computer science.  
- While the subject appreciates hard work and dedication which is important for business, the other traits seem less directly relevant, so I estimated a lower probability for business administration relative to the other two fields.
