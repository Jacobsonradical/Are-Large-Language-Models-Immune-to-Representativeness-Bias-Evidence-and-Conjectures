Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was actually enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, animals, and a warm and empathetic personality. This seems to align most closely with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. 

The abstract thinking and intelligence could fit with computer science to some degree, but the overall profile seems less aligned with typical computer science traits and interests.

Business administration seems the least likely fit, as the sketch doesn't mention anything about leadership, entrepreneurship, finance, or other common business-related traits and interests.

Of course, this is just a rough estimate based on the limited information provided. The actual field of study can't be determined conclusively from a brief personality sketch alone.
