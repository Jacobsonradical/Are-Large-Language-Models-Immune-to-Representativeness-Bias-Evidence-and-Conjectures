Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest a higher probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts give a moderate probability that he was studying computer science.

The appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to business administration to some degree, but the other traits seem less directly relevant, so I assigned a lower probability to that field.
