Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in and empathy for animals and plants, as well as an appreciation for hard work, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science, but the overall profile seems less strongly aligned. Business administration seems the least probable based on the personality description, though the dedication and hard work mentioned could be applicable. Of course, these are rough estimates based on limited information.
