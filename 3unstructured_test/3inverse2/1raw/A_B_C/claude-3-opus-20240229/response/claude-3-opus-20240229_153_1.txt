Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who loves nature, plants and animals which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. Problem solving skills and abstract thinking abilities could fit with computer science. The sketch provides less evidence of business acumen or interest, so I assigned the lowest probability to business administration. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
