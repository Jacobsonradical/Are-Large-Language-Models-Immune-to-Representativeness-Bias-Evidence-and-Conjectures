Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who loves nature, plants and animals which points more towards agricultural and veterinary science. The mentions of curiosity, intelligence and understanding abstract concepts also fit well with computer science. Business administration seems less likely given the personality traits described, although not impossible. These are subjective estimates based on limited information.
