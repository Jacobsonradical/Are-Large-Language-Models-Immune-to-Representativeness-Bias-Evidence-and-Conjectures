Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy, seem to align most closely with agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also suggest a good fit for computer science. While business administration is certainly a possibility, the personality sketch provides fewer direct indications of traits commonly associated with that field.
