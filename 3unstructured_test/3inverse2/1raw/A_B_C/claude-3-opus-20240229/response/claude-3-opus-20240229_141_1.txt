Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a high probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts point to a moderate probability of studying computer science.

While business administration students can certainly possess the mentioned traits, there aren't strong indicators in the description that directly align with typical business administration skills and interests, so I assign a lower probability to that field relative to the others.
