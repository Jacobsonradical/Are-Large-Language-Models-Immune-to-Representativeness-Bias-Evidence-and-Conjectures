Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a higher probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to the other fields.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and being good at understanding abstract concepts somewhat fit with computer science, but not as strongly as with agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits seem least aligned with business administration, but the mention of understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication still makes it a possibility, albeit lower than the other two fields.
