Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals suggests a high probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. 

Their intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science, but the other traits seem less directly relevant, so I assigned a moderate probability.

Business administration seems least likely given the personality description, as it doesn't mention anything about interest in business, management, finance, etc. So I gave that the lowest probability estimate.
