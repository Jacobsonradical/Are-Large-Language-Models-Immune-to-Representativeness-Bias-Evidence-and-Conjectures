Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest a relatively high probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are somewhat associated with computer science, so I assign a moderate probability to that field.

Business administration seems less likely given the personality description, as traits like curiosity about nature and love of animals are not as strongly associated with business. However, the understanding of hard work and dedication has some relevance.
