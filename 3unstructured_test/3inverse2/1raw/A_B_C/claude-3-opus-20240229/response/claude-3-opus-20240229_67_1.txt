Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, given the personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his deep love for animals, suggests a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science.

His ability to solve puzzles and understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, although the sketch does not specifically mention an interest in technology.

While the subject's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business administration, the overall personality sketch seems less directly related to that field compared to the others.
