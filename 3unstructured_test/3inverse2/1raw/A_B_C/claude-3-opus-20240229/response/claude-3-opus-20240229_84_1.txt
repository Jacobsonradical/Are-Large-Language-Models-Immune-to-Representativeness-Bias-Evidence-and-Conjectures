Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a different field than the one specified:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch suggests that the subject has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a deep love for animals. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. 

While traits like curiosity, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work could apply to many fields, the specific mention of understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree.

The description seems to have the least overlap with typical traits and interests of someone in business administration.
