Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is highly intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles, which could fit well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy also seems to align very closely with agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration seems less likely given the personality description, but the dedication and hard work mentioned could lend itself to business. So I judge agricultural and veterinary science as most probable, followed by computer science, and then business administration as least likely of the three fields for this individual.
