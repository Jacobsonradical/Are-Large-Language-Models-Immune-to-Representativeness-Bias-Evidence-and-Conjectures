Here is my estimate of the probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2", 
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have interests and traits that align most closely with agricultural and veterinary science, given his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. Computer science is also a possibility given his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, as well as enjoying solving puzzles. Business administration seems less likely based on the description, but his intelligence and work ethic could lend themselves to that field as well. The probabilities are estimates based on limited information.
