Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract thinking. This aligns most closely with agricultural and veterinary science, so I assign that the highest probability at 0.8.

The subject's intelligence and skill at understanding abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, so I give that a moderate probability of 0.4. 

While business administration requires intelligence and hard work, the other traits don't seem to align as directly, so I assign that the lowest probability at 0.2. Problem-solving skills could be relevant, but overall the profile seems less suited to business compared to the other two fields.
