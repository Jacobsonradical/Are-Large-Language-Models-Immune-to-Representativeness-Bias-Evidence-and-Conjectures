Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was not actually enrolled in that field:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love of nature, plants, animals, and a warm heart and empathy, which seems to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The comment about being good at understanding abstract concepts and puzzles could potentially fit with computer science. The traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to business administration, though of course people of all personalities can be found in any field. The probabilities are just my best estimate based on the limited information provided.
