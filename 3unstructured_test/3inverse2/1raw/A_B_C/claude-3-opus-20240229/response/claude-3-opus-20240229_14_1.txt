Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals suggests a higher probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Their intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science as well. The personality traits seem less directly related to business administration, so I assigned that a lower probability.
