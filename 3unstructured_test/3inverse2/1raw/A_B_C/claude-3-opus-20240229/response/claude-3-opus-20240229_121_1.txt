Here is my estimate of the probabilities:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who loves nature, plants and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles also suggests an aptitude for computer science. Business administration seems less likely given the personality traits described, but the appreciation for hard work and dedication means it can't be ruled out entirely.
