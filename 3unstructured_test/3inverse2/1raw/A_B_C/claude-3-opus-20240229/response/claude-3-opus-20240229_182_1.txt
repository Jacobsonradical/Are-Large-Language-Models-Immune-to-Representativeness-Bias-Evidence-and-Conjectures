Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The subject's love of nature, plants and animals, as well as their empathy, suggests a high probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. 

Their intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, along with enjoying puzzles, points to a fairly high likelihood of studying computer science.

While the subject appreciates hard work and dedication which could apply to business, overall their personality seems less suited to business administration compared to the other two fields. However, it's still a possibility.
