Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.5"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a high probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. 

Their interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science, but is less strongly indicative than the nature/animal affinity.

While business administration requires dedication and hard work, which the subject is said to appreciate, overall the personality sketch provides fewer clues pointing specifically to business compared to the other two fields.
