Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong affinity for nature, animals, and hard work, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit well with computer science, but to a lesser degree than agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration seems the least likely based on the personality sketch, as it doesn't strongly emphasize traits commonly associated with that field. However, the subject's intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could still make business administration a possibility.
