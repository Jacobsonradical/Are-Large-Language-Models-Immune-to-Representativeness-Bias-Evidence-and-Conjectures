Here is my estimate of the probabilities in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants and animals, as well as an analytical mind good at abstract thinking and problem solving. This aligns most closely with agricultural and veterinary science.

Computer science is also a possibility given the subject's intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts and problem solving. However, the sketch doesn't mention anything specific to computers or technology. 

Business administration seems the least likely fit, as the personality traits and interests described don't line up as directly with typical business fields, although the work ethic and intelligence could be applicable. The probabilities reflect my estimation based on the limited information provided.
