Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a relatively high probability of around 0.6 that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts give a moderate probability of around 0.3 that he was studying computer science.

Finally, the empathy, warm heart and dedication traits give a lower but non-zero probability of around 0.2 that he may have been studying business administration.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information in the personality sketch. More details about Adam's specific interests and aptitudes would be needed for a more definitive assessment.
