Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a higher probability that Adam is studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts point to a moderate probability of studying computer science.

Business administration seems less likely given the personality sketch, but the mention of understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication leaves open the possibility, hence a lower but non-zero probability estimate.
