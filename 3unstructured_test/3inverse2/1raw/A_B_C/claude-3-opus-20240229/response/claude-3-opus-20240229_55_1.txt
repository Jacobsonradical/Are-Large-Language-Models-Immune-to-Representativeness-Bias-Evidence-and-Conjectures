Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a higher probability of around 0.7 that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts lend themselves to fields like computer science, so I estimate a moderate probability of 0.4 for that.

Business administration seems less likely given the personality description, but the general intelligence and dedication could still apply, so I assign a lower probability of 0.2 for that field.
