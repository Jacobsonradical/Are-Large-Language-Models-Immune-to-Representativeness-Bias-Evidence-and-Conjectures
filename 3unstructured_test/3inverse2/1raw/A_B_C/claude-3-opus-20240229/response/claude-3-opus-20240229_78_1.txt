Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is very interested in and empathetic towards nature, animals, and plants. They also enjoy problem-solving and have a strong work ethic. This profile seems to align most closely with a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.

There is also a reasonable probability they could be studying computer science, given the mention of high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles. Problem-solving skills are very applicable in that field.

I view business administration as the least likely fit based on the details provided. While dedication and hard work are certainly relevant, the other traits and interests mentioned seem to point more towards the other two fields in my estimation.
