Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. Their intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science. The mention of understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication could potentially align with business administration, but the other traits seem less directly relevant, so I assigned it a lower probability.
