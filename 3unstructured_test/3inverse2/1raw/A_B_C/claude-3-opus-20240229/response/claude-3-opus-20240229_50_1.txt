Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest and aptitude for agricultural and veterinary science, given the subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. This field seems to align well with the described traits.

Computer science is also a possibility, as the subject enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with an understanding of abstract concepts. However, the sketch does not explicitly mention an interest in technology or programming.

Business administration seems less likely based on the provided information, as the sketch does not highlight any particular interest in management, finance, or entrepreneurship. However, the subject's intelligence and appreciation for hard work could still make this field a possibility.
