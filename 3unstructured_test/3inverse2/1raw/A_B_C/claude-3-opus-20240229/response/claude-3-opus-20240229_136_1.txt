Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science. While the strong work ethic and dedication mentioned could be applicable to business administration, the other traits seem less directly relevant to that field compared to the other two, so I assigned it a lower probability.
