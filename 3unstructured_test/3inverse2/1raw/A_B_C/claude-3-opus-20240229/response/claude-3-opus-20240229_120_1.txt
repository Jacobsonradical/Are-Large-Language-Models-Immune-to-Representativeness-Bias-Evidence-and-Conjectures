Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and a love for animals. This fits well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend itself to computer science, though the overall sketch seems less aligned with that field.

Business administration seems the least probable based on the personality profile, as it doesn't mention anything about leadership, entrepreneurship, finance, or other common traits and interests found in that field. Problem-solving and dedication could be relevant, but overall the sketch points more to other areas.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information. The individual could certainly be enrolled in and successful at any of these fields, regardless of their personality traits and interests.
