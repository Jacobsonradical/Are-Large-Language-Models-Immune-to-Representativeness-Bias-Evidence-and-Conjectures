Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality sketch, the subject seems to have a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, animals, and abstract problem solving. This aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. 

The subject's high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree, but the sketch doesn't specifically mention an interest in technology or computers.

Business administration seems the least likely fit, as the personality traits and interests described don't align as strongly with typical business-oriented skills and pursuits. However, the subject's appreciation for hard work and dedication could translate to the business world to some extent.
