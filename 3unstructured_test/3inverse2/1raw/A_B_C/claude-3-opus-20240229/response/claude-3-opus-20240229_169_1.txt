Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, given the personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and empathy for nature, animals, and abstract thinking. This aligns most closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. 

The interest in puzzle solving and abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree, but the overall profile seems less aligned with that field.

Business administration seems the least likely fit given the personality traits and interests described, which don't focus on leadership, extroversion, competitiveness or other stereotypical business-oriented attributes.

Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information and stereotypes. The probabilities are meant to reflect general tendencies and likelihoods rather than definitive assessments of the individual. The actual field of study could certainly deviate from these guesses.
