Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a high probability of around 0.8 that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also fit well with computer science, so I estimate a probability of around 0.6 for that field. 

Business administration seems less likely given the emphasis on nature, animals and abstract concepts in the sketch, so I estimate a lower probability of around 0.3 for that field of study.
