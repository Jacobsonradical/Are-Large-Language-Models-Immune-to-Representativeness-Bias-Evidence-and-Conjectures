Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest a higher probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also suggest a reasonably high probability of studying computer science.

The personality sketch provides less evidence to support Adam studying business administration compared to the other two fields.
