Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a higher probability of Adam being in the agricultural and veterinary science field. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also suggest a decent probability of being in computer science. Business administration seems less likely given the emphasis on nature, animals, and abstract thinking over typical business-related traits.
