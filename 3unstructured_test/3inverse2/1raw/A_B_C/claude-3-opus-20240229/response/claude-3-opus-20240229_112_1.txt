Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science, but the overall profile seems less aligned with that field. Business administration seems the least likely fit based on the personality description provided.
