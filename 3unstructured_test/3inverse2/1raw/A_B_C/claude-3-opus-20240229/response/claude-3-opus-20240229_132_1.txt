Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest a higher probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts also fit well with computer science, giving it a somewhat elevated probability.

Business administration seems less probable given the personality description, but the mention of understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication slightly raises the likelihood compared to a field not mentioned at all.
