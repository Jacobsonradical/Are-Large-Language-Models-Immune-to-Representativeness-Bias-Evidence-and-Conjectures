Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to the other fields.

The traits of high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles are somewhat relevant to computer science, leading to a moderate probability estimate.

While the strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are positive traits, they seem less specifically tied to business administration compared to the other fields based on the personality sketch. So I assigned the lowest probability to that field.
