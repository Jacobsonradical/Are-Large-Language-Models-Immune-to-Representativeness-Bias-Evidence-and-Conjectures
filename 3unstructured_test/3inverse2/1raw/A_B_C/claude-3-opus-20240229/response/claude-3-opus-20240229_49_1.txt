Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love for nature, plants and animals, as well as empathy, which suggests a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science, but the other traits mentioned are less directly relevant, so I estimated a moderate probability.

Business administration seems least probable given the personality sketch, as it doesn't mention anything very specific to that field, but the general intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could still apply to some degree.
