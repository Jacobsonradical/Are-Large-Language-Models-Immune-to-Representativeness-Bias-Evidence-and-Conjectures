Based on the personality sketch provided and the interests indicated, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The reasoning for these probabilities:
- The personality sketch shows a strong connection with nature and animals, which aligns closely with agricultural and veterinary sciences, hence the high probability.
- The mention of solving puzzles and a good grasp of abstract concepts suggests some alignment with computer science, though this is less directly related than agricultural and veterinary sciences, resulting in a moderate probability.
- Business administration is less related to direct personal interests in nature or problem-solving as described in the sketch, thus having the lowest probability.
