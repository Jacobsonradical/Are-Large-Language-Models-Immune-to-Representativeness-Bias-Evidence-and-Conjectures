Based on the personality sketch and the clues given about particular interests and skills of the subject, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

These estimates reflect the alignment between the personality traits and interests mentioned in the sketch with typical fields of study. Adam's deep love for animals and genuine curiosity about nature makes agricultural and veterinary science a likely match, despite not being his actual field, hence the higher probability. While his ability to understand abstract concepts aligns well with computer science, his interest isn't directly mentioned in terms of technology, lowering the relevance slightly. Business administration, generally less directly connected to love for nature or animals, receives the lowest estimation.
