Based on the provided personality sketch of the subject and the different academic fields:

1. Business Administration: This field generally draws individuals interested in management, finance, and strategic thinking. While having a warm heart and high intelligence might be advantageous, the specific interests in nature, puzzles, and a deep connection with animals don't align naturally with the typical focus of business administration studies. Therefore, the likelihood that the personality sketch describes someone in business administration (if Adam is enrolled in a different field) is lower.

2. Computer Science: This field involves logical thinking, problem-solving, and often a focus on abstract concepts, which could align with the subject's interest in puzzles and high intelligence. However, the specific emphasis on love for nature and animals is less obviously connected to computer science. Therefore, the match is possible but not exceptionally strong.

3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: This field involves a direct engagement with plants and animals and often attracts those who are naturally curious about nature and passionate about animal welfare. The subject's described characteristics are highly congruent with the typical interests and empathy towards living beings common in students of this field.

The probabilities can be estimated as follows:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
