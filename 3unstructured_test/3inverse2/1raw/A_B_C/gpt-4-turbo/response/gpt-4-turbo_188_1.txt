Based on the personality sketch provided and the fields of study mentioned, here is the estimated probability that the sketch could be about Adam if he were enrolled in each of these fields other than his actual field:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

These values reflect an analysis considering the alignment of the personality traits with typical interests and skills associated with these fields. The higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science reflects a closer match with an interest in nature and animals, while computer science and business administration have lower probabilities due to a less direct correlation with the interests described.
