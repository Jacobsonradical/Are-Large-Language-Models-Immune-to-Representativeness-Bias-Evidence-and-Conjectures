Given the personality sketch and the potential fields of study, here are the estimates of the probability that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in each of these fields:

- **Business Administration**: This field often attracts individuals with an interest in management, economics, and administration. The sketch emphasizes curiosity about nature and animals, empathy, and enjoyment in solving puzzles, which align more tangentially with the typical skills and interests seen in business administration. Consequently, the match here seems less probable.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns closely with the interests and characteristics described in the personality sketch. A focus on nature, plants, and a love for animals is directly relevant to both agriculture and veterinary studies. Given these connections, this field would likely have a much higher probability.

- **Computer Science**: While the enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence mentioned in the sketch are qualities beneficial in computer science, the emphasis on a love for animals and plants is not directly tied to this field. Hence, the link is weaker compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Here are the estimated probabilities:
