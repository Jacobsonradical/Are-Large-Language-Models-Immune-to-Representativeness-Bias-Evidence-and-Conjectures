Based on the personality sketch provided, which highlights a keen interest in nature, plants, puzzles, strong empathy, and love for animals, here are the estimated probabilities that this personality sketch was about Adam for each field:

- **Computer Science**: This field generally focuses on technology, programming, and systems management. While problem-solving skills are highly relevant, the specific interests in nature and animals are less directly aligned with typical computer science studies.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field is strongly aligned with interests in plants, animals, and nature. Students here are likely to have a fascination with living organisms and how to nurture them, which matches the personality traits described.

- **Business Administration**: This field generally covers management, finance, and operations of businesses. While empathy and understanding can be useful in leadership roles within business, direct interests in plants and animals are less relevant to typical business studies.

Considering these points, the estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
``` 

These values reflect the lesser or greater probability of alignment of Adam's interests, as stated in the personality sketch, with the curricula and focus areas of the respective fields.
