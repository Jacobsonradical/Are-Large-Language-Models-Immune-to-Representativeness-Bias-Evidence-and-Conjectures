To estimate the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam in these different fields while assuming he studied in a different field, we need to consider how well the characteristics described in the sketch align with typical interests and aptitudes associated with these fields.

1. **Computer Science**: The sketch notes high intelligence and an aptitude for solving puzzles. These attributes are common in computer science, which often requires problem-solving skills and abstract thinking. However, the strong emphasis on nature, plants, and a deep love for animals is not typically associated with computer science. Thus, the probability that the sketch was about Adam, assuming he did not study computer science, might be moderate.
  
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The interests in nature, plants, and animals align closely with agricultural and veterinary sciences. These fields directly engage with such elements. Since the personality sketch strongly reflects these interests, it increases the likelihood that the sketch could be about someone in this field. Therefore, if Adam did not study in this field, it would decrease the probability that the sketch was about him.
  
3. **Business Administration**: This field typically focuses on management, finance, operations, and other elements that are not directly related to nature, animals, or solving puzzles. The connection between the personality traits described and the typical subjects covered in business administration is relatively weak. Assuming Adam studied business administration, it might be less likely that the personality sketch aligns with his profile in this case.

Based on these considerations, the probabilities are framed as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.5",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
``` 

These figures represent an intuitive estimation considering the typical interests and skills associated with each field and the contents of the personality sketch.
