Given the personality sketch provided, the probabilities that it describes Adam, if he were enrolled in different fields than the ones in question, could be analyzed as follows:

1. **Business Administration**: Generally, this field might not directly tie into a love for nature or animals, nor would it necessarily encompass a lot of work with abstract concepts as described in the sketch. Instead, business administration typically focuses on finance, management, and operations, areas not strongly associated with the traits described.
   - Probability: **0.2**

2. **Computer Science**: While computer science does often require understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, it doesn't necessarily involve a direct relationship with nature or animals. Although a curious, puzzle-solving mind fits well here, the specific interests in nature and empathy towards animals are less aligned.
   - Probability: **0.3**

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field directly correlates with a love and understanding of plants and animals. The subject's described traits align well with interests typical in students of agriculture and veterinary science. While the high intelligence and appreciation of abstract concepts might be less emphasized, they are not incompatible.
   - Probability: **0.8**

Overall assessment:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
