Given the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that this sketch could describe Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a different field than the ones mentioned:

- **Computer Science**: Individuals in computer science generally have strong problem-solving skills and an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts. The traits of strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about plants are not commonly associated directly with the field of computer science but are not exclusive of the possibility. Therefore, the match may not be as direct, but still plausible given the problem-solving connections.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns closely with a love for animals and curiosity about plants. Students and professionals in this area are often deeply connected to nature and may exhibit characteristics like empathy towards living beings, making it a highly likely match.
  
- **Business Administration**: While business administration requires good problem-solving skills and often an understanding of complex concepts, direct connections to nature, plants, and empathy towards animals are less commonly related traits for this field. Emotional intelligence is valued, but the specific interests and personal values described are less typical directly within the scope of business studies.
