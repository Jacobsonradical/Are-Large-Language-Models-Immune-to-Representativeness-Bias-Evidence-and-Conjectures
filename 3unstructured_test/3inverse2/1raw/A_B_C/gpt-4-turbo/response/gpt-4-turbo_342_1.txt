Based on the personality sketch provided, and assuming Adam was enrolled in fields different from those listed, here are the estimates of the probability that the sketch was about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

These estimates reflect the likelihood that someone with Adam's described interests and aptitudes might be studying in each field. Agricultural and veterinary science is rated higher due to the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals. Computer science, although it involves solving puzzles, is less congruent with a love for nature and animals. Business administration is rated lowest because the personality traits described do not typically align closely with this field.
