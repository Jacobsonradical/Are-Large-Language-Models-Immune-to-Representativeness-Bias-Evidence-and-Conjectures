Given the personality sketch and Adam's academic status, here's an estimation of the probability that the sketch fits Adam if he were studying in fields different than the ones mentioned:

- Business administration (Typically focuses on skills pertinent to managing and running businesses. The noted empathy and appreciation for dedication could relate to leadership, yet there is weak alignment with his interests in nature and puzzles.): 
- Computer science (Involves substantial puzzle-solving and abstract concept understanding, making it moderately compatible with attributes like high intelligence and problem-solving interests. There's a lesser, though plausible, connection to nature and empathy towards animals.):
- Agricultural and veterinary science (Directly aligns with love for animals, interest in nature and plants. Empathy, hard work appreciation, and intelligence would be highly relevant and beneficial in this field.):
