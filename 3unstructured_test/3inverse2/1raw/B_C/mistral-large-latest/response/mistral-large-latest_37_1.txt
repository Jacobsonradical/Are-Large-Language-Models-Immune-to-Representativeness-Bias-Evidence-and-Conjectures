{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as their high intelligence, could apply to both fields, but are not particularly indicative of business administration specifically. Hence, a lower probability of 0.3 is assigned.
- The subject's aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles aligns more closely with the problem-solving and logical thinking required in computer science. Therefore, a higher probability of 0.6 is assigned.
