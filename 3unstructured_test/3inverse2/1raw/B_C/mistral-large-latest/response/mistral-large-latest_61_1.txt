{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a personality more aligned with fields related to life sciences or environmental studies rather than business administration. However, there's still a possibility that Adam could be interested in business administration for other reasons, hence a probability of 0.3.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the problem-solving and analytical skills required in computer science. Therefore, a higher probability of 0.6 is assigned to computer science.
