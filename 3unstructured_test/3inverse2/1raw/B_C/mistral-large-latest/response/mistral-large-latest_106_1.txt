Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as their high intelligence, could apply to both fields, but are more commonly associated with business administration, hence a probability of 0.3.
- The subject's genuine curiosity, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts align more closely with the problem-solving and analytical skills required in computer science, hence a higher probability of 0.6.
- The subject's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as their strong empathy, are not typically associated with either business administration or computer science, which is why neither field has a very high probability.
