Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest interests that are not typically aligned with business administration, hence the lower probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could align with computer science, hence the higher probability. However, the strong appreciation for nature and animals might suggest a better fit in fields like biology or environmental science, which is why the probability is not higher.
