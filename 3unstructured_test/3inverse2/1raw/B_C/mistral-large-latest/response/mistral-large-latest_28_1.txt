{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a personality that might be less commonly associated with business administration, hence the lower probability of 0.3.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align more closely with the problem-solving and analytical skills required in computer science, hence the higher probability of 0.6.
