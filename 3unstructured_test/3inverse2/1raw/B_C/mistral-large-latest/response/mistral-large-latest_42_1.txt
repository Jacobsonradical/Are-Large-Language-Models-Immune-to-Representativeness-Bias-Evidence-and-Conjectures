  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as their high intelligence, could make them a good fit for business administration. However, the personality sketch's focus on nature, plants, animals, and puzzle-solving doesn't strongly correlate with the typical business administration student's interests, hence a lower probability of 0.3.
- The subject's high intelligence, curiosity, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align more closely with the computer science field. Additionally, their puzzle-solving skills could translate well to programming and problem-solving in computer science, leading to a higher probability of 0.5. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals in the personality sketch keeps the probability from being higher.
