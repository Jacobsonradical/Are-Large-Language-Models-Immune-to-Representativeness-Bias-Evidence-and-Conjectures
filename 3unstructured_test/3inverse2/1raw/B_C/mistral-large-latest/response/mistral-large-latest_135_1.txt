{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as their high intelligence, could apply to both fields, but are not particularly indicative of business administration specifically. Hence, a lower probability of 0.3 is assigned.
- The subject's aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles leans more towards computer science. Hence, a higher probability of 0.5 is assigned. However, it's not a very high probability because the personality sketch also emphasizes love for nature, plants, and animals, which are not typically associated with computer science.
