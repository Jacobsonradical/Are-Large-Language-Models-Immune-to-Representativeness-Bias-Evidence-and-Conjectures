Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as their high intelligence, could apply to both fields, but are not specifically indicative of business administration. Hence, a lower probability is assigned to business administration.
- The subject's genuine curiosity, enjoyment in solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts align more closely with the problem-solving and analytical skills required in computer science, hence a higher probability is assigned to computer science.
