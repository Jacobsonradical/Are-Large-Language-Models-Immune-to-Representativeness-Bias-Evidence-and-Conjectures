  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a personality more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine rather than business administration. However, there's still a possibility that Adam could be interested in business, hence a probability of 0.3.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest a stronger alignment with computer science. Therefore, a higher probability of 0.6 is assigned to this field.
