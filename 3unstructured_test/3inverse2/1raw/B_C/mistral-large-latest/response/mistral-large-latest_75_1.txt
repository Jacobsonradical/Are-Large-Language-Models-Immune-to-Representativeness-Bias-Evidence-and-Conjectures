Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a leaning towards fields that might involve environmental or biological sciences, rather than business administration. However, their understanding of hard work and dedication could apply to any field, hence a probability of 0.3 for business administration.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the problem-solving and analytical skills required in computer science, hence a higher probability of 0.6 for computer science.
