Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation:
- "Computer science": The sketch mentions that the subject has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are qualities that align well with the field of computer science. Hence, a probability of 0.6 is assigned.
- "Business administration": While the subject's empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be useful in business administration, the sketch does not highlight leadership, management, or entrepreneurial skills, which are typically associated with this field. Therefore, a lower probability of 0.2 is assigned.
