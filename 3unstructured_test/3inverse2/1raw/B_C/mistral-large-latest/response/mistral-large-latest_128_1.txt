Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- "Computer science": The sketch mentions that the subject is good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, which are skills that are highly relevant to computer science. Hence, a higher probability is assigned.
- "Business administration": While the subject's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be beneficial in business administration, the focus on nature, plants, and animals, as well as the mention of puzzles and abstract concepts, do not strongly correlate with this field. Thus, a lower probability is assigned.
