Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation:
- "Computer Science": The sketch mentions that the subject is good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, which are qualities that align well with the field of computer science. Hence, a higher probability is assigned.
- "Business Administration": While the subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to business administration, the other traits mentioned, such as a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, do not strongly correlate with this field. Therefore, a lower probability is assigned.
