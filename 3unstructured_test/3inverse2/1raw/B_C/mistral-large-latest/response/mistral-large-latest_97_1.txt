  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- Computer Science: The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills align well with the field of computer science. Hence, a probability of 0.6 is assigned.
- Business Administration: While the subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to business administration, the other traits mentioned do not strongly correlate with this field. Therefore, a lower probability of 0.3 is assigned.
