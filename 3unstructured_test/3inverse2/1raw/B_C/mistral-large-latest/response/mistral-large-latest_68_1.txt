Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- The sketch mentions high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving, which are traits that align well with the field of computer science.
- The mention of empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could relate to various fields, but they are not as strongly indicative of business administration, hence the lower probability.
