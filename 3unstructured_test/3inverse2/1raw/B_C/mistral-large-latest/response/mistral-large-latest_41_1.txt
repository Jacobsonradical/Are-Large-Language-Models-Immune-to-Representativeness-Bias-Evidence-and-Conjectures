Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- "Computer science": The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills and interests common in computer science. Hence, a probability of 0.6 is assigned.
- "Business administration": While the subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable, the other traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of puzzles do not strongly correlate with business administration. Thus, a lower probability of 0.3 is assigned.
