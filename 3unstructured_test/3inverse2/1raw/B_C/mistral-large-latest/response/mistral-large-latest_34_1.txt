Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The sketch mentions traits like empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence, which could be relevant in business. However, the focus on nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts makes it less likely that Adam would be in business administration. Hence, a probability of 0.3.
- **Computer Science**: The mention of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with skills needed in computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals suggests that while possible, it's not the most likely field. Hence, a probability of 0.5.
