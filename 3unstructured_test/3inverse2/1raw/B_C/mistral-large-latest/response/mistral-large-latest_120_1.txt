Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy seem more aligned with fields other than business administration, hence the lower probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could indicate a good fit for computer science, hence the higher probability. However, the sketch also mentions a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could apply to any field, and a love for nature and animals, which might suggest a better fit for a field in science or environmental studies.
