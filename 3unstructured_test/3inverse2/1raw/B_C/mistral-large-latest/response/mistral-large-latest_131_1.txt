Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a leaning towards fields that involve environmental or biological sciences, rather than business administration.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align more closely with computer science.
- Therefore, if Adam was enrolled in a different field, it is more likely that the sketch describes someone in computer science than in business administration.
