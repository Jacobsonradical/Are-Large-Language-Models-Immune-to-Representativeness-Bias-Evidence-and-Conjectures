  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as their high intelligence, could make them a good fit for business administration. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of puzzles doesn't strongly correlate with the typical business administration student, hence a lower probability of 0.3.
- The subject's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts align more closely with the field of computer science. However, their strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are not typically emphasized in this field, so the probability is still not extremely high, estimated at 0.5.
