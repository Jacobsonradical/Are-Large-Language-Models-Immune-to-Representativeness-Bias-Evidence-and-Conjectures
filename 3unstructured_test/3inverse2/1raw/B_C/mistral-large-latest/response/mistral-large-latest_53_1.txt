Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- The sketch mentions high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving, which are traits that align well with the field of computer science.
- The traits of empathy, warmth, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be found in any field, but they are not as strongly indicative of business administration as they are of other fields like social work, education, or healthcare. Therefore, the probability for business administration is lower.
