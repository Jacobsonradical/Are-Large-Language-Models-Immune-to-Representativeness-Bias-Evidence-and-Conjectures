  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as their high intelligence, could make them a good fit for business administration. However, the personality sketch's focus on nature, animals, and puzzles (which could imply a problem-solving mind) doesn't strongly indicate a business-oriented mindset, hence a probability of 0.3.
- The subject's high intelligence, curiosity, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align well with the problem-solving and analytical skills required in computer science. The mention of puzzle-solving also leans more towards this field, hence a probability of 0.5.
