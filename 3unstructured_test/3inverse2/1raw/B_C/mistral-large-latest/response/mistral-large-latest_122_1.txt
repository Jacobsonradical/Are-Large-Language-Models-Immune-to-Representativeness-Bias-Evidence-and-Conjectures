Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as their high intelligence, could apply to both fields, but these traits are quite general.
- The genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles lean more towards fields that involve problem-solving and potentially scientific or environmental studies, which are more aligned with computer science (especially in areas like data analysis, environmental modeling, or bioinformatics) than business administration.
- The emphasis on empathy and a warm heart might suggest a leaning away from purely business-oriented fields, which often prioritize different skill sets.
