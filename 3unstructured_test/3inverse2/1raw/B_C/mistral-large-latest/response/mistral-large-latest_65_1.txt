Explanation:
- The subject's interests and qualities seem more aligned with fields that involve problem-solving, empathy, and a love for nature and animals, rather than business administration. Hence, the lower probability for business administration.
- Computer science often involves solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which the subject enjoys. However, it doesn't typically involve a deep love for animals or nature, hence the moderate probability for computer science.
