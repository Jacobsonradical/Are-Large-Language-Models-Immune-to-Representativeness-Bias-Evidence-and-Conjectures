Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation:
- "Computer Science": The sketch mentions that the subject is good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, which are skills that are highly relevant to computer science. Hence, a higher probability is assigned.
- "Business Administration": While the subject's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be applicable, the focus on nature, plants, and animals, as well as the mention of abstract concepts and puzzles, does not strongly align with business administration. Hence, a lower probability is assigned.
