Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation:
- "Computer Science": The sketch mentions that the subject has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and is good at understanding abstract concepts, all of which are qualities that could be associated with someone in computer science. Hence, a probability of 0.6 is assigned.
- "Business Administration": While the subject's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be beneficial in business administration, the sketch does not highlight typical business-oriented traits such as leadership, extroversion, or a focus on management or finance. Thus, a lower probability of 0.2 is assigned.
