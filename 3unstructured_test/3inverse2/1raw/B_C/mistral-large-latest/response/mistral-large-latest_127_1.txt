Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation:
- The sketch mentions traits like high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving, which are common among computer science students, hence the higher probability.
- The traits mentioned are less commonly associated with business administration, hence the lower probability. However, it's still possible that Adam could have these interests alongside a business administration degree, so the probability is not zero.
