{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy seem less aligned with typical interests in business administration, hence the lower probability of 0.2.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could be more in line with computer science, hence the higher probability of 0.4. However, the strong empathy and love for nature and animals might suggest a better fit in fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine, which is why the probability for computer science is not higher.
