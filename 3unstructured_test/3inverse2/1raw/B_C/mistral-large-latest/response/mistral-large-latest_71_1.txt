Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The sketch mentions traits like empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence, which could be applicable to business administration, but the focus on nature, plants, puzzles, and abstract concepts makes it less likely. Hence, a probability of 0.3.
- **Computer Science**: The mention of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with skills needed in computer science. Additionally, high intelligence is a common trait among computer science students. Therefore, a higher probability of 0.5 is assigned.
