Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to any field, including business administration, but the other traits seem less aligned with this field, hence the lower probability of 0.3.
- The subject's high intelligence, curiosity, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align more closely with computer science, leading to a higher probability of 0.6. Additionally, the mention of solving puzzles could be seen as analogous to problem-solving in computer science.
