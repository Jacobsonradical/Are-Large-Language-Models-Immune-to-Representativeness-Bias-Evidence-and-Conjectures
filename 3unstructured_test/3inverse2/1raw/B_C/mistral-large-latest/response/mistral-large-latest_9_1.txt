Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy seem to align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. However, their high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also translate well to other fields.
- "Computer science" has a higher probability because it involves solving puzzles (algorithms, debugging) and understanding abstract concepts (theoretical computer science).
- "Business administration" has a lower probability because while it requires high intelligence and understanding of hard work, it does not directly align with the subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, or empathy.
