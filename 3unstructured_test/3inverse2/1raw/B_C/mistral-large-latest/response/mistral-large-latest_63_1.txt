Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as their high intelligence, could indicate a good fit for business administration. However, the sketch doesn't highlight leadership, management, or entrepreneurial skills, which are key in this field, hence the lower probability of 0.3.
- The subject's genuine curiosity, high intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align well with the problem-solving and analytical nature of computer science, leading to a higher probability of 0.6. Additionally, the mention of puzzle-solving further supports this estimate.
