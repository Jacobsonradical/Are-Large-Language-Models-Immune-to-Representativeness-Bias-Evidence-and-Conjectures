```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a leaning towards fields related to life sciences or environmental studies rather than business administration.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align more closely with fields like computer science.
- Therefore, the probability is higher for computer science compared to business administration.
