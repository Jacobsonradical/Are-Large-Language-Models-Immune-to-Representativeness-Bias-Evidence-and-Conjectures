{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills align well with the computer science field, hence a probability of 0.6.
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to business administration, but the other traits mentioned are less typical of this field, resulting in a lower probability of 0.3.
