Explanation:
- The subject's interests and qualities seem more aligned with fields that involve problem-solving, empathy, and a love for nature and animals. Business administration, while it requires hard work and dedication, doesn't typically align with these interests as closely.
- Computer science involves solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which the subject enjoys. However, it doesn't necessarily involve nature, plants, or animals directly, hence the probability is not extremely high.
