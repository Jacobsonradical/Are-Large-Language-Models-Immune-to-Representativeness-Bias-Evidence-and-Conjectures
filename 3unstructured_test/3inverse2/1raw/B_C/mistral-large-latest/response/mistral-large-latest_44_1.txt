{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation:
- The subject's interests and personality traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication do not strongly correlate with the field of business administration, hence the lower probability of 0.2.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could indicate a stronger alignment with computer science, hence the higher probability of 0.4. However, the sketch also mentions interests that are not typically associated with computer science, such as a deep love for animals and a curiosity about nature, which is why the probability is not higher.
