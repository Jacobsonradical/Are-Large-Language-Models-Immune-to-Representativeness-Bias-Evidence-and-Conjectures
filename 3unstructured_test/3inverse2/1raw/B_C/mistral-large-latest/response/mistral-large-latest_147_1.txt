Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest interests that are not typically aligned with business administration, hence the lower probability of 0.3.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align more closely with computer science, hence the higher probability of 0.6.
