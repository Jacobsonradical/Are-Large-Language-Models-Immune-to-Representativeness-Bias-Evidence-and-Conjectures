Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a personality that might be more drawn to fields related to life sciences, environmental studies, or social sciences rather than business administration. However, there's still a possibility that Adam could be interested in business administration for other reasons, hence a probability of 0.3.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills required for computer science. Therefore, the probability is higher at 0.6.
