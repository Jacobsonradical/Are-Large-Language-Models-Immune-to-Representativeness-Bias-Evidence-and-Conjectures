{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as their high intelligence, could apply to both fields, but are not particularly indicative of business administration specifically. Hence, a lower probability of 0.3 is assigned.
- The subject's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align more closely with the problem-solving and analytical skills required in computer science, resulting in a higher probability of 0.6.
