{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation:
- The subject's interests and qualities seem more aligned with fields that involve problem-solving, empathy, and a love for nature and animals. Business administration, while it requires hard work and understanding of abstract concepts, does not closely align with these personal traits, hence a lower probability of 0.2.
- Computer science involves puzzle-solving and understanding abstract concepts, which the subject is good at. However, it does not directly involve nature, plants, or animals, which are the subject's primary interests. Thus, a probability of 0.4 is estimated.
