Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's strong empathy, appreciation for hard work, and understanding of abstract concepts could be found in business administration, but these traits are not uniquely indicative of this field, hence a lower probability of 0.3.
- The subject's high intelligence, curiosity, and puzzle-solving skills align more closely with computer science, leading to a higher probability of 0.6. However, the deep love for animals and nature is not typically associated with this field, which is why the probability is not higher.
