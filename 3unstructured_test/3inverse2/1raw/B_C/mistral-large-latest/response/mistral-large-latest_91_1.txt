{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as their high intelligence, could apply to both fields, but are not particularly indicative of business administration specifically. Hence, a lower probability of 0.3 is assigned.
- The subject's genuine curiosity, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align more closely with the problem-solving and innovative nature of computer science. Thus, a higher probability of 0.6 is assigned.
