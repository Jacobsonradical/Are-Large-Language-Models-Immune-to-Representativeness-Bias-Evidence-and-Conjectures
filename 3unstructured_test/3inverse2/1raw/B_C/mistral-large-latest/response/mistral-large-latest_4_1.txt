Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- The sketch mentions traits like high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving, which are often associated with fields like computer science, hence the higher probability.
- The traits mentioned seem less typically associated with business administration, but it's still possible, hence a lower but non-zero probability.
