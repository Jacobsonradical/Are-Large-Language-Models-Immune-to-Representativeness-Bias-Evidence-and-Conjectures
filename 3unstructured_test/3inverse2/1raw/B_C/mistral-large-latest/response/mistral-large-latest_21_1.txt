Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.3)**: The subject's interests in nature, animals, and puzzles, along with their strong empathy and appreciation for hard work, do not strongly align with typical traits associated with business administration. While high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts can be beneficial in business, the other traits suggest a lower probability.

- **Computer Science (0.5)**: The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, particularly in understanding abstract concepts, align well with skills needed in computer science. However, the strong focus on nature, animals, and empathy might suggest a slightly lower probability compared to a field more directly related to these interests.
