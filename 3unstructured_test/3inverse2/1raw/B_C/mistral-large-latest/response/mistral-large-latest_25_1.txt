Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation:
- Computer Science: The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills and interests common in computer science. Hence, a probability of 0.6 is assigned.
- Business Administration: While the subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable, the other traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles do not strongly correlate with business administration. Hence, a lower probability of 0.2 is assigned.
