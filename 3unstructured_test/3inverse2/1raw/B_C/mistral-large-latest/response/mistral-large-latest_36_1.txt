Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation:
- The sketch mentions traits like high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving, which are often associated with computer science, hence the higher probability.
- The traits mentioned are less typically associated with business administration, hence the lower probability. However, it's still possible that Adam could be interested in business administration, so the probability is not zero.
