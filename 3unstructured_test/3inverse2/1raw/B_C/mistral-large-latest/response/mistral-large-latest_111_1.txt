Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- "Computer Science": The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills and interests common in computer science. Hence, a higher probability is assigned.
- "Business Administration": While the subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business administration, the other traits mentioned, such as a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and quiet demeanor, are less typically associated with this field. Therefore, a lower probability is assigned.
