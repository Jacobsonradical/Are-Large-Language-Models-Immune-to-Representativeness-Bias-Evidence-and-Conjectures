Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy seem to align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. However, their high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could translate well into other fields.
- "Computer science" has a higher probability because it requires strong problem-solving skills (as indicated by the subject's enjoyment of puzzles) and the ability to understand abstract concepts.
- "Business administration" has a lower probability because it typically does not involve much interaction with nature or animals, and it may not fully utilize the subject's strengths in understanding abstract concepts or their strong empathy.
