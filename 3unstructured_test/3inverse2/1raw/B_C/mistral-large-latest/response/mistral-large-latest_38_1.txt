Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The sketch mentions traits like empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence, which could be applicable to business administration. However, the focus on nature, plants, puzzles, and abstract concepts suggests a stronger inclination towards scientific or analytical fields. Hence, a lower probability of 0.3 is assigned.
- **Computer Science**: The mention of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with the skills and interests often found in computer science. Therefore, a higher probability of 0.5 is assigned.
