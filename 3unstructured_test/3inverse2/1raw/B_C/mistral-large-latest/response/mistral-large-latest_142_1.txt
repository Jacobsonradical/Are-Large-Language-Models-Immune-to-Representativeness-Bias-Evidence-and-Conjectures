Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation:
- "Computer Science": The sketch mentions that the subject has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits are strongly correlated with skills required in computer science, hence a probability of 0.6.
- "Business Administration": While the subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to business administration, the other traits mentioned (such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy) are not as strongly correlated with this field, hence a lower probability of 0.2.
