{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation:
- The subject's interests in nature, animals, and puzzles, as well as their strong empathy and appreciation for hard work, do not strongly correlate with the field of business administration, hence the lower probability of 0.2.
- The subject's high intelligence, curiosity, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts suggest they might have an aptitude for computer science, hence the higher probability of 0.4. However, the personality sketch does not mention any direct interest in technology or programming, which is why the probability is not higher.
