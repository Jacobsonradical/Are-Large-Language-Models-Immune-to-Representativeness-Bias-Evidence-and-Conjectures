Explanation:
- The subject's interests and qualities seem more aligned with fields that involve problem-solving, empathy, and a love for nature and animals. Business administration, while it requires intelligence and understanding of hard work, doesn't typically align with the other traits mentioned.
- Computer science involves solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which the subject enjoys. However, it doesn't typically involve a deep love for animals or nature, hence the probability is not extremely high.
