}

Explanation:
- "Computer science": The sketch mentions that the subject has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and is good at understanding abstract concepts, all of which are qualities that are often associated with computer science. Hence, a higher probability is assigned.
- "Business administration": While the subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to business administration, the other traits mentioned, such as the curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of puzzles, are not as strongly associated with this field. Hence, a lower probability is assigned.
