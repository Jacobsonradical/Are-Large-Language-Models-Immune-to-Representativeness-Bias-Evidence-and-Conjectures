Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation:
- "Computer science": The sketch mentions that the subject has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are traits that align well with the field of computer science. Hence, a probability of 0.6 is assigned.
- "Business administration": While the subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to business administration, the other traits mentioned, such as a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of puzzles, do not strongly correlate with this field. Therefore, a lower probability of 0.2 is assigned.
