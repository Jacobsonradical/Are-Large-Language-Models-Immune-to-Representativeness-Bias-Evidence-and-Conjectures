  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as their high intelligence, could make them a good fit for business administration. However, the personality sketch's focus on nature, plants, animals, and puzzles (which could imply a problem-solving mindset) doesn't strongly correlate with the typical business administration student. Hence, a probability of 0.3 is assigned.
- The subject's high intelligence, curiosity, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could make them a good fit for computer science. Additionally, their enjoyment of solving puzzles suggests a problem-solving mindset that is valuable in computer science. However, the strong focus on nature and animals in the personality sketch is not typically associated with computer science. Hence, a probability of 0.5 is assigned.
