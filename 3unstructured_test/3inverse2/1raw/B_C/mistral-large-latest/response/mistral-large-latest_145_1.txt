Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The sketch mentions traits like empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence, which could be applicable to business administration, but the focus on nature, plants, and animals makes it less likely. Hence, a probability of 0.3.
- **Computer Science**: The mention of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with skills needed in computer science. However, the strong focus on nature and animals suggests it might not be the most likely field, but still more likely than business administration. Hence, a probability of 0.5.
