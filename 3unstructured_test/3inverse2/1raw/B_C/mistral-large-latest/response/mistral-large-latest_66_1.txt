Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a leaning towards fields related to life sciences or environmental studies. However, their aptitude for abstract concepts and puzzle-solving could also indicate a potential fit for computer science.
- The subject's appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to any field, but it does not specifically point towards business administration.
- Therefore, if Adam was not studying computer science, there is a moderate chance (0.6) that the sketch describes him, given his analytical and problem-solving skills. If he was not studying business administration, there is a lower chance (0.3) that the sketch describes him, as the personality traits mentioned do not strongly correlate with this field.
