Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy seem to align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. However, these options were not provided.
- The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well in computer science, hence the higher probability.
- Business administration seems less likely, given the subject's interests and qualities, but it's still possible, hence a lower but non-zero probability.
