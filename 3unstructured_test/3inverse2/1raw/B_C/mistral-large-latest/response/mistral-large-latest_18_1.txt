Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: The subject's traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy do not typically align with the stereotypical traits of business administration students. However, high intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication could be relevant, hence a low but non-zero probability.
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are traits that could be more commonly found in computer science students. However, the strong focus on nature, plants, and animals slightly reduces the probability.
