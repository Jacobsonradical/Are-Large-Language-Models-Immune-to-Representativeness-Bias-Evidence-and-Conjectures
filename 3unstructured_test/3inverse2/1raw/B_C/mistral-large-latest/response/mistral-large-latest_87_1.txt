Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- The sketch mentions high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving, which are traits that align well with the field of computer science.
- The mention of empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to any field, but these traits are not as strongly associated with business administration as they are with other fields. Therefore, the probability for business administration is lower.
