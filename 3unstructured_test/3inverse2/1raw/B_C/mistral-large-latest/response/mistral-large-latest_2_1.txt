Explanation:
- The subject's strong analytical skills ("good at understanding abstract concepts") and interest in problem-solving ("enjoys solving puzzles") suggest a higher probability of being in computer science.
- The subject's personality traits do not strongly align with business administration, hence the lower probability. However, it is still possible due to the subject's appreciation for hard work and dedication, which are valuable traits in any field.
