{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a personality more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine rather than business administration. However, there's still a small probability (0.2) that Adam could be studying business administration, as it's not entirely outside the realm of possibility.
- The subject's high intelligence, aptitude for abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could indicate a good fit for computer science. Therefore, the probability (0.4) is higher than that of business administration, but it's still not the most likely field based on the personality sketch.
