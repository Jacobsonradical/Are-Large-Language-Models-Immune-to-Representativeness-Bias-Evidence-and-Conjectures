Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The sketch emphasizes curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, which are not typically the primary focuses in business administration. Therefore, the probability is lower at 0.2.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align more closely with skills valued in computer science. Thus, the probability is higher at 0.4.
