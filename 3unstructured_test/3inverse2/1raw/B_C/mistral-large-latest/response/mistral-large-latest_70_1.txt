Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- "Computer Science": The sketch mentions that the subject is good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, which are skills that align well with computer science. Hence, a higher probability is assigned.
- "Business Administration": While the subject's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be beneficial in business administration, the sketch's focus on curiosity about nature, love for animals, and puzzle-solving does not strongly correlate with this field. Hence, a lower probability is assigned.
