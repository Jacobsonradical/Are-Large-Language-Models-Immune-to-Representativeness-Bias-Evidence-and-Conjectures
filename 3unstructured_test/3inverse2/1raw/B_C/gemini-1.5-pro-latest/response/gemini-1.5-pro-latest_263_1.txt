Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the description emphasizes a love for nature and animals, which might be less typical drivers for choosing a business path. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Individual Variation:**  These are just probabilities, not guarantees. There are plenty of nature-loving business students and puzzle-solving individuals in all fields.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch doesn't provide information about Adam's career goals, financial interests, or other factors that might influence his field of study.
