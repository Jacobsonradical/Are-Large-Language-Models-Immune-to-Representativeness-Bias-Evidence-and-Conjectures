Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat with a computer science student (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking). However, the emphasis on nature and empathy is less stereotypical, making the probability moderate. 
* **Business Administration:**  The personality description doesn't strongly suggest a typical business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valued, the focus on nature, animals, and empathy is less common. Hence, a higher probability than computer science.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that personality sketches are very limited. People in any field can have diverse interests and traits. These probabilities are simply educated guesses based on general perceptions.
