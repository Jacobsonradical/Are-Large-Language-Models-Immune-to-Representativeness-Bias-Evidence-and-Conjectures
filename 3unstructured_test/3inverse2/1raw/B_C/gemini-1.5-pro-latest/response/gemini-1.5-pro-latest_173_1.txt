Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. However, the strong connection to nature and animals isn't as stereotypical. Hence, a moderate probability of 0.4.
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the profile lacks strong indicators of typical business interests (e.g., leadership, finance, marketing). The empathy and nature focus further decrease the likelihood. Thus, a lower probability of 0.2. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of a person's field of study. Many individuals in computer science are deeply connected to nature, and many in business administration are empathetic and animal lovers.
