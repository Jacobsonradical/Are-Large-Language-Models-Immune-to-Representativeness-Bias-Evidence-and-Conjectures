Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose guidelines based on stereotypes and the provided description could fit individuals in many fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in business professionals, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for someone in a more science-oriented or analytical field. That's why the probability is lower. 
* **Computer Science:** The description highlights problem-solving skills ("enjoys solving puzzles"), high intelligence, and an understanding of abstract concepts â€“ all of which are strongly associated with computer science. This connection makes the probability higher.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that personality sketches are incredibly limited in determining someone's field of study.  Many individuals in business administration could possess the traits described, and many computer science students might not. These probabilities are simply based on general perceptions and not on any definitive data.
