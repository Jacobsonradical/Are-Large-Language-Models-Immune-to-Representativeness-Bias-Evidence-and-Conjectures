Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and some very general stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The sketch highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and understanding abstract concepts, all of which are traditionally associated with computer science.  However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less common in the field (though not unheard of!).
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence is certainly valuable in business, the personality traits described (empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work) don't align as strongly with the stereotypical image of someone pursuing business administration.  

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and generalizations.  Individual personalities within any field vary greatly.
