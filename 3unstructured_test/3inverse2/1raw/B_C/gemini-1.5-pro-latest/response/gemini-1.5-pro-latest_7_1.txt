Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in business students, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with common perceptions of computer science students. The "quiet boy" trope also plays into this.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities rely on common stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field are diverse.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch is brief. More details about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would drastically change these probabilities.
