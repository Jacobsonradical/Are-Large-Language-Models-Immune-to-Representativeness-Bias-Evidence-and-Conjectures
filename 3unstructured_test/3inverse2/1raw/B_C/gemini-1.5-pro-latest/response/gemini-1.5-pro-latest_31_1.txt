Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch relates to the fields and my probability estimations:

**Analysis:**

* **Computer Science:**  The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) are strong indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. These traits are not as strongly associated with a typical business administration student, though they certainly don't exclude it.

**Probability Estimates:**

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on stereotypes and the limited information provided. There are plenty of individuals in both fields who defy these common perceptions. The sketch alone is not enough to definitively determine Adam's field of study.
