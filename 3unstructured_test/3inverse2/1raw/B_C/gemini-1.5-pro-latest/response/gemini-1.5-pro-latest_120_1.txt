Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the personality sketch could apply to individuals in many fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch mentions enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are often associated with computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical in this field.
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality description doesn't strongly align with typical stereotypes of the field (which often emphasize ambition, competitiveness, and leadership). The love for nature and animals might be seen as less common interests in this domain.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly subjective. It's crucial to remember that people are diverse, and personality traits don't exclusively belong to specific fields. There are undoubtedly individuals passionate about nature and animals in both computer science and business administration.
