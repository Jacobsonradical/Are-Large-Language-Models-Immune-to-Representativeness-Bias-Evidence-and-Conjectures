Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative and based on stereotypes associated with the fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, understanding hard work, and a warm heart. While these traits are valuable in business, they are not as stereotypically associated with business administration compared to fields like social work or counseling. 
* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. These traits are strongly aligned with stereotypes of individuals drawn to computer science.  

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are based on very limited information and rely on generalizations. 
* Many individuals in business administration possess the traits described, and many in computer science may not. 
* It's crucial to avoid using such sketches for making real-world judgments about individuals or their career choices.
