Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and a very limited sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch mentions enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, all of which align with stereotypes of computer science students. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals might be seen as less common in that field.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence is certainly valuable in business, the personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a drive for the competitive or financially-focused aspects often associated with business administration. The emphasis on empathy and appreciation for hard work could be applicable, but don't strongly point towards this field. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and don't reflect the actual diversity within these fields.  Many individuals in computer science are deeply connected to nature, and many business professionals are driven by empathy.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch is very brief. More details about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would drastically change the probability estimates.
