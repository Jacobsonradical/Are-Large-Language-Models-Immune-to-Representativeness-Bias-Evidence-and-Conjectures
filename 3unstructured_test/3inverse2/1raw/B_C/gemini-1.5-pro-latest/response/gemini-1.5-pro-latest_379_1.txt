Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The personality sketch aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  The problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, and appreciation for hard work are common traits. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals might be slightly less common in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** This personality sketch is less typical of a business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the focus on nature, empathy, and a quiet demeanor are less stereotypical.

**Important Note:**  These are just rough estimates based on common perceptions.  People in all fields have diverse personalities, and it's impossible to accurately predict someone's field of study solely based on these traits.
