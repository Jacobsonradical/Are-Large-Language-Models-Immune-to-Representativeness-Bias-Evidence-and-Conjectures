Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The description leans towards interests more commonly associated with science or humanities. While someone in business can certainly be empathetic and nature-loving, these traits aren't as strong predictors. 
* **Computer Science:**  The emphasis on problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence aligns well with the field of computer science. This makes it more likely, but not certain, that Adam could be in this field.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities rely on general perceptions of these fields. Many individuals in business administration may possess the described traits, and not everyone in computer science does.
* **Individuality:**  Personality is complex, and this sketch is limited. There's not enough information to definitively place Adam in any field.
