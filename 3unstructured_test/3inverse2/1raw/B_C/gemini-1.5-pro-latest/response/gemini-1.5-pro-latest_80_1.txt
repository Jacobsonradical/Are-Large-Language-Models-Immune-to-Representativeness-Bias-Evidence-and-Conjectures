Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical skills ("solving puzzles", "understanding abstract concepts"), a common trait among computer science students.  His love for nature doesn't exclude this possibility.
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with business aspirations, such as a drive for leadership, strong communication skills, or interest in finance/markets.

**Important Note:** These are very rough estimations.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic majors.  Many individuals with these traits could be found in any field.
