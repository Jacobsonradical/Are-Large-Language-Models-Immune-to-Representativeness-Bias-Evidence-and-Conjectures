Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are just educated guesses based on stereotypes and the provided description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ all traits often associated with computer science students. However, the strong emphasis on nature, empathy, and love for animals might be seen as less common in this field. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence is important in business, the personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a drive for the competitive or financially-focused aspects often associated with business administration. The emphasis on empathy and appreciation for hard work could be applicable, but doesn't strongly point towards this field.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities are based on general perceptions of these fields.  Individual personalities within any field vary greatly.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a limited snapshot of Adam's personality. Other interests or experiences could significantly influence his field of study.
