Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based purely on a personality sketch and some very general statistics about graduate students:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The sketch leans slightly towards a "computer science" type personality.**  The traits "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "good at understanding abstract concepts" are often associated with individuals drawn to fields like computer science. 
* **However, the sketch doesn't exclude business administration.** The qualities "warm heart", "strong empathy", and appreciation for "hard work and dedication" could apply to someone interested in the human and strategic elements of business. 
* **Graduate student demographics matter.**  While not provided, the overall proportion of graduate students in computer science versus business administration in the U.S. would influence the baseline probability. It's reasonable to assume, without more specific data, that computer science might have a slightly larger proportion.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study.  Many other factors, such as personal experiences, career goals, and financial considerations, play a significant role in a person's choice of academic pursuit.
