Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Puzzles relate to problem-solving, and abstract thinking is crucial in programming. However, the emphasis on nature and animals is less typical.
* **Business Administration:** This profile is less likely to fit a typical business administration student. The sketch emphasizes empathy and love for animals, which are not traits strongly associated with the field's common perception.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions of these fields.  Many individuals in computer science and business administration have diverse interests and personalities.
* **Individual Variation:**  Adam's specific program and interests within each field would drastically change these probabilities. 
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a limited snapshot of Adam's personality.
