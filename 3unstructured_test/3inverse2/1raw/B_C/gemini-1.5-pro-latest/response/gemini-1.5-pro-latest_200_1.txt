Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The sketch mentions enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are strongly correlated with computer science.  However, the emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less common in the field.  Therefore, the probability is moderate.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality description leans more towards interests and traits less directly applicable to a typical business administration program. Thus, the probability is higher than computer science. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes. It's crucial to avoid making assumptions about individuals based solely on their field of study.
