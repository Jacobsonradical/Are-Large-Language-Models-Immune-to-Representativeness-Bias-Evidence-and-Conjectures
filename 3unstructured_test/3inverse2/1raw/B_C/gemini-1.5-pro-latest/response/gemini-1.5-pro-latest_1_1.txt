Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles", "understanding abstract concepts"), which are strongly associated with computer science. The love for nature and animals, while not exclusive to CS, doesn't contradict it either. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the description lacks a strong indication of traits often associated with business students, such as ambition, leadership, or interest in finance/markets. The emphasis on nature and quiet contemplation might be seen as less typical in a business context.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Many individuals in business administration could have the traits described, and many computer science students might not.  It's crucial to avoid overgeneralizing based on personality sketches and field of study.
