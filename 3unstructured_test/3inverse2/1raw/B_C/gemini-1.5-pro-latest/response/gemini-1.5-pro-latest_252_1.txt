```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving, all traits often associated with computer science students. Thus, the probability is moderate.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence is valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work which are not as stereotypical for business students compared to other fields.  Therefore, the probability is lower. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just estimates based on limited information and common stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field can vary greatly. 
* The provided probabilities are subjective and could change with additional information about Adam or the specific programs at his university.
