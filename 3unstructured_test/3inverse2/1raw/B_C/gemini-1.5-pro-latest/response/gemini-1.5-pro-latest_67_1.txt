Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on very limited information and broad stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch doesn't strongly point towards business administration. While intelligence, empathy, and understanding hard work are valuable in business, they aren't exclusive to it. The emphasis on nature, animals, and potentially abstract concepts (which could lean towards scientific thought) makes business administration seem less likely. 

* **Computer Science:** The sketch aligns better with a computer science student.  Puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and a certain level of quiet focus are often associated with the field.  While not definitive, the description makes computer science seem more probable than business administration. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to understand that personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. Many individuals in business administration could have the described traits, and many computer science students might not. This exercise is purely speculative.
