Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the given personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and potentially a quiet disposition. These traits are often associated with individuals drawn to computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** While someone interested in nature and animals could end up in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits typically associated with business administration (e.g., leadership, strong communication, focus on financial success).

**Important Notes:**

* These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Personality sketches can be misleading, and many individuals in business administration could share the described traits.
* The probabilities are subjective and based on general stereotypes.  There's a great deal of individual variation within any field of study.
