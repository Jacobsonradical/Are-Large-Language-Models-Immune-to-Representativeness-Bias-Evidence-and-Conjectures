Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes abstract thinking, problem-solving, and a love for puzzles â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of a business inclination (e.g., interest in finance, leadership, market trends).

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions of these fields.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and nature-loving, and many computer scientists might not fit the "quiet puzzle solver" mold.
* **Individuality:**  People are diverse! Adam's specific interests within each field could significantly influence the actual probability.  

Let me know if you'd like to explore other fields or aspects of the personality sketch!
