Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description highlights traits often associated with computer scientists (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, appreciation for systems). However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality sketch emphasizes qualities not always stereotypically associated with the field (love for animals, quiet nature). 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic fields.
* Many individuals in computer science and business administration possess the traits described. These probabilities reflect broad generalizations.
* Adam's specific interests within each field could drastically change these probabilities. For example, a focus on environmental science or sustainable business practices would shift the likelihood.
