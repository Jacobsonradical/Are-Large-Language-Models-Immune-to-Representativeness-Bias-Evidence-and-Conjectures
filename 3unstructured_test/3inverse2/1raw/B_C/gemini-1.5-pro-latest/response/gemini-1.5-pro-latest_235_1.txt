Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided is not definitive:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with common perceptions of individuals drawn to computer science.  The "quiet boy" aspect also fits a mild stereotype.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid over-relying on stereotypes. People's personalities and interests are diverse, and these probabilities are just educated guesses based on limited information.
