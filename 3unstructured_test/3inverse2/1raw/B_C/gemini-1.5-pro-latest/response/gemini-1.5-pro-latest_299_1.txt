Here's a breakdown of how we can approach estimating the probabilities, keeping in mind the limitations of the information:

**Understanding the Sketch:**

The personality sketch highlights traits that could be found in various fields:

* **Nature/Animals:**  Suggests potential interests in biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, but these aren't exclusive to these fields.
* **Puzzles/Abstract Concepts:** Points towards analytical and problem-solving skills, common in STEM fields, but also valuable in fields like finance, law, or even creative writing.
* **Empathy/Warm Heart:**  Desirable in many fields involving people, from healthcare to social work to business.

**Limitations:**

* **The sketch is general:** Many personality types could fit this description. 
* **Graduate student population is diverse:**  People's interests and chosen fields of study are varied.
* **We lack information on Adam's specific skills and passions:**  The sketch doesn't tell us if Adam excels at coding, has a head for business, etc.

**Estimating Probabilities:**

Given the above, it's impossible to give precise probabilities. Here's a reasoned approach:

* **Computer Science:** The sketch's emphasis on abstract thinking and problem-solving makes computer science plausible, but not definitive.  We'll assign a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While empathy is valuable in business, it's not a primary indicator. We'll assign a lower probability.

**Probability Estimates (Approximate and Subjective):**

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6", 
  "business administration": "0.3" 
}
```

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative. With more information about Adam's specific interests, skills, or experiences, the estimates could change significantly.
