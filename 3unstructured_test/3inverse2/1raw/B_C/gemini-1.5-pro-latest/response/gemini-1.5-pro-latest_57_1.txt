Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While someone with the described traits could certainly go into business, the emphasis on empathy and love for animals might be slightly less common in a stereotypical business program.  
* **Computer Science:** The profile mentions "enjoying solving puzzles" and understanding abstract concepts, which are strongly associated with computer science. This, combined with the high intelligence mention, makes it seem slightly more likely. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on very limited information and common stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and love animals, and many computer science students might not perfectly fit this description.
