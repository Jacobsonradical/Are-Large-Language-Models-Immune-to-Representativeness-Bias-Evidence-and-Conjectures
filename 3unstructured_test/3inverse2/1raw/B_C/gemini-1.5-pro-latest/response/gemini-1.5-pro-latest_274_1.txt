Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch mentions puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts - all traits often associated with computer science students. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality description leans more towards interests and traits often found in individuals drawn to fields involving nature or animals. 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are based on very limited information and rely on generalizations.  Many individuals in computer science and business administration possess the traits described. 
* Individual personalities within any field are diverse. This estimation is for fun and shouldn't be interpreted as a definitive assessment.
