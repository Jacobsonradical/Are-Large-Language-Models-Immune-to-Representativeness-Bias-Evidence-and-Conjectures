Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose guidelines based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (hard work, intelligence) are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking. These aren't as strongly associated with typical business student stereotypes.
* **Computer Science:** The sketch's emphasis on puzzles, abstract thinking, and intelligence aligns well with common perceptions of computer science students.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and nature-loving, just as many in computer science might not fit the "puzzle-solver" mold.
* **Individual variation is vast:** Graduate programs attract diverse personalities. Adam's specific interests within each field could significantly impact these probabilities.
* **This is highly speculative:** Without more information about Adam's specific skills, passions, and goals, these probabilities are just educated guesses.
