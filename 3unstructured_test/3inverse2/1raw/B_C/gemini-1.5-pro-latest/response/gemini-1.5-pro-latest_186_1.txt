Here's a breakdown of the probabilities and my reasoning:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving â€“ all traits often associated with computer science students.  However, the strong connection to nature and animals might be seen as less typical. Thus, the probability is moderate.

* **Business Administration:** The profile lacks strong indicators typically associated with business administration students, such as a focus on leadership, management, or financial acumen. The emphasis on empathy and nature could even suggest a lower likelihood. Therefore, the probability is lower than computer science. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are very rough estimates. Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. 
* Many individuals in computer science or business administration could have the traits described. 
* This assessment relies on general stereotypes and doesn't account for individual variations within any field.
