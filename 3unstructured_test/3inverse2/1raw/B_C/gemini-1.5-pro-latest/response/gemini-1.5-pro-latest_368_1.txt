Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizing puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence aligns strongly with common perceptions of computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch's focus on nature, animals, and understanding hard work doesn't create as strong a connection to business administration.  

**Important Notes:**

* These are just probabilities based on stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration share the described traits, and many computer science students may not.  
* Individual personalities are diverse, and field of study is just one factor among many.
