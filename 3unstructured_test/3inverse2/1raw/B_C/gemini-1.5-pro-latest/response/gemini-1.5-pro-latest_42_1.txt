Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on stereotypes associated with the personality description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. However, the strong connection to nature and empathy might be seen as less typical, lowering the probability.
* **Business Administration:** This field is often associated with ambition, leadership, and a focus on financial success. While the description doesn't contradict these traits, it doesn't strongly suggest them either. The emphasis on empathy and love for animals might be seen as less common in a stereotypical business student, resulting in a lower probability.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative and rely on generalizations. It's crucial to avoid using personality sketches to predict someone's field of study in reality.  Individual personalities within any field are incredibly diverse.
