Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The personality sketch aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence are common traits in that field. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be slightly less common. 
* **Business Administration:** This personality sketch seems less aligned with a typical business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the focus on nature, empathy, and potentially quieter personality traits are less stereotypical. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on very general assumptions. Many individuals in computer science and business administration defy these stereotypes.  Personality is complex, and this sketch provides a limited view.
