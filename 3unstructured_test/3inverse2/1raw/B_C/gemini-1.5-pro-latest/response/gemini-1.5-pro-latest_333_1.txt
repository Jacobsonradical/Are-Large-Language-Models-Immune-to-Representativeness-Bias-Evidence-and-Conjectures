Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are based on stereotypes and the information given is very limited:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts â€“ all traits often associated with computer science.  The love of nature and animals is less typical but not unheard of in this field.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and many computer scientists are passionate about nature. This exercise shouldn't be used to make assumptions about individuals in these fields.
