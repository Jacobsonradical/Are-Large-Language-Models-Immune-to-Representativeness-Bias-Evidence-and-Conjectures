Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in business students, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. This makes it seem more likely, but not definitive.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities rely on general perceptions of these fields.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic, and many computer science students may not fit the "puzzle-solver" mold.
* **Individuality:**  Personality sketches offer a glimpse, not a complete picture. Adam's specific interests within each field could heavily influence his choice. 

It's impossible to determine Adam's field with certainty based on the information given.
