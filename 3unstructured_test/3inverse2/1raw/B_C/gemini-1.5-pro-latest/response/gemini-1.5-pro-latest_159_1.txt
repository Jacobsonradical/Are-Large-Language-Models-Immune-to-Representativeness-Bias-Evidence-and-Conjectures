Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes abstract thinking and puzzle-solving, traits often associated with computer science.  However, the strong connection to nature and empathy might be seen as less typical (though not unheard of!) in this field. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality sketch's focus on nature, animals, and empathy aligns less with common perceptions of business administration students.

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on limited information and general tendencies.  Many individuals in computer science and business administration possess the traits described.  It's crucial to avoid stereotyping when thinking about individual students and their fields of study.
