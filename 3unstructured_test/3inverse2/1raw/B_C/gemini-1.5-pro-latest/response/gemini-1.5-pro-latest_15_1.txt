Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch might relate to the fields and a probability estimation:

**Analysis**

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:** This trait is not strongly associated with either computer science or business administration.  
* **Quiet, enjoys puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts:** These strongly suggest an aptitude for computer science. 
* **Warm heart, strong empathy:** These are not particularly indicative of either field, though perhaps slightly less common in stereotypical business environments.
* **Love for animals:** This is not strongly associated with either field.
* **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication:** This is applicable to both fields, though perhaps more expected in demanding graduate programs.

**Probability Estimation**

Given the strong alignment of several personality traits with computer science, it's more likely the sketch describes someone *not* in that field. 

Here's my estimation:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on stereotypes and general observations. Individual personalities within any field are diverse, and this is just a rough estimation.
