Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (intelligence, hard work) are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking. These are less typical (though not unheard of!)  in individuals drawn to business administration.
* **Computer Science:** The sketch aligns well with common perceptions of computer science students.  Puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and a certain quietness are often associated with the field. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** My response relies on general stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration are nature-loving and empathetic, and many computer science students don't fit the "quiet, puzzle-solver" mold.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality but doesn't offer concrete evidence against him pursuing any field. 
* **Individual Variation:**  People are complex.  Adam could easily defy expectations and be drawn to a field for reasons not captured in this brief sketch.
