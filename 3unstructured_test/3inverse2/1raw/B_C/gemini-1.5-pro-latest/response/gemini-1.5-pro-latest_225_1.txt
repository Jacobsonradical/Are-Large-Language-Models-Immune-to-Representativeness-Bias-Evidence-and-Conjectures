Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and some very general statistics:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights intelligence, problem-solving skills, and an understanding of abstract concepts - all traits often associated with computer science students. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less common in that field. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence is certainly valuable in business, the personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a drive for the competitive or financially-focused aspects often associated with business administration. The emphasis on empathy and appreciation for hard work could be applicable, but aren't specifically indicative of this field.

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality Sketch Limitations:** Personality sketches are broad and can fit many individuals across diverse fields.  
* **Individual Variation:** There are highly empathetic computer scientists and nature-loving business people. Stereotypes don't represent the full spectrum within any field.
* **Limited Information:**  We know very little about Adam's specific skills, interests, or aspirations beyond this sketch. 

**Therefore, these probabilities are simply estimations based on general perceptions and should not be interpreted as definitive judgments about individuals in these fields.**
