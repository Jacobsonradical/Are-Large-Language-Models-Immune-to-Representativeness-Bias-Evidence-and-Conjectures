Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind that this is based solely on a short personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence, all of which are traits often associated with computer science students. However, the strong connection to nature and animals might be considered less typical. Hence, a moderate probability. 

* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch doesn't strongly suggest a focus on business-related interests like finance, marketing, or management. The emphasis on empathy and nature further reduces the likelihood. Therefore, the probability is lower than computer science. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Limited Information:** Personality sketches are just glimpses. Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
* **Stereotypes:** My assessment might be influenced by common stereotypes about different fields, which are not always accurate.
* **Individual Variation:** There's a wide range of personalities within any field.
