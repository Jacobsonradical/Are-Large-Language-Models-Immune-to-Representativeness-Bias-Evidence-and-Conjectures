Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on the provided personality sketch and some general stereotypes associated with these fields.  It's important to remember that individuals within any field are diverse!

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6 Probability):** The description emphasizing problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence aligns well with common perceptions of computer science students.  The enjoyment of puzzles further suggests an affinity for logic and pattern recognition often found in the field.

* **Business Administration (0.3 Probability):** While some aspects of the description (hard work, dedication) could apply to business students, the strong emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy might be seen as less typical compared to someone in a more technical field like computer science. 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly subjective and should not be interpreted as definitive assessments. 
*  Many individuals in business administration value empathy and have diverse interests. Similarly, plenty of computer science students are deeply connected to nature. 
* Real-world personality assessments are far more complex and nuanced than this simplified example.
