Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The description doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and abstract thinking aligns less with common perceptions of business students. 
* **Computer Science:**  The profile aligns well with common stereotypes of computer science students: problem-solving, abstract thinking, and a quiet disposition.  However, the strong nature and animal connection might be considered less typical.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and don't reflect the diverse reality of students in each field. 
* **Limited Information:** We know very little about Adam. His specific interests within computer science (if he were in that field) or other experiences could drastically change these probabilities.
* **Individual Variation:**  Many individuals with these personality traits excel in diverse fields.
