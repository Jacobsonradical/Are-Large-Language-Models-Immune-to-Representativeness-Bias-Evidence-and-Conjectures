Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits aren't exclusive to any field, they might be considered less typical (though not impossible) for someone drawn to the competitive and often profit-focused world of business administration. 
* **Computer Science:**  The sketch highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding of abstract concepts. These are often associated with individuals drawn to computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals might be considered slightly less common in this field, hence a probability below 0.7.

**Important Notes:**

* These are just rough estimates based on general perceptions.  Individual personalities within any field vary greatly.
*  Many people in business administration are empathetic and animal lovers. Similarly, many computer scientists are deeply connected to nature.
* Without more information about Adam's specific interests and skills, it's impossible to give a more accurate assessment.
