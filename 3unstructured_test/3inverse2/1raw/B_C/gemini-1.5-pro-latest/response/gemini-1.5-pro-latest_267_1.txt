Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly subjective and based on stereotypes associated with the fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in business students, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for someone in a more scientifically or nature-oriented field. 
* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with computer science. However, the strong nature focus might be considered less typical for the field.

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes. It's impossible to accurately determine someone's field of study solely based on a personality sketch.
