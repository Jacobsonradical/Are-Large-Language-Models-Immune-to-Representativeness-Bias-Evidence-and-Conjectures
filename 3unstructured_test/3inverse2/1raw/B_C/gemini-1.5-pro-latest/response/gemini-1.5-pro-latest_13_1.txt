Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very broad stereotypes and individual personalities are diverse:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While the description mentions "understanding hard work and dedication," which could apply to business, the core personality leans towards scientific curiosity (nature, puzzles, abstract concepts).  This makes it slightly less likely he'd be in business administration.
* **Computer Science:**  The love of puzzles, abstract thinking, and potentially nature (bioinformatics is a field within computer science) makes computer science a more likely fit. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are very subjective. Many people with the described personality thrive in business fields, perhaps with a focus on sustainability or ethical practices.  Similarly, someone could have these traits and choose a completely different field like biology or environmental science.
