Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love for nature and animals, while not exclusive to computer science, doesn't contradict it either.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature, animals, and quiet contemplation aligns less strongly with the typical perception of a business administration student.  

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on stereotypes. It's crucial to remember that people's personalities and interests are diverse, and there are plenty of individuals in both fields who defy these common assumptions.
