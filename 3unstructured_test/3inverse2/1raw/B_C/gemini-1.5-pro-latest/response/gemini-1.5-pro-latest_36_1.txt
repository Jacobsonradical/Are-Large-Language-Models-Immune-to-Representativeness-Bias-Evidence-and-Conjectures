Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on very limited information and broad stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes intellectual curiosity, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking, all of which are strongly associated with computer science.  However, the strong focus on nature and empathy, while not uncommon in computer science, might be slightly less typical.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence is certainly valuable in business, the personality sketch emphasizes qualities that are not always stereotypical of business students (e.g., deep love for animals, appreciation for hard work).  This doesn't rule it out, but it makes it seem somewhat less likely based on the provided information.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are very subjective and rely on broad generalizations.  Many individuals in computer science and business administration possess the qualities described in the sketch.
