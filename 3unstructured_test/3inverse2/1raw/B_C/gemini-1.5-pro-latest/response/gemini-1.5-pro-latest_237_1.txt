Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) align well with a computer science student. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be slightly less common in this field. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality sketch emphasizes traits (nature, empathy, animals) not as strongly associated with a typical business administration student. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality traits are not definitive indicators of a person's field of study. There are many compassionate and nature-loving individuals in both computer science and business administration.
