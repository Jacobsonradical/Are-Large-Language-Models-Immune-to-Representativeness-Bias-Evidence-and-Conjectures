Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch aligns somewhat with a computer science student. Problem-solving, abstract thinking, and even a love for nature (bioinformatics exists!) are possible fits. However, it lacks strong markers we might associate *more* with CS like a passion for technology or building systems. 
* **Business Administration:**  The description is less typical of someone drawn to business administration. While intelligence and hard work are valued, business programs often attract those with stronger social skills and an interest in leadership, finance, or marketing, which aren't emphasized here.

**Important Notes:**

* **Individual Variation:** These are broad generalizations.  Many computer science students love animals, and many business students are deeply empathetic. 
* **Limited Information:**  The sketch is brief.  A few more details could drastically change the probabilities. 
* **Stereotypes:** My assessment relies on common perceptions of these fields, which aren't always accurate.
