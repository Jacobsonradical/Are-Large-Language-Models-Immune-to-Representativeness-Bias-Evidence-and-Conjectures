Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as other fields. 
* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with computer science. This makes it seem more likely, but not guaranteed.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities rely on common perceptions of these fields, which are not always accurate.  
* **Individual Variation:** There's a vast range of personalities within any field. Many compassionate and nature-loving individuals thrive in business. 
* **Limited Information:** We know very little about Adam's specific skills, interests, or career goals beyond this sketch.
