Here's an interpretation of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with common perceptions of computer science students. This, coupled with the high intelligence mention, makes it seem slightly more likely.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly subjective.  People are diverse, and a personality sketch can only offer limited insight. It's crucial to avoid strong assumptions about someone's field of study based solely on such a sketch.
