Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes analytical skills ("solving puzzles"), abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the description's focus on nature, animals, and quiet contemplation aligns less strongly with typical perceptions of business administration students. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities rely on general perceptions of these fields. Many individuals in business administration value nature and empathy, and many computer science students might not fit the "quiet" description.
* **Limited Information:** We know very little about Adam's specific interests within each field. A passion for sustainable business or animal-related technology could easily shift these probabilities.
