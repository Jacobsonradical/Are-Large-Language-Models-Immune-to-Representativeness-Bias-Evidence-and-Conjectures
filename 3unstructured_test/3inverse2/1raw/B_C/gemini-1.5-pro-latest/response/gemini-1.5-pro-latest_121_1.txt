Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the emphasis on nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts points away from a typical business student profile. 
* **Computer Science:**  The love for puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with common traits of computer science students.  This field often attracts individuals with a strong analytical and problem-solving mindset. 

**Important Note:**  These are just rough estimates based on common perceptions.  Many individuals in business administration value nature and empathy, and many computer science students might not be as interested in those areas.  Personality is complex, and people within any field represent a diverse range of interests and traits.
