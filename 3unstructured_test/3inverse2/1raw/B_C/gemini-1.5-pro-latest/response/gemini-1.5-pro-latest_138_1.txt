Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ all traits often associated with computer science students. However, there's no direct mention of technology or programming, so the probability is moderate. 
* **Business Administration:** This field is less aligned with the personality description. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the focus on nature, empathy, and a love for animals doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. Hence, the probability is lower.

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses based on stereotypes.  People's personalities and interests are diverse, and there's significant overlap between fields. It's entirely possible for someone with this description to thrive in either computer science or business administration.
