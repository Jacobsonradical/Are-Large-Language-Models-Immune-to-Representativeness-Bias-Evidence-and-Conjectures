Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch provides limited information:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (hard work, intelligence) are relevant to business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and a love for animals. These aren't strong stereotypes associated with business programs.
* **Computer Science:**  The sketch highlights puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence, which align with common perceptions of computer science students. This makes it slightly more likely, but not definitively, that Adam might be in computer science. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities are based on general perceptions. Many individuals in business administration are nature lovers, and many computer science students might not fit the described personality.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch is brief. More details about Adam's hobbies, interests, and skills would significantly impact the probability estimates.
