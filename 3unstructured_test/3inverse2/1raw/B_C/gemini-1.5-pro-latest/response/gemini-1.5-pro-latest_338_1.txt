Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, intelligence) are often associated with computer science students. This makes it somewhat likely, but not definitive.
* **Business Administration:**  The profile lacks strong indicators typically associated with business administration like leadership, ambition, or strong communication skills.  While someone with these personality traits could certainly pursue business, it might be considered slightly less likely based on the description alone.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases.  Many individuals in computer science are deeply empathetic and nature-loving, and many in business are drawn to it for ethical and problem-solving reasons. This assessment is purely based on probabilistic tendencies and not definitive judgments.
