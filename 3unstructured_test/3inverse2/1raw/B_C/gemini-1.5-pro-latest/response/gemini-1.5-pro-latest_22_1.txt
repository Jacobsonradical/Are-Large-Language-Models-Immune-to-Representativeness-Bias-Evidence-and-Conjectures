Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch relates to the fields and the resulting probability estimates:

**Analysis:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) are strong indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and a love for animals. These traits are less common focuses in typical business administration programs.

**Probability Estimates:**

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* The probability for computer science is higher because the described traits align well with skills and interests often found in that field. 
* The probability for business administration is lower because the personality description leans more towards interests and values that are not as central to the field. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on general stereotypes and the provided information. It's crucial to remember that individual personalities within any field are highly diverse.
