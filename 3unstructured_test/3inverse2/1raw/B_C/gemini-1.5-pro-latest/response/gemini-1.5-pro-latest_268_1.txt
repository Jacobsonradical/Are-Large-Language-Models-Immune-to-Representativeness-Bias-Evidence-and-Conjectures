Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love for nature and animals doesn't contradict this. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, the description leans more towards interests often found in STEM fields. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. Many individuals in business administration could have the described traits, and many computer science students might not.
