Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on stereotypes associated with the personality description and the fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence, traits often associated with computer science students.  His love for nature might be less common in this field but isn't unheard of.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the description's focus on nature, animals, and quiet contemplation aligns less strongly with the typical perception of business administration students. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. Many individuals in business administration could have these traits, just as many computer science students might not.
