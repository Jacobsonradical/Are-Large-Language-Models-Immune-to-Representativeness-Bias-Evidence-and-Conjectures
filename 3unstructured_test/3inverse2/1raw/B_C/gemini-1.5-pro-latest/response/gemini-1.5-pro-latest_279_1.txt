Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch aligns somewhat well with a computer science student.  Puzzles, abstract thinking, and intelligence are common traits in that field. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals is less typical. 
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch aligns less strongly with a typical business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the other traits (love of nature, empathy) are less central to the field.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly subjective.  Many individuals in computer science share the described love for nature, and many in business administration have deep empathy.  It's crucial to avoid overgeneralizing based on personality sketches and stereotypes.
