Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The personality sketch aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Puzzle-solving skills, abstract thinking, and intelligence are valuable in this field. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be considered less common in the stereotypical view of computer science students.  

* **Business Administration:** The sketch aligns less strongly with a typical business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the focus on nature, empathy, and a love for animals doesn't fit the stereotype as strongly as it might for computer science.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes. There's a wide range of personalities within any field, and it's impossible to determine Adam's actual field of study with certainty.
