Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on stereotypes associated with the personality description:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes abstract thinking, problem-solving (puzzles), and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with those drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the description's focus on nature, empathy, and a quiet demeanor aligns less strongly with the stereotypical image of a business student. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities rely on generalizations. Many individuals in business administration share the described traits, and many computer science students might not.
* **Individuality:**  Personality is complex. This sketch provides a glimpse, but countless other factors influence Adam's actual field of study. 

This exercise is more about recognizing how personality traits are often perceived in relation to different fields, rather than making a definitive judgment about Adam's actual academic path.
