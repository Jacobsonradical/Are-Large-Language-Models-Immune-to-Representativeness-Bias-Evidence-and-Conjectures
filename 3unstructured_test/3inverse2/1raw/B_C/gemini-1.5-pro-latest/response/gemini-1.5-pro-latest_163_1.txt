Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch relates to the fields and a probability estimation:

**Analysis**

The personality description leans towards interests and traits often associated with scientific or analytical fields:

* **Nature/Plant Curiosity:**  Suggests biology, environmental science, or related areas.
* **Puzzle Solving & Abstract Thinking:**  Common in STEM fields, including computer science.
* **Warm Heart/Empathy:**  While not field-specific, this might slightly decrease the likelihood of fields like business administration, which often focus on more objective outcomes.

**Probability Estimations**

Since the description doesn't strongly align with the typical image of a business administration student, the probability there is lower. Computer science aligns better with the analytical traits mentioned.

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Important Note:** These are very rough estimates. Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. Many people in business administration might love nature, and many computer scientists might not.
