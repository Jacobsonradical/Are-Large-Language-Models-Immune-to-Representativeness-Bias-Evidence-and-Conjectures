Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and a very limited personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some traits (intelligence, hard work) are valued in business, the description emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking, which are less stereotypical of business students. 
* **Computer Science:**  The puzzle-solving aptitude, high intelligence, and comfort with abstract concepts align well with the stereotype of a computer science student. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and potential biases.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and connected to nature, and many computer scientists have a passion for animals and the outdoors. This exercise is about recognizing potential correlations, not making definitive judgments.
