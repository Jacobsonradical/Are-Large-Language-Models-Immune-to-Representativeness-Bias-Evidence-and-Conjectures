Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes logical thinking ("solving puzzles"), understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love for nature and animals doesn't contradict this.
* **Business Administration:** While some aspects of the sketch (hard work, dedication) could apply to business students, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and abstract thinking makes it seem less likely.

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective assessment based on stereotypes.  Many individuals in business administration possess the traits described, and many computer science students might not. This estimation shouldn't be taken as a definitive judgment.
