Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat well with a computer science student.  Puzzles, abstract thinking, and intelligence are common traits. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be slightly less common in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the core interests described (nature, animals, empathy) are less typical focuses for business students.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  People's personalities and interests are diverse, and there are individuals who defy stereotypes in every field.
