Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with common perceptions of individuals drawn to computer science.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Individual Variation:**  Personality traits are highly diverse within any field. Many individuals in business administration may share the described traits, and many in computer science may not.
* **Limited Information:**  The sketch provides a limited snapshot of Adam's personality. Other interests, experiences, and skills would paint a more complete picture.

These probabilities are simply educated guesses based on general perceptions.
