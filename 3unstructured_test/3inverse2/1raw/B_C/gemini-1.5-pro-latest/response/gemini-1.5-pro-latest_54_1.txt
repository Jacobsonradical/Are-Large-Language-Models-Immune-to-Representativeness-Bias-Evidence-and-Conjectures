Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this, followed by my assessment:

**Reasoning:**

* **Stereotypes vs. Reality:** It's tempting to rely on stereotypes (e.g., "computer science students are less interested in nature"). However, these are often inaccurate and limiting. 
* **Personality Sketch Breadth:** The sketch provides a broad personality profile. Many personality types can excel in diverse fields.
* **Graduate Student Diversity:** Graduate programs attract individuals with a wide range of interests, even within traditionally defined fields. 

**Assessment:**

Given the above, it's impossible to determine with high confidence the likelihood of Adam being in one field versus another based solely on the personality sketch. The description could easily fit a graduate student in any of the listed fields.

**Probabilities:**

While I can't give definitive probabilities, I'd assign relatively similar values to both fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.45"
}
```

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on limited information and should not be interpreted as definitive predictions. The slight difference is simply to acknowledge that while the personality sketch *could* fit either field, some elements (enjoying puzzles, understanding abstract concepts) might be slightly more common in computer science graduate programs.
