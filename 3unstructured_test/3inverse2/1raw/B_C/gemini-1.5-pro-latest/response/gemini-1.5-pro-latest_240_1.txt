Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on very limited information and broad stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (intelligence, hard work) are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking. These aren't as strongly associated with typical business student profiles. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description aligns more closely with potential stereotypes of computer science students: puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and a quiet disposition. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and potential biases.  Many individuals in business administration could easily fit the personality sketch, and many computer science students might not.  Personality is complex and varies greatly within any field.
