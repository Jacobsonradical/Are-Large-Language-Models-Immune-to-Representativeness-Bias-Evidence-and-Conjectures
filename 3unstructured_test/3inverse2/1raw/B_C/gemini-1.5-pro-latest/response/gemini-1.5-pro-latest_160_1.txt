Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited stereotypical correlations:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The description highlights intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ all traits often associated with computer science students.  However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical, though not unheard of. 

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence is valuable in business, the personality sketch emphasizes traits (love for animals, empathy, appreciation for hard work) that are not as stereotypically associated with business administration students.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities are based on general perceptions and don't account for individual variation within fields.  There are plenty of compassionate computer scientists and nature-loving business professionals!
* **Limited Information:**  We only have a brief sketch. More information about Adam's specific skills, interests, and goals would drastically change the probability estimates.
