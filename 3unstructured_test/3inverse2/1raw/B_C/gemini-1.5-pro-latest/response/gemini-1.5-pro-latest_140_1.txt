Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on stereotypes associated with the personality description and not hard data:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence – traits often associated with computer science students.  The love of nature and animals doesn't preclude this, and many computer scientists have diverse interests. 

* **Business Administration:** While business administration programs attract intelligent individuals, the personality description lacks a strong emphasis on leadership, competitiveness, or financial drive – traits often associated with this field.  

**Important Note:**  These are very rough estimates based on stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration value empathy and nature, and many computer science students might not fit the description. It's crucial not to make assumptions about individuals based solely on their field of study.
