Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While the description mentions "understanding... hard work and dedication," which is relevant to business, the core attributes (love for nature, puzzle-solving, empathy) are less stereotypical of business students. It's not impossible, so the probability is moderate.
* **Computer Science:**  The emphasis on puzzle-solving, abstract concepts, and intelligence aligns strongly with common perceptions of computer science students.  This makes the probability higher, but not absolute, as these traits are found in other fields too. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These estimates rely on generalizations about academic fields, which are not always accurate. 
* **Individual Variation:**  There's huge diversity within any field. Plenty of computer science students love nature, and plenty of business students enjoy puzzles.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality but doesn't offer specific interests or skills that would dramatically alter the probabilities.
