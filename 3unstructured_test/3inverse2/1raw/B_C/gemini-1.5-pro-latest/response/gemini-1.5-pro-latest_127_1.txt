Here's my assessment of the probabilities, based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles"), understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence. These traits are strongly associated with computer science fields. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing.  

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. Many individuals with the described traits excel in diverse areas.
