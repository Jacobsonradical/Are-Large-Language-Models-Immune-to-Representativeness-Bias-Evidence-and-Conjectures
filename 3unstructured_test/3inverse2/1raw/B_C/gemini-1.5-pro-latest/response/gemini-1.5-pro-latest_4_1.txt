Here's my assessment of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description strongly aligns with traits often found in individuals drawn to computer science: puzzle-solving aptitude, abstract thinking, and high intelligence. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence, empathy, and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes a love for nature and animals, which is less directly relevant to this field. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on stereotypes.  Individual personalities within any field are incredibly diverse.
