Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and contains inherent biases:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less common (though certainly not absent!) in a typical computer science student.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch's focus on nature, empathy, and animals doesn't strongly align with the stereotypical image of a business administration student.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities rely on generalized assumptions. Many individuals in computer science are deeply empathetic and connected to nature, just as many businesspeople are passionate about animal welfare. 
* **Individuality:**  Personality sketches offer a limited view. There's not enough information to definitively say whether Adam is more likely to be in one field over the other.

**It's crucial to avoid using such sketches for real-world decision-making or profiling, as they are highly subjective and prone to bias.**
