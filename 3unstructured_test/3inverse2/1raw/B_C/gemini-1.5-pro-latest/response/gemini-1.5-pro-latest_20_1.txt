Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch relates to the fields and the estimated probabilities:

**Analysis**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in business students, they aren't as uniquely typical compared to other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The sketch highlights problem-solving skills ("enjoys solving puzzles"), high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts. These are strong indicators of someone potentially drawn to computer science.

**Probabilities**

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Explanation**

These probabilities are subjective.  The sketch leans more towards a computer science student profile due to the emphasis on analytical and problem-solving abilities. However,  it's important to remember that people are diverse, and these are just educated guesses.
