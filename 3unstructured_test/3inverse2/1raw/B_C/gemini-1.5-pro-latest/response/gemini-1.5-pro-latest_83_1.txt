**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch describes someone who enjoys problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciates hard work. These traits are commonly associated with both computer science and potentially business administration (depending on the specific focus within the field). 

However, the strong emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy might suggest a slightly lower likelihood of the subject being in computer science compared to business administration.  

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information. Many individuals in computer science share the described traits, and this assessment relies heavily on stereotypes.  It's crucial to avoid making assumptions about individuals based on their field of study.
