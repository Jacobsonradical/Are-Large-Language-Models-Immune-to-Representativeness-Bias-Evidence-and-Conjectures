Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided is not definitive:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While the sketch mentions intelligence and understanding hard work, it leans heavily towards interests more commonly associated with scientific or nature-related fields (curiosity about nature, love for animals).  Therefore, it's slightly more likely that Adam was *not* studying business administration. 
* **Computer Science:** The puzzle-solving ability and affinity for abstract concepts hint at a potential fit for computer science.  However, the lack of any direct mention of technology or programming makes it difficult to assign a strong probability. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study. People's interests are diverse, and these stereotypes don't reflect the full spectrum of individuals within any field.
