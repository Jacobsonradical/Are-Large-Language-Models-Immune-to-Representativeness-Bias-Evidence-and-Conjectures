Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving, all of which are strongly associated with computer science. This makes it slightly more likely. 
* **Business Administration:**  While the sketch doesn't directly contradict a business administration student, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and understanding hard work could be seen as less typical compared to someone in computer science. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities are based on general perceptions of these fields. There are plenty of individuals in business administration who love nature and are empathetic, just as there are computer science students who might not fit the described profile.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a narrow view of Adam.  Hobbies, experiences, and other factors could significantly influence his actual field of study.
