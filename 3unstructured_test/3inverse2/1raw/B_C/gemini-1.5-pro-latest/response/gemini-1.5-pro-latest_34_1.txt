Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat well with a computer science student.  Puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence are common traits in that field. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical. 
* **Business Administration:** This profile is less stereotypical of a business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the focus on nature, animals, and empathy might be less central.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and don't account for individual variations within each field.  There are plenty of nature-loving computer scientists and empathetic business professionals.
* **Limited Information:** The personality sketch is brief. More details about Adam's interests, hobbies, and goals would lead to a more accurate assessment.
