Here's a breakdown of how we can approach these probabilities, along with my estimates:

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes abstract thinking and problem-solving, traits common in computer science students. The love of nature and animals doesn't rule it out, as many people in STEM fields have diverse interests. 
* **Business Administration:** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, they aren't as specific to the field as the traits mentioned for computer science.

**Estimates:**

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a brief personality sketch. It's impossible to determine Adam's field of study with certainty. People are complex, and interests/skills often overlap across disciplines.
