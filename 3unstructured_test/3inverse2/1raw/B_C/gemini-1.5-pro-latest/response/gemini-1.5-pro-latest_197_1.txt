Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The description emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:** The emphasis on puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence aligns more strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities are based on generalizations.  Many individuals in business administration possess the described traits, and many computer science students might not.
* **Individuality:** People are diverse. The sketch provides a limited snapshot of Adam's personality.  His specific interests within each field could significantly influence the actual probability.
