**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch describes someone who enjoys problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciates hard work. These traits are commonly associated with both computer science and business administration. However, the strong emphasis on nature, empathy, and love for animals might be considered less typical for someone in those fields, particularly computer science.

* **Computer Science (0.4):** While problem-solving skills and abstract thinking are crucial in computer science, the other traits described are not as strong of indicators. Some individuals in computer science may have these interests, but they are not as directly related to the field's core focus.

* **Business Administration (0.6):**  Business administration attracts diverse personalities, and while analytical skills are essential, the connection to the specific traits outlined is weaker. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are subjective estimations based on general stereotypes and the provided information. It is crucial to remember that individuals within any field can have diverse interests and personalities.
