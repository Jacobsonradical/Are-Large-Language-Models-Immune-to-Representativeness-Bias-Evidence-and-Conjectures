Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.15"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence, all of which align with common perceptions of computer science students. However, the strong nature connection might be seen as less typical. Thus, the probability is moderate. 

* **Business Administration:** The sketch highlights empathy, understanding hard work, and a warm heart. While these are valuable traits in any field, they are not as stereotypically associated with business administration compared to fields like social work or non-profit management.  Hence, the probability is lower. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and generalizations. People's personalities and career choices are far more complex and diverse than stereotypes can capture.
