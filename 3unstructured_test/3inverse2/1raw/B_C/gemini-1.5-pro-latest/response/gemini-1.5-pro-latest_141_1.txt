Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence, all of which are strongly associated with computer science. However, the love for nature and animals is less typical, though not unheard of.  
* **Business Administration:** This field is often associated with interpersonal skills, ambition, and a focus on financial success. While the description mentions empathy, it doesn't strongly suggest the traits usually linked with business aspirations. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Many individuals in computer science and business administration possess the traits described.  It's crucial to avoid stereotyping individuals based on their field of study.
