Here's a breakdown of how we can assess the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

**Personality Traits and Common Associations:**

* **Curiosity about nature, love for animals:**  These traits are often associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. They are less typical of someone drawn to business or computer science, though certainly not impossible.
* **Quiet, enjoys puzzles, high intelligence, understands abstract concepts:** These traits are often associated with fields like mathematics, physics, engineering, and yes, computer science.  They could be applicable to someone in a quantitative business field, but perhaps less so in general business administration.
* **Warm heart, strong empathy:** These traits are valuable in many fields but aren't specifically indicative of any particular area of study. 

**Probabilities (with the caveat that these are very rough estimates):**

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2", 
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, the other traits point more towards science or nature-related fields.
* **Computer Science:** The puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence aspects align well with the stereotype of a computer science student. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid overgeneralizing. Many people in business administration are deeply empathetic and many computer science students have a passion for nature. This exercise is about probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes, not about making definitive judgments.
