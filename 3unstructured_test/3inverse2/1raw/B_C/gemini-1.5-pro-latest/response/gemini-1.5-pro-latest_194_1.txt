Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided is insufficient for accurate predictions:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (intelligence, hard work) are valued in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking. These aren't as stereotypical for someone drawn to the more pragmatic, results-oriented world of business.  
* **Computer Science:**  The puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence mentioned align well with common perceptions of computer science students. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals might be considered less typical.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** This assessment relies heavily on general stereotypes.  Many people in business are deeply empathetic, and many computer scientists love nature. 
* **Individual Variation:**  Personality is complex.  There are nature-loving businesspeople and deeply empathetic programmers. This sketch doesn't provide enough unique information for a confident prediction about Adam. 
* **Base Rates:**  The prevalence of these fields in the graduate student population would influence real-world probabilities. If there are far more business students than computer science students, it's more likely Adam is in business simply due to those numbers.
