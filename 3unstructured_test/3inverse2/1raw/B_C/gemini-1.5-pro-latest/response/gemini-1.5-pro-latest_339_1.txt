Here's my assessment of the probabilities, based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description of Adam aligns moderately well with a computer science student.  His love for puzzles, abstract thinking, and intelligence are common traits in that field. 
* **Business Administration:** The sketch aligns less strongly with a typical business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals doesn't fit the stereotype as strongly.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are based on general perceptions and stereotypes. There's a wide range of personalities within any field of study. This is just a probabilistic guess based on limited information.
