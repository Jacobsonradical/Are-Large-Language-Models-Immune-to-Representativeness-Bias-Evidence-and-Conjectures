Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided is not highly predictive:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, intelligence, understanding abstract concepts - all traits often associated with computer science students. This makes it slightly more likely Adam *wasn't* studying computer science, as the description aligns well with the field.
* **Business Administration:** While someone in business administration can certainly possess the traits described, they aren't as stereotypical for the field. This makes it a bit more likely that Adam *might* have been in business administration if the sketch is meant to highlight contrasting aspects of his personality.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are based on very limited information and rely on generalizations. It's impossible to accurately determine someone's field of study solely from a brief personality sketch.
