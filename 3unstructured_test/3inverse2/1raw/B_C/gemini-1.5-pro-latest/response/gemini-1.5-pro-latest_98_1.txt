Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description highlights traits often associated with individuals drawn to computer science: puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be considered less typical, lowering the probability slightly.

* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with this field, such as leadership, ambition, risk-taking, or a focus on financial success. The emphasis on nature and empathy further reduces the likelihood.

**Important Note:** This assessment is highly speculative. Personality sketches offer limited insight, and many individuals in ANY field may share these traits. Realistically, knowing Adam's actual field would require much more information.
