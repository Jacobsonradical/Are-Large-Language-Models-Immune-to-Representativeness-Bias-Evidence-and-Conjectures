Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information given is not definitive:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The description leans towards interests often associated with scientific or nature-related fields. While someone in business administration can certainly possess these traits, they are not as stereotypical. 
* **Computer Science:**  The puzzle-solving ability, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential aptitude in computer science. This field often attracts individuals with these characteristics.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and don't account for individual variations within fields.  
* **Limited Information:** The personality sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's interests but doesn't offer conclusive evidence for or against any specific field. 
* **Graduate Studies:** The fact that Adam is a graduate student suggests a higher level of specialization and interest in his chosen field, making it slightly riskier to assume he's in a different field altogether.
