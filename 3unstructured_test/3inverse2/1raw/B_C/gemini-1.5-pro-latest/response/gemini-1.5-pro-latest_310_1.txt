Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is purely speculative based on stereotypes associated with the fields.  Human personalities are diverse and don't always fit neatly into these categories.

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes abstract thinking and puzzle-solving, traits often associated with computer science. However, the strong connection to nature and animals might be seen as less common in this field. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the profile's emphasis on empathy, nature, and animals doesn't strongly align with the common perception of someone drawn to business administration.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid drawing strong conclusions about someone's field of study based solely on personality sketches.  These are just probabilities based on general perceptions.
