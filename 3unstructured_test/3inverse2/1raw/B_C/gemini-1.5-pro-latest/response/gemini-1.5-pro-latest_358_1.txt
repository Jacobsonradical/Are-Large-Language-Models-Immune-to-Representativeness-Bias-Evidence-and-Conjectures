Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a short personality sketch and stereotypes associated with the fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch aligns with some aspects of a computer science student (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, intelligence). However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals is less typical.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the core personality traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less aligned with the stereotypical image of someone drawn to business administration.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly subjective and based on limited information. It's crucial to avoid making strong assumptions about someone's field of study based solely on personality traits.
