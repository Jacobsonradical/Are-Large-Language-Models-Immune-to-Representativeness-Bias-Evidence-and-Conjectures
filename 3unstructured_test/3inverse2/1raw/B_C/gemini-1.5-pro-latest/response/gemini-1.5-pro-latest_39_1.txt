Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, animals, and quiet contemplation, which are less stereotypical of business administration students.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to understand that these are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field are incredibly diverse.
