Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description highlights intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving, all of which are strong indicators of someone potentially interested in computer science. This field attracts individuals with a curious and analytical mind, aligning with the sketch.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the profile lacks strong indicators typically associated with business aspirations like leadership, risk-taking, or a focus on financial success. The emphasis on empathy and nature suggests interests that might not be as central to a typical business administration path. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just estimates based on limited information.  Personality sketches are not definitive predictors of someone's field of study.
* Many individuals in business administration possess empathy and other traits mentioned.  The probabilities reflect a general trend based on stereotypical associations.
*  Adam's actual interests and motivations could lead him to any field, regardless of this sketch.
