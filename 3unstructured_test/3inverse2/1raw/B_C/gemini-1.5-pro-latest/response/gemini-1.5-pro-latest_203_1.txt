Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Puzzles relate to problem-solving, abstract concepts are key to programming, and there's a stereotype of introverted but intelligent people in tech. However, the nature and animal love aspects are less typical. 
* **Business Administration:**  This profile is less typical of a business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valued, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and potentially introverted qualities are less central to common perceptions of business students. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on generalized assumptions. Many individuals in each field defy these stereotypes.
* **Individual Variation:**  Personalities within any field are incredibly diverse. 
* **Limited Information:** The sketch is brief.  More details about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would drastically change the probability estimates.
