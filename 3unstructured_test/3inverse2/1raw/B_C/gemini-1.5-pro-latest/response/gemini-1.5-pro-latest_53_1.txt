Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  While the description emphasizes empathy and love for animals, it also highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding of abstract concepts â€“ all traits commonly associated with computer science students.  Thus, the probability isn't extremely low, but it's not a perfect match.
* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch leans more towards interests and traits less stereotypically associated with business administration.  A love for nature, quiet demeanor, and focus on empathy might be seen as less common in a field often associated with ambition, assertiveness, and financial drive. Hence, the probability is higher than for computer science. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities are based on generalized perceptions of these fields. Individual students within any field vary greatly.
* **Limited Information:**  The personality sketch is brief. More details about Adam's hobbies, passions, and career aspirations would significantly impact the probability estimates.
