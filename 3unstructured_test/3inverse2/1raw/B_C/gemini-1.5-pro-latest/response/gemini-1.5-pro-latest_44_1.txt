Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch relates to the fields and the estimated probabilities:

**Analysis**

* **Nature and Puzzles:** The description of enjoying nature and puzzles could suggest an affinity for scientific or analytical fields. This hints at a higher probability for computer science.
* **Empathy and Animals:**  While not directly related to the given fields, a love for animals and strong empathy might suggest a less competitive, possibly more research-oriented personality. This could slightly favor computer science over the typically more competitive field of business administration.
* **Abstract Concepts:**  Understanding abstract concepts is crucial in both fields but is perhaps more central to computer science (algorithms, data structures, etc.).

**Probabilities**

Considering these factors, here's a possible estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Important Note:** These are just estimations based on a brief personality sketch.  Individual personalities within any field are highly diverse. Many factors beyond this sketch influence a person's choice of study.
