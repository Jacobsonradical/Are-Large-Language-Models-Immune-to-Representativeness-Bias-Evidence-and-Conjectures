Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on very limited information and broad stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and abstract thinking â€“ all traits commonly associated with computer science students. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be considered less typical. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence is important in business, the personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a drive for the competitive or financially-focused aspects often associated with business administration. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic fields. There are many nature-loving, empathetic individuals in computer science and many intellectually curious and compassionate people in business administration.
