Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, intelligence, abstract thinking â€“ traits often associated with computer science. However, the strong connection to nature and empathy might be seen as less typical, lowering the probability somewhat.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the profile lacks strong indicators of ambition, leadership, or interest in financial systems, making it less likely.
