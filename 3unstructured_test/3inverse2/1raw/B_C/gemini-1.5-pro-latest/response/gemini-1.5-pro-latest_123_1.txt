Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are just educated guesses based on stereotypes and the provided description:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for someone in a more science-oriented field. 
* **Computer Science:** The description highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and an understanding of abstract concepts â€“ all of which are strongly associated with computer science.  

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid strong biases.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and love nature. Similarly, many computer scientists are passionate about animal welfare. This exercise is purely for demonstrating probabilistic thinking based on limited information.
