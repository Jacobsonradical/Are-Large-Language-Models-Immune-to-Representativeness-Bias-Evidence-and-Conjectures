Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles"), understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of business acumen, ambition, or interest in finance often associated with business students.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are based on general perceptions.  It's crucial to avoid overgeneralizing. Many individuals in business administration possess the traits described, and many computer science students might not fit this personality sketch.
