Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and understanding abstract concepts, all of which are strong indicators of someone potentially drawn to computer science.  However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals might be seen as less common in a typical computer science student.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence is valuable in business, the personality description doesn't strongly align with typical stereotypes of business administration students. The focus on empathy, nature, and a love for animals might be seen as less common in a field often associated with competitiveness and a focus on profit. 

**Important Note:**  These are very rough estimates.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study. Many people in computer science share the described traits, and many business administration students are deeply empathetic and connected to nature.
