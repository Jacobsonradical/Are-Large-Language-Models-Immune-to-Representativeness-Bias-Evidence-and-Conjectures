Here's a breakdown of how the personality traits might relate to the fields and the estimated probabilities:

**Personality Traits and Fields:**

* **Curiosity about nature/plants:** This trait is more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or botany, rather than business administration or computer science. 
* **Quiet, puzzle-solver:** This could suggest an affinity for analytical and problem-solving fields, making computer science a possibility.
* **Warm heart, empathy, love for animals:**  These traits are less directly tied to any specific academic field. 
* **High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts:** This is applicable to a wide range of fields, including both business administration and computer science. 

**Probability Estimates:**

Considering the above, here's a reasonable estimation:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and abstract thinking are valuable in business, the personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a passion for the core aspects of business like finance, marketing, or management. 
* **Computer Science:** The puzzle-solving aspect and ability with abstract concepts align well with computer science. This field attracts individuals who enjoy logical thinking and problem-solving. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on very limited information and broad stereotypes. An individual's personality is just one factor influencing their choice of academic field. Many other factors like personal experiences, career goals, and specific interests play a significant role.
