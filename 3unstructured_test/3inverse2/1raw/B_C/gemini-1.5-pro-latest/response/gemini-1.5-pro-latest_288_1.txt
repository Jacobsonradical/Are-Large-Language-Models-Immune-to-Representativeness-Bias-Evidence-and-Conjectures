Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a very brief personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The sketch highlights traits often found in those drawn to computer science: puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence.  However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals might be slightly less common in this field. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch's focus on empathy, nature, and animals doesn't strongly align with the typical image of someone drawn to business administration. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality Sketch Limitations:**  Personality sketches are incredibly general.  Many people with these traits exist across diverse fields. 
* **Individual Variation:** There's high variability within any field. Plenty of computer scientists are deeply connected to nature, and some business professionals have strong empathy and animal advocacy interests.
* **Limited Information:**  Knowing Adam's specific interests within his chosen field (if we had that information) would significantly impact these probabilities.
