Here's my attempt to quantify this, with the caveat that it's highly subjective:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes abstract thinking and problem-solving, traits often associated with computer science.  However, the strong connection to nature and empathy for animals is less stereotypical.  Therefore, I've assigned a moderate probability.

* **Business Administration:** The sketch lacks the typical traits associated with business administration, such as ambition, leadership, and focus on financial success. The emphasis on empathy and appreciation for hard work doesn't strongly point towards this field. Therefore, I've assigned a higher probability that the personality sketch is NOT about someone in business administration. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilistic guesses based on stereotypes.  Many individuals in both fields defy these expectations.
