Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The sketch emphasizes intellectual curiosity, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ all traits often associated with computer science students.  However, the strong connection to nature and animals might be slightly less common. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence is valuable in business, the sketch's emphasis on empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work doesn't strongly align with common perceptions of business administration students.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are based on broad generalizations.  Many individuals in computer science and business administration defy stereotypes.  A personality sketch alone is not a reliable way to predict someone's field of study.
