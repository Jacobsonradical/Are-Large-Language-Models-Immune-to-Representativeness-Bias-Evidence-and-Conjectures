Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. However, the strong connection to nature and empathy might be seen as less typical. Hence, a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence is valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business-oriented traits like ambition, leadership, or a focus on finance/markets. The emphasis on empathy and nature further lowers the probability. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study.  People's interests and aptitudes are diverse, and many individuals in any field might fit parts of this description.
