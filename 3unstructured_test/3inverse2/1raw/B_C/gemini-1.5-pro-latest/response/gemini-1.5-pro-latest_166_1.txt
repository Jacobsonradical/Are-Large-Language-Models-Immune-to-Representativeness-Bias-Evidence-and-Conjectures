Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (intelligence, hard work) are valued in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and puzzle-solving. These aren't as strongly associated with typical business administration student stereotypes. 
* **Computer Science:** The sketch's emphasis on puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence aligns more strongly with common perceptions of computer science students.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on generalizations. Many individuals in business administration value nature and empathy, and many computer science students might not fit the described personality.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a narrow view of Adam.  His actual interests and experiences in 2021 could significantly change these probabilities.
