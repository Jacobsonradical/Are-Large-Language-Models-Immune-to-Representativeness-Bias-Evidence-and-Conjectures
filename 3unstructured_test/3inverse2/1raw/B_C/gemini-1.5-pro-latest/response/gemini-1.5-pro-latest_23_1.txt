Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose estimations based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in business students, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:** The description of the subject enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with common perceptions of computer science students.  

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study.  These probabilities are based on very general assumptions and could easily be inaccurate.
