Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based purely on a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. The love for nature and animals, while not directly related, doesn't contradict this possibility.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests like leadership, finance, or market dynamics. The emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals leans away from a stereotypical business student profile.

**Important Note:** Personality sketches are highly subjective and shouldn't be used for stereotyping.  Many individuals in business administration could have the traits described, and many computer science students might not.  These probabilities are simply estimations based on common perceptions.
