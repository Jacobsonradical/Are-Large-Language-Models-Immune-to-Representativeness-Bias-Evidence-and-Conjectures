Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights traits often associated with individuals drawn to computer science: puzzle-solving aptitude, comfort with abstract concepts, and potentially high intelligence. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals might be considered less common in this field, lowering the probability somewhat. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with this field, such as leadership, ambition, risk-taking, or a focus on financial success. The emphasis on empathy and nature further reduces the likelihood.

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are subjective and based on general stereotypes.  Individual personalities within any field are incredibly diverse. 
* The sketch provides limited information. More details about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would be needed for a more accurate assessment.
