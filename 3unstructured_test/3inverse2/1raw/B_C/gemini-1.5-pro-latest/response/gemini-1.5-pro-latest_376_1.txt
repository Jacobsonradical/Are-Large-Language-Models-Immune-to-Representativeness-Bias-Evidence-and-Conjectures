Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat with a computer science student (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, intelligence). However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical. 
* **Business Administration:** The profile doesn't strongly suggest a business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the other traits (love for nature, empathy) are less stereotypical.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study. Many individuals in computer science are deeply empathetic and connected to nature, and many businesspeople are driven by more than just profit.
