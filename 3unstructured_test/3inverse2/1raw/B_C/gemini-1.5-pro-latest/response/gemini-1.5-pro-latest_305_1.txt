Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature. While these traits aren't exclusive to any field, they might be seen as less typical in a stereotypical business-oriented student.  
* **Computer Science:**  The emphasis on puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence aligns more strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities rely on general perceptions of these fields. Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic, and many in computer science may not prioritize nature.
* **Individual Variation:**  Personality is complex. This sketch provides a limited view, and many other factors influence a person's interests and career choices.
