Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The sketch emphasizes traits that could be found in various fields:** Curiosity, problem-solving, empathy, and intelligence are valuable in many areas, not just the ones listed.
* **Some aspects lean towards computer science:**  Enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are often associated with computational thinking.
* **However, the sketch isn't definitive:**  The love for nature and animals might suggest interests outside of traditional tech fields.

**Therefore:**

* It's plausible, though perhaps slightly less likely, that Adam could have been in **business administration**.  The personality traits don't directly contradict this field.
* It seems more probable that Adam was in **computer science** given the emphasis on puzzle-solving and abstract thought.

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses based on limited information.  Many individuals in business administration possess these traits, and many computer science students may not.
