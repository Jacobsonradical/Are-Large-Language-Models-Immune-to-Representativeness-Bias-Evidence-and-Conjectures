Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights traits often associated with individuals drawn to computer science: problem-solving skills, comfort with abstract concepts, and intellectual curiosity. This suggests a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes traits more aligned with scientific or nature-oriented fields. The lack of explicit mention of leadership, ambition, or financial interest makes the probability lower.

**Important Notes:**

* This is a highly subjective assessment based on limited information and stereotypes. There are many exceptions to these general tendencies. 
* The actual probability could be significantly different depending on other factors about Adam's background, interests, and goals.
