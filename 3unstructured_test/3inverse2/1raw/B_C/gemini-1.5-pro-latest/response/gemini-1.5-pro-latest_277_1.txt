Here's a breakdown of how to approach this question and my estimated probabilities:

**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch provides clues that might make certain fields of study *more* or *less* likely, but it's not definitive. Here's why:

* **Strengths:**  The description highlights intelligence, analytical thinking (puzzles), and an appreciation for hard work â€“ all traits applicable to many fields.
* **Nature Interest:** The love for nature and animals *could* suggest a field related to biology, environmental science, or even veterinary medicine. However, it could also simply be a personal interest.
* **Missing Information:** We lack crucial details about Adam's specific skills, career goals, and whether he leans towards practical or theoretical work.

**Estimated Probabilities:**

Given the limited information, here's my assessment:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Computer Science:**  While the analytical skills fit, the description lacks a strong indication of interest in technology, programming, or problem-solving in a digital context. 
* **Business Administration:** The sketch doesn't strongly point towards business either. However, intelligence, hard work, and understanding abstract concepts are useful in business.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative. With such limited information, it's impossible to be accurate.  A different sketch emphasizing different traits would lead to different probabilities.
