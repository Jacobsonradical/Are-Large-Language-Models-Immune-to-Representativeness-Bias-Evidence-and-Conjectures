Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns with some common perceptions of individuals interested in computer science, particularly the puzzle-solving aspect and abstract thinking. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical. 
* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While understanding hard work and dedication is important in business, the other traits (love for nature, empathy) are less traditionally associated with the field.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study. Many individuals in computer science are deeply empathetic and connected to nature, and many business professionals are driven by passion and a desire to make a positive impact.
