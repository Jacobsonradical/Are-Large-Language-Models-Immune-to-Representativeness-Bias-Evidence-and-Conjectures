Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights traits often found in individuals drawn to computer science: puzzle-solving aptitude, abstract thinking, and high intelligence. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be less common, pulling the probability down from a potential higher point.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business aspirations like leadership, risk-taking, or a focus on financial success. The emphasis on nature and empathy further lowers the probability.

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective assessment based on stereotypes and limited information.  The actual probability could be significantly different. Many individuals in computer science and business administration possess the traits described in the sketch, and conversely, people with these traits excel in diverse fields.
