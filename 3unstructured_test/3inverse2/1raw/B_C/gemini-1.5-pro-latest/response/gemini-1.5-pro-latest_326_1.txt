Here's an estimated probability based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch emphasizes traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding of abstract concepts. While these traits don't exclude someone from business administration, they align more strongly with fields like biology, environmental science, or potentially computer science (given the interest in puzzles and abstract thinking). 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Personality isn't destiny:**  Personality sketches offer loose correlations, not definitive predictions. Many successful individuals in business are empathetic and enjoy nature.
* **Limited information:**  We know very little about Adam's specific skills, interests within his field, or career aspirations. 
* **Graduate studies are diverse:** Both business administration and computer science encompass various specializations. Adam's specific focus within these fields would heavily influence the probability.

**In essence, while the sketch leans slightly towards computer science, it's crucial to remember that it's just a  general impression and not a reliable predictor of Adam's actual field of study.**
