Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch relates to the fields and the estimated probabilities:

**Analysis:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in business professionals, they aren't as strongly associated with the field compared to analytical thinking, strategic planning, and ambition.  
* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and a curiosity about nature (which can translate to systems thinking). These align strongly with the core skills and interests of many in computer science.

**Estimated Probabilities:**
