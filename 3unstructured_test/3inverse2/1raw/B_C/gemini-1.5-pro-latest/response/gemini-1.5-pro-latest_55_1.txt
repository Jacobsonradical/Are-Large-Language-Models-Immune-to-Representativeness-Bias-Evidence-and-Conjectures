Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on very limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Puzzle-solving skills, abstract thinking, and intelligence are common traits in that field. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be slightly less common.
* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a typical business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the focus on nature, empathy, and animals doesn't align as strongly. 

**Important Note:**  These are just rough estimates. It's crucial to remember that personality traits are not exclusive to any field of study. There are plenty of people in computer science who love nature, and many in business administration with deep empathy.
