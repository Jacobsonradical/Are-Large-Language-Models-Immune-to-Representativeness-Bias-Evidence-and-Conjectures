Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description highlights intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving â€“ traits often associated with computer science. This makes it seem slightly more likely that the sketch describes a computer science student.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study. Many people in business administration could have these traits, just as many in computer science might not.
