Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided is not definitive:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (intelligence, hard work) are valuable in business, the description leans towards interests less common in a typical business student. The emphasis on nature, empathy, and abstract thinking points away from a business focus.
* **Computer Science:** The description aligns well with potential stereotypes of computer science students: puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, quiet nature. The love for animals and nature isn't a contradiction, just less directly associated.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general impressions. Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic, and many in computer science don't fit the "quiet puzzle solver" mold. 
* **Individuality:** Adam's specific interests within each field could drastically change these probabilities. A focus on environmental sustainability in business or animal-related AI in computer science would significantly alter the likelihood. 
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality. Other factors like upbringing, life experiences, and specific skills are crucial in determining his actual field of study.
