Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on stereotypes associated with the personality description:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. The love for nature and animals doesn't contradict this.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the description's emphasis on nature, empathy, and a quiet demeanor aligns less with common stereotypes of business administration students. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on very general assumptions.  Individual personalities within any field vary greatly.
