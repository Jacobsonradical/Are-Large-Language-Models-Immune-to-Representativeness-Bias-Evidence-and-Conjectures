Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for analytical thinking ("solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "understanding abstract concepts"). These are highly valued traits in computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests (e.g., leadership, finance, marketing). The love for nature and animals might even suggest a preference for fields less focused on corporate environments.

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective assessment based on limited information.  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. Many individuals with these traits could thrive in business, education, research, or various other fields.
