Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. However, the strong nature connection could suggest other interests.  
* **Business Administration:** The sketch lacks typical business-oriented traits like ambition, leadership, or risk-taking. The emphasis on empathy and love for animals might be less common in a typical business program.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are based on very limited information and rely on generalizations.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study.
