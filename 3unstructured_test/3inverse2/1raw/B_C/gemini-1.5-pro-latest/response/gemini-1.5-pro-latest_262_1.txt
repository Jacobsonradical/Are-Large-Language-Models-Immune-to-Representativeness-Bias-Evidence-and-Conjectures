Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) strongly align with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature, animals, and understanding hard work doesn't immediately scream "business student." 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities are based on general perceptions. Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and nature-loving, just as many computer science students might not fit the described profile.
* **Individual Variation:**  Personality sketches provide a glimpse, not a complete picture.  Adam's specific interests within his chosen field could make him more or less likely to fit the description.
