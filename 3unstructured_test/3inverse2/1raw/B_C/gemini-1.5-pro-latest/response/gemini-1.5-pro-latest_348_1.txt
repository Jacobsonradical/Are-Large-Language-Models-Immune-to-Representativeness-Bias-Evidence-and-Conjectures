Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided is limited:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits are valuable in business, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for someone interested in nature and abstract concepts. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with the problem-solving nature of computer science.  His quiet nature might also be perceived as fitting the stereotype of a computer scientist.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid over-generalizing. These probabilities are based on limited information and common stereotypes. In reality, individuals in any field can possess a wide range of personality traits.
