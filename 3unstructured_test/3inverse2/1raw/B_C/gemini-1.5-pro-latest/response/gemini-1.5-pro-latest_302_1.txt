Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:**  While some personality traits (intelligence, hard work) are valued in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking. These aren't as stereotypical in business students, though certainly possible.
* **Computer Science:**  The puzzle-solving aspect, abstract thinking, and high intelligence align well with the common perception of computer science students.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities rely on generalized assumptions.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic, and many computer science students are passionate about nature. 
* **Individuality:** Adam's specific interests within each field could drastically change these probabilities. A focus on environmental sustainability in business or bioinformatics in computer science would make the sketch more likely. 
* **Limited Information:** The sketch is brief. More details about Adam's activities, skills, and values would lead to a more accurate assessment.
