Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and a very limited personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes intelligence, problem-solving, and abstract thinking â€“ all traits associated with computer science. However, the strong connection to nature and animals might be considered less typical for the field. 
* **Business Administration:** The profile lacks strong indicators typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, ambition, or a focus on finance and management.  The emphasis on empathy and love for animals might be seen as less common in a stereotypical business-oriented personality.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes are limited:**  It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on general perceptions. Many individuals in computer science and business administration defy these stereotypes.
* **Individual variation is vast:** Personality sketches provide limited information. There are many other factors that influence a person's field of study.
