Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on stereotypes associated with personality traits and academic fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While traits like intelligence, hard work, and understanding abstract concepts are valuable in business, the description heavily emphasizes nature, empathy, and a quiet demeanor. These are not as commonly associated with the stereotypical image of a business administration student.
* **Computer Science:**  The profile aligns more strongly with the stereotypical view of a computer science student: puzzle-solving aptitude, comfort with abstract concepts, and a quiet nature.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes are not absolute.** Many individuals in business administration possess the described traits, and many computer science students might not. 
* **Personality is complex.** A short sketch cannot fully capture someone's interests and aptitudes. 
* **Graduate studies add another layer.**  People's interests can become more focused and specialized at the graduate level. 

This exercise is more about recognizing potential correlations (however weak) than making definitive judgments about Adam's field of study.
