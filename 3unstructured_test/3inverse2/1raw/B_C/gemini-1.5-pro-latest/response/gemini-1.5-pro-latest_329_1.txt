Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are just inferences from a brief personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, understanding abstract concepts, high intelligence) align well with common perceptions of computer science students. This makes the probability higher, but not definitively high as these traits can be found in many fields. 
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch emphasizes empathy, warmth, and appreciation for hard work. While these are valuable in business, they are not as stereotypical as they might be for, say, social work or humanities fields. Hence, the probability is lower.

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality sketches are not definitive:** People are complex, and these sketches offer a limited view. 
* **Field choice is multifaceted:**  Factors beyond personality (career goals, financial considerations, etc.) heavily influence graduate program choices.
* **These are estimations:**  Without more data points about Adam or the overall graduate student population in 2021, these probabilities are subjective.
