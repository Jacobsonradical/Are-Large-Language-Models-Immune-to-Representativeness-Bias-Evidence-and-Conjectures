Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch mentions enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. These traits are often associated with computer science students, making it somewhat likely. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals might be seen as less common in this field.
* **Business Administration:** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While "understanding hard work and dedication" could apply, it's not a specific indicator for business administration.  The other traits (love for nature, empathy) are less commonly associated with this field.

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses based on stereotypes. Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study. Many individuals in computer science are deeply connected to nature, and many business professionals are empathetic and animal lovers.
