Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in business students, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. This makes the probability higher than business administration.

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on general perceptions.  Many individuals in business administration could easily fit the personality sketch, and many computer science students might not.  It's crucial to avoid overgeneralizing based on fields of study.
