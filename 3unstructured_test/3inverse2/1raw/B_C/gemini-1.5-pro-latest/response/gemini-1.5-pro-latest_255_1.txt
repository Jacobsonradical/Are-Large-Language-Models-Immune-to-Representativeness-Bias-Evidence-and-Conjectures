Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on general stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The description emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While some business students possess these traits, they aren't as centrally associated with the field compared to others. 
* **Computer Science:**  The sketch highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts â€“ traits often linked to computer science. This suggests a higher likelihood, though not definitively.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are incredibly unreliable for predicting someone's field of study. Many individuals in diverse fields could fit the description, and these probabilities are simply educated guesses.
