Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch could describe people in many fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some traits (intelligence, hard work) are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and possibly a more introverted disposition. These aren't as stereotypical for someone drawn to business administration.
* **Computer Science:** The puzzle-solving ability, abstract thinking, and quiet nature align more strongly with the image of someone interested in computer science.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and don't reflect the full diversity within fields. Many compassionate and nature-loving individuals thrive in business. Similarly, not all computer scientists fit the "quiet and introspective" mold.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch is brief. More details about Adam's specific interests, skills, and values would lead to a more accurate assessment.
