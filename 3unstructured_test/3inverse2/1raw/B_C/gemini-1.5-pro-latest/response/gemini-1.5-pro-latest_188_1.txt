Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The description highlights intellectual curiosity, problem-solving skills, and an aptitude for abstract concepts â€“ all traits commonly associated with computer science students. However, the strong emphasis on nature, empathy, and love for animals might be seen as less typical. 

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch doesn't strongly align with common perceptions of business students. The focus on nature, quietness, and empathy might be seen as less common in a field often associated with extroversion and a focus on profit and strategy. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on general perceptions.  Individual personalities within any field are incredibly diverse.
