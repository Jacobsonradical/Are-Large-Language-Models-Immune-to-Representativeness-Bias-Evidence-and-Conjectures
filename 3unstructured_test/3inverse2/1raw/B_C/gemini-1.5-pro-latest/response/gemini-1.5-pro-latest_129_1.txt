Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided is not definitive:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (intelligence, hard work) are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking. These aren't as stereotypical in business students, though certainly not unheard of. 
* **Computer Science:** The traits of puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence align more strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and don't account for individual variation within fields.  There are many compassionate and nature-loving individuals in business, and many computer science students who might not fit the "quiet, puzzle-solver" mold.
* **Limited Information:** We know very little about Adam's specific skills or interests beyond this sketch.
