Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on very limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The personality sketch aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Intelligence, problem-solving skills, and an appreciation for abstract concepts are common in this field. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be slightly less common.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence is valuable in business, the other traits described (love of nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are not as stereotypical for business administration students. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic pursuits, and many other factors influence a person's field of study.
