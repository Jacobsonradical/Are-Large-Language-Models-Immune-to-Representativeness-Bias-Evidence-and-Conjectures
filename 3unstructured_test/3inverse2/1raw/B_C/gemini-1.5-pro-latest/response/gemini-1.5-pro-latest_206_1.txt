Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the description is quite open-ended:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, intelligence, understanding abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the description's focus on nature, empathy, and animals doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination.

**Important Notes:**

* These are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes. Many individuals in business fields have deep love for nature, and many computer scientists might not fit the described personality. 
* Individual personalities are diverse, and fields of study don't dictate one's interests.
