Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some aspects of the sketch (hard work, dedication) could apply to business students, the emphasis on nature, animals, empathy, and abstract concepts doesn't strongly align with a typical business administration personality. 
* **Computer Science:** The description aligns well with common traits associated with computer science: problem-solving (puzzles), abstract thinking, and a potential interest in systems (nature's complexity). 

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration could possess these traits, and many computer science students might not.  Personality sketches are not definitive predictors of someone's field of study.
