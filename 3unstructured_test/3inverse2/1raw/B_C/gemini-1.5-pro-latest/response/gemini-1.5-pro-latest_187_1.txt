Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description highlights intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving, all of which are strongly associated with computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** While someone in business administration could share these traits, they aren't as stereotypical. The emphasis on nature, empathy, and understanding hard work doesn't lean strongly towards a business inclination.

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly speculative.  Many individuals in business administration possess the traits described, and many computer science students might not. 
* Personal interests and career choices are complex. This sketch doesn't provide enough information for a definitive prediction.
