Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are just educated guesses based on stereotypes and the provided description:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence â€“ all traits often associated with computer science students.  The quiet nature could also fit the stereotype. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the description's focus on nature, animals, and understanding hard work doesn't align as strongly with common perceptions of business administration students. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic pursuits, and many individuals in both fields defy stereotypes.
