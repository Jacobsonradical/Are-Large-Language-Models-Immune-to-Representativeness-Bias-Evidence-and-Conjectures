Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits like hard work and intelligence are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking. These aren't as stereotypical for someone drawn to business administration. 
* **Computer Science:** The traits of puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence align more strongly with stereotypes associated with computer science students.  

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on general perceptions. Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and interested in nature, just as many computer science students might not fit the described personality.  Personality sketches are not definitive predictors of a person's field of study.
