Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Puzzles, abstract thinking, and intelligence are common traits in that field. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals might be seen as less typical.  
* **Business Administration:** The sketch aligns less well with a stereotypical business administration student. The focus on empathy, nature, and animals might be seen as less common in a field often associated with competitiveness and profit-driven goals.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on very limited information and general perceptions.  Many individuals in computer science are deeply connected to nature, and many businesspeople are incredibly empathetic. This exercise is about recognizing potential biases, not making definitive judgments.
