Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. However, the strong connection to nature and animals might be seen as less common in this field.
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch highlights empathy and understanding hard work, which are relevant to business. However, the core interests in nature, animals, and puzzle-solving seem less aligned with a typical business administration student. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on stereotypes.  People's personalities and interests are diverse, and there are many individuals in both computer science and business administration who possess the traits described.
