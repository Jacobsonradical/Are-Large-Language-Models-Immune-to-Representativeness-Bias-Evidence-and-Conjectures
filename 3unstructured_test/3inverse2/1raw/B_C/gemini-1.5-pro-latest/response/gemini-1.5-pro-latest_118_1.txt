Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and stereotypes associated with different fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some traits like problem-solving and understanding hard work are relevant to business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thought more commonly associated with less "corporate" fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The love for puzzles and abstract thinking aligns well with computer science stereotypes.  However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals might be seen as less common in this field.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches offer limited insight, and people's interests and career choices are far more complex than stereotypes.
