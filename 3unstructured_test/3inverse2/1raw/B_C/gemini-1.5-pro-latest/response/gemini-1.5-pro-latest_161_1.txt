Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence are common traits in that field. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be less common, though not unheard of. 
* **Business Administration:** The sketch aligns less strongly with a typical business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and potentially quiet contemplation might be less common.

**Important Note:** These are very rough estimates.  Personality is complex, and many individuals in these fields defy stereotypes.  More information about Adam's specific interests and skills would be needed for a more accurate assessment.
