Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the personality sketch alone:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns well with some common perceptions of computer science students: puzzle-solving aptitude, abstract thinking, appreciation for complex systems (like nature!). However, the emphasis on empathy and love for animals is less stereotypical, lowering the probability slightly. 
* **Business Administration:** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the other traits point more towards scientific or nature-related fields.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and not on any individual's guaranteed traits. 
* **Limited Information:**  We have very limited information about Adam.  His actual interests and career choices could be far more diverse. 
* **Individuality:**  People are complex! It's impossible to accurately predict someone's field of study based on a short personality sketch.
