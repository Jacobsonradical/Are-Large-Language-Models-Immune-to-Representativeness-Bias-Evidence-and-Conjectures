Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes abstract thinking, puzzle-solving, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business, the sketch's focus on nature, empathy, and a love for animals suggests a personality potentially less drawn to the core aspects of a traditional business administration program.

**Important Note:** These are just estimations based on stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and connected to nature, while many computer scientists are passionate about animals.  This sketch doesn't provide enough information for a definitive answer.
