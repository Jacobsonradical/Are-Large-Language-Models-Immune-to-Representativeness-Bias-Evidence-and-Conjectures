Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes abstract thinking, puzzle-solving, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of typical business interests like finance, marketing, or leadership. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on general perceptions.  Adam's true field of study could be entirely different.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic specialization.
