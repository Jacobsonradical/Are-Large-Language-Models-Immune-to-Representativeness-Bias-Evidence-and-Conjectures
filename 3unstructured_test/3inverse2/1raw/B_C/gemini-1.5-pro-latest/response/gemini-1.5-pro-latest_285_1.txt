Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description's emphasis on puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence aligns strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the sketch's focus on nature, empathy, and animals doesn't fit the stereotypical image of a business student as strongly.  

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on general trends. It's entirely possible for someone with this personality to thrive in business administration. Individual interests and passions are far more important than stereotypes when choosing a field of study.
