Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind it's impossible to be definitive with just a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns well with a computer science student.  Problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence are key traits in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality description leans more towards interests often associated with science or nature-related fields.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Personality isn't destiny:** People with this personality type can be found in *any* field.  This is just a likelihood based on common stereotypes.
* **Sample Size:** We only have one data point (Adam). This makes generalizing very difficult.
* **Graduate School:** The fact that Adam is a graduate student suggests a higher level of dedication and focus, which could be applied to any field.
