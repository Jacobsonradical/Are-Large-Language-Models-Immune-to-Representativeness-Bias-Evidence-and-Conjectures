Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with computer science. The connection to nature and animals is less common but not unheard of in this field.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on vague stereotypes and should not be taken as definitive judgments about people in these fields. There's a wide range of personalities within any profession.
