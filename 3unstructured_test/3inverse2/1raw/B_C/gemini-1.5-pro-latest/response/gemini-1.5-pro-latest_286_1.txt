Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is fairly general:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits of puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence align well with computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less common in this field, though certainly not unheard of. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the other traits (love for nature, animals, quiet demeanor) are less stereotypically associated with this field. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on general perceptions. Many individuals in computer science and business administration possess the traits described. Individual personalities within any field are diverse.
