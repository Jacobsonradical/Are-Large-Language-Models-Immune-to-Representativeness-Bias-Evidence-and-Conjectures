Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat well with a computer science student. Problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence are common traits. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be slightly less common in this field.
* **Business Administration:**  The personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the focus on nature, animals, and empathy is less typical. 

**Important Note:**  These are very rough estimates.  People's personalities and career choices are complex. There are many compassionate and nature-loving individuals in computer science and business administration.  This exercise relies on general perceptions and doesn't reflect the true diversity within these fields.
