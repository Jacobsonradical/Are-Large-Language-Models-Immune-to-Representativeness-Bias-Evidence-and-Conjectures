Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch's details:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles"), understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of academic fields. Many individuals with these traits excel in diverse areas.
