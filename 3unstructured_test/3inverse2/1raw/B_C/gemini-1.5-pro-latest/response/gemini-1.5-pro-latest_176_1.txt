Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) strongly align with the skills and interests often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence, empathy, and hard work are valuable in business, the specific mentions of nature, animals, and a quiet demeanor are less typical indicators of someone drawn to this field. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on stereotypes.  Personality doesn't dictate career choice. Many passionate nature lovers thrive in business, and plenty of computer scientists adore animals.
