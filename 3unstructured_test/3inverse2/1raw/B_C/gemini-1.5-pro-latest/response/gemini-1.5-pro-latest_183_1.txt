Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose estimations based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While someone with the described traits could succeed in business, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and love for animals doesn't strongly align with typical business student stereotypes.  
* **Computer Science:** The puzzle-solving aptitude, high intelligence, and comfort with abstract concepts are strong indicators of potential success in computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy logic and problem-solving.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Individual Variation:** Personalities within any field are diverse. These probabilities are based on general perceptions and don't account for individual exceptions. 
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality but lacks information about his specific skills, interests, and career aspirations.

**In summary, based on the provided sketch, it's slightly more likely that Adam was a graduate student in a field other than business administration compared to computer science. However, these are just estimations and shouldn't be interpreted as definitive conclusions.**
