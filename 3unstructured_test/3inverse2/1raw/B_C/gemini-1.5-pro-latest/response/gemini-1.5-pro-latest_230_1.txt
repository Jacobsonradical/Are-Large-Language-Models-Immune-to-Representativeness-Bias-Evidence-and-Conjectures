Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes abstract thinking, puzzle-solving, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch's focus on nature, animals, and quiet contemplation doesn't strongly align with the stereotypical image of a business administration student.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes. There's a wide range of personalities within any field, and this sketch shouldn't be used to make assumptions about any individual's field of study.
