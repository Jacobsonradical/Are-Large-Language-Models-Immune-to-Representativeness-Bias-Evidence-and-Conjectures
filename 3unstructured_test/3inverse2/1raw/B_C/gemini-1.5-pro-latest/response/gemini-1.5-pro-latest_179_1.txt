Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and some general stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical skills ("solving puzzles"), abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. The love for nature and animals doesn't contradict this and might even suggest an interest in bioinformatics or computational biology.
* **Business Administration:** While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks a strong indication of traits often linked to business aspirations like leadership, ambition, or financial interest.  

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of academic fields. Many individuals with these traits excel in business, humanities, or various other areas.
