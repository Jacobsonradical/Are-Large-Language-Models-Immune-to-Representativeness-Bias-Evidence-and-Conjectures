Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes analytical skills ("solving puzzles", "understanding abstract concepts"), a common trait among those in computer science. His love for nature and animals might be seen as less typical but doesn't preclude him from the field. 
* **Business Administration:** While "hard work and dedication" are valued in business, the description leans more towards intellectual curiosity and empathy. These traits are not absent in business students but are less emphasized compared to fields like social work or even biology. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases. Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and intellectually curious, just as many in computer science have a passion for nature. This assessment simply uses common stereotypes to provide a rough estimate based on limited information.
