Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be in other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with common perceptions of those drawn to computer science.  The quiet, nature-loving aspect might be seen as slightly less common in this field, hence a probability slightly below 1.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities are based on generalized assumptions and don't reflect the full diversity within any field.
* **Individual Variation:** People are complex, and many individuals in business administration could easily fit the personality sketch, and many in computer science might not. 
* **Limited Information:** We know very little about Adam's specific interests or skills beyond this sketch.
