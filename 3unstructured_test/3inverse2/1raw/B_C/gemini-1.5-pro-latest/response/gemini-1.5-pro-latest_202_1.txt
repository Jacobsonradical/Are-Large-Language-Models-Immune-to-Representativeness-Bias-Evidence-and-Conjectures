Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on stereotypes associated with the personality description and not hard data:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat well with a potential computer science student.  Puzzles relate to problem-solving, and abstract thinking is key in programming. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals might be seen as less common in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less stereotypically associated with this field.

**Important Note:**  These are very rough estimates.  People's personalities and career choices are complex, and it's impossible to accurately predict someone's field of study based solely on a brief sketch.
