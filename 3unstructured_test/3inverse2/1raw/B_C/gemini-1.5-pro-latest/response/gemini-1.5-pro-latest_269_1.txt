Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving, all of which are strong indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science.  Therefore, the probability is moderate.
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch doesn't strongly suggest a leaning towards business. While empathy and understanding hard work are relevant in business, they aren't as specific to the field as the traits linked to computer science. Thus, the probability is lower.

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses based on stereotypes.  Many individuals with the described personality traits excel in business administration.  The sketch provides a limited snapshot and shouldn't be used to definitively categorize anyone's career path.
