Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based purely on a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch mentions enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, both of which align well with computer science. This field attracts individuals with a problem-solving mindset, making it somewhat likely. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with business administration like leadership, ambition, or strong interest in economics/finance. Thus, the probability is lower.

**Important Note:** Personality sketches are incredibly limited for predicting someone's field of study. Many individuals in computer science and business administration could share these traits, and many people with these traits choose entirely different paths.
