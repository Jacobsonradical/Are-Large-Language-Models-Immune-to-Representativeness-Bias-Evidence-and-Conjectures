**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch emphasizes traits often associated with scientific fields:

* **Curiosity about nature:** Suggests an interest in the natural world, which could align with biological sciences, environmental studies, or even some branches of computer science (like bioinformatics).
* **Enjoys solving puzzles:** This is a common trait among those drawn to analytical and problem-solving fields, including computer science, mathematics, and engineering.
* **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts:**  Essential for fields like computer science and, to a degree, business administration (though the sketch doesn't emphasize quantitative skills often prominent in business). 
* **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:**  A general positive trait, not particularly indicative of one field over the other.

**Why Computer Science is rated lower than Business Administration:**

While the puzzle-solving and intellectual aspects fit computer science, the strong emphasis on nature and animals suggests a potential inclination towards fields more directly related to those interests. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is highly speculative. Personality sketches are insufficient to accurately predict someone's field of study. Many individuals with these traits excel in various fields, including those not mentioned.
