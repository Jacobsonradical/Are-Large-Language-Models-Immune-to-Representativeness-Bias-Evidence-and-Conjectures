Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) strongly align with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, animals, and quietness, which are less stereotypical of business administration students.

**Important Notes:**

* These are just probabilities based on stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration could possess the described traits, and many computer science students might not.  
* Individual personalities are diverse, and field of study doesn't solely define a person.
