Here's an interpretation of the personality sketch and how it might relate to the given fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence, hard work, and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes a love for nature and animals. These traits are not as directly applicable to typical business administration roles. 
* **Computer Science:** The description of the subject enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with the problem-solving and analytical nature of computer science. This, coupled with his high intelligence, makes it more likely he'd be drawn to this field.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on limited information. The actual likelihood could be different. Many individuals with these traits excel in business fields, and some computer science students might not have a strong affinity for nature.
