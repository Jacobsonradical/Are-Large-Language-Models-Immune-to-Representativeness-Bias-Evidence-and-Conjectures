Here's my assessment of the probabilities, based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes traits often associated with individuals drawn to computer science: puzzle-solving aptitude, abstract thinking, and high intelligence.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits typically associated with business aspirations, such as a drive for leadership, risk-taking, or a strong interest in economics/finance.

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective assessment based on stereotypes.  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of a person's field of study.  Many individuals with these traits excel in business administration, while others with different personalities thrive in computer science.
