Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided doesn't guarantee Adam's field of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.4" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, understanding hard work, and potentially abstract concepts (depending on the specific area of business). These traits are often associated with successful business people, but they aren't exclusive to the field.  
* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights puzzle-solving, intelligence, and an affinity for nature. These align well with common perceptions of computer science students.  A love of nature might be seen as less typical in computer science, but it's not unheard of. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes. People's interests and career paths are diverse, and we shouldn't make assumptions based solely on personality sketches.
