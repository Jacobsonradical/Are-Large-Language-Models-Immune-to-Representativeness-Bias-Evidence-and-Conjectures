Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits aren't exclusive to any field, they might be slightly less common in a typical business administration program compared to others. 
* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding of abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with success in computer science.  The quiet nature also aligns with some stereotypes of the field.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Many individuals in business administration possess the traits described, and many computer science students might not fit this personality sketch.  It's crucial to avoid overgeneralizing based on limited information.
