Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and a very limited sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The description emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. However, the strong connection to nature and empathy could suggest other interests. 
* **Business Administration:** This profile aligns less strongly with common perceptions of business administration students. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the emphasis on nature and empathy might be less common.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and potential stereotypes.  People are diverse, and many individuals in these fields may not fit the typical mold.
