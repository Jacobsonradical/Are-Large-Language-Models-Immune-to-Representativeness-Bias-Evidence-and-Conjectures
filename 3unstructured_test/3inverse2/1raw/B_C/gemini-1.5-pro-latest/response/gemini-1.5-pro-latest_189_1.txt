Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  However, there's no direct mention of technology or coding, which are strong indicators of an interest in computer science. Hence, the probability is moderate. 

* **Business Administration:** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business. While understanding hard work and dedication is valuable in business, the other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of the stereotype of a business student. Therefore, the probability is lower. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. People's interests are diverse, and this sketch could describe individuals in many different fields.
