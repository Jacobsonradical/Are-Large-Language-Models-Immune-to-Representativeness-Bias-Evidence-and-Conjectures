Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is speculative and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ all traits associated with computer science. However, the strong focus on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence is valuable in business, the personality sketch emphasizes traits not always stereotypically associated with business administration (love for animals, quiet demeanor).  

**Important Notes:**

* **Individual Variation:**  Personalities within any field are diverse. Many computer scientists love nature, and many businesspeople are deeply empathetic. 
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality but lacks details about his specific interests within each field (e.g., AI ethics vs. financial modeling).
* **Stereotypes:**  These estimations are based on general perceptions of these fields and shouldn't be taken as definitive judgments about individuals.
