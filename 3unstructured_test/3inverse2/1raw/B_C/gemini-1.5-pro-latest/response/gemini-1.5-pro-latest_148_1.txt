Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields.  
* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights problem-solving, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, which are often associated with computer science students.  

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative. There are many compassionate and nature-loving individuals in business, just as there are many in computer science who might not fit this description. This exercise relies heavily on general perceptions of these fields.
