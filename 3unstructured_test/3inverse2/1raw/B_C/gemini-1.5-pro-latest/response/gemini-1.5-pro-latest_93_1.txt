Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided is very limited:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The description doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the emphasis on nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts leans away from a typical business student profile.
* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, intelligence) align well with common perceptions of computer science students. This makes it somewhat more likely, but not definitive. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general associations and don't reflect the full diversity within each field.  Many people in business administration are deeply empathetic, and many computer scientists are passionate about nature.
* **Limited Information:** We know very little about Adam beyond this sketch. His specific interests within each field, his undergraduate background, and other factors could significantly influence the actual probabilities.
