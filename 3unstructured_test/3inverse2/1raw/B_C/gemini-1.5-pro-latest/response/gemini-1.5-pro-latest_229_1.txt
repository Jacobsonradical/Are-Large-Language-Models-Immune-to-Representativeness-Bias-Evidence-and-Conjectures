Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence. These traits are strongly associated with computer science fields. While not exclusive to CS, the combination makes it a more likely fit than business administration.

* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):**  The sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business-oriented personalities.  Words like "leadership," "ambition," "negotiation," or a focus on financial systems would strengthen the case for business administration. While someone with the described traits could certainly succeed in business, it's not the most immediate or obvious fit based on the provided information. 
 
**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information. A personality sketch alone cannot definitively determine someone's field of study. Many other factors (interests, experiences, opportunities) influence academic choices.
