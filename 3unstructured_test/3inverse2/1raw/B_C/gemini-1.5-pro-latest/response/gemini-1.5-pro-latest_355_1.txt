Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes associated with the fields and the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights intelligence, problem-solving skills, and an understanding of abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with those drawn to computer science. The quiet nature and love for nature could also fit the image of someone who enjoys the more solitary and analytical aspects of the field.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and potential stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration possess the traits described, and many computer science students might not fit this profile.  Personality is complex, and field of study is just one small facet.
