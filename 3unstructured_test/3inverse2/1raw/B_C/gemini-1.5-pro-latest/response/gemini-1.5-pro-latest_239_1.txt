Here's an attempt to quantify the probabilities based on the provided sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and potentially abstract concepts. These traits are not as strongly associated with typical business administration students.
* **Computer Science:**  The sketch highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and potentially abstract thinking. These are all traits frequently found in computer science students.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Subjective Assessment:** These probabilities are highly subjective. The sketch provides some clues, but there's a lot of room for interpretation. 
* **Stereotypes:** My reasoning relies on some general stereotypes about different fields, which may not always hold true.  
* **Individual Variation:**  People are diverse! There are plenty of nature-loving business students and empathetic computer scientists. This sketch doesn't provide enough information for a definitive answer.
