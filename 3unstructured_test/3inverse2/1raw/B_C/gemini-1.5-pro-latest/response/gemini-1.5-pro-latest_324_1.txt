Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and a short sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Puzzles relate to problem-solving, and abstract thinking is key in programming. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical in a computer science stereotype.
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality sketch's focus on nature, animals, and empathy doesn't strongly align with the common perception of a business administration student. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities rely on general perceptions of these fields.  Many individuals in computer science and business administration defy these stereotypes.
* **Limited Information:** The personality sketch is brief.  More details about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would dramatically change the probability estimates.
