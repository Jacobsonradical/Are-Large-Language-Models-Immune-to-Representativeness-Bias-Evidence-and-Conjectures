Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Puzzles relate to problem-solving, and abstract thinking is key in programming. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy is less stereotypical. 
* **Business Administration:**  The personality sketch is less typical of a business administration student.  While intelligence and hard work are valued, the focus on nature, animals, and quiet contemplation is less common in that field. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities rely on broad generalizations. Many individuals in computer science are deeply empathetic and nature-loving, just as there are compassionate and introspective individuals in business.
* **Individual Variation:** Personalities within any field are incredibly diverse. 
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a narrow view of Adam. His other interests, experiences, and goals would significantly influence his field of study.
