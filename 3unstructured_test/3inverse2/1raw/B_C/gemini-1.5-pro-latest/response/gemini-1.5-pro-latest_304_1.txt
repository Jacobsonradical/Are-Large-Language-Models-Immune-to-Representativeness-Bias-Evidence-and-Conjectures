Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for someone in a science or nature-related field. 
* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving â€“ traits often associated with computer science. The connection to nature might be less common but isn't unheard of.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities rely heavily on stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic, and many computer scientists are passionate about nature.
* **Individual Variation:** Personalities within any field are incredibly diverse. 
* **Limited Information:**  The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality but lacks crucial details about his aspirations, specific interests within his field, and other factors that could influence his career choice.
