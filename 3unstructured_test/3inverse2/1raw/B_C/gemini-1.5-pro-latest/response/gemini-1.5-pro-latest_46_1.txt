Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are just educated guesses based on stereotypes and the provided description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, intelligence, and abstract thinking â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. However, the strong nature connection might be considered less typical. Hence, a moderate probability. 
* **Business Administration:**  The personality sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, ambition, or a focus on finance/economics. The emphasis on empathy and nature might even be seen as less common in this field. Therefore, a lower probability.

**Important Notes:**

* **Individual Variation:**  Personality traits within any field are diverse.  These probabilities are based on general perceptions and not absolute rules.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality but lacks details about his specific interests within each field, which could significantly influence his actual field of study.
