Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based purely on a personality sketch and is inherently subjective:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) are often associated with individuals drawn to computer science. This field can attract people who enjoy understanding complex systems, similar to how one might be fascinated by the intricacies of nature. 
* **Business Administration:** While some aspects like hard work and dedication are relevant to business, the sketch lacks a strong emphasis on leadership, ambition, or financial drive â€“ qualities often associated with business students. The love for nature and animals might be seen as less common in this field, though certainly not impossible.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches offer very limited information.  Many individuals in business administration could possess these traits, and many computer science students might not fit this description. This assessment is for probabilistic fun and shouldn't be taken as a definitive judgment.
