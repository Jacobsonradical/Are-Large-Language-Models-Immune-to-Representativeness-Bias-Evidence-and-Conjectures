Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and lacks concrete data:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some traits (hard work, intelligence) are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and puzzle-solving. These aren't as stereotypical in a business context.
* **Computer Science:**  The sketch's emphasis on puzzles and abstract thinking aligns well with computer science.  However, the strong nature focus might be seen as less common in this field.

**Important Notes:**

* **Overlap:**  Many personality types succeed in both fields. This is a probability estimate, not a definitive judgment.
* **Individual Variation:** Adam could easily defy these probabilities. There are nature-loving business people and deeply empathetic computer scientists!
* **Sketch Limitations:** The sketch is brief.  More details about Adam's passions, hobbies, or experiences would greatly alter the probabilities.
