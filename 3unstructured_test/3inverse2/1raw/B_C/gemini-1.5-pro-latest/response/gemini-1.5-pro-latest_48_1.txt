Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (intelligence, hard work) are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and a love for animals. These traits are not as stereotypical for someone drawn to the business world.
* **Computer Science:**  The description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with common perceptions of individuals interested in computer science.  

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes.  Individual personalities within any field are incredibly diverse.
