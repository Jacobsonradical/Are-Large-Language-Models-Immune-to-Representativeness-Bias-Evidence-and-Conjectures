Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes a love for nature and animals, which might be less common motivators in that field.  

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration share the described traits, and many computer science students might not.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study.
