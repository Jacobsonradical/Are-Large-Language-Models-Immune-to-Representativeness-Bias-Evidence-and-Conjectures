Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While someone with Adam's traits could certainly go into business, the sketch emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts. These aren't stereotypical qualities emphasized in business programs. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description of Adam enjoying puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts aligns well with common perceptions of computer science students. His intelligence would also be an asset in this field.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and potential stereotypes.  People's personalities and career choices are far more complex and varied than any sketch can capture.
