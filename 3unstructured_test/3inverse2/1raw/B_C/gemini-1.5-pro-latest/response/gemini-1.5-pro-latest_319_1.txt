Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is far from definitive:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) are strongly associated with computer science stereotypes. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, the sketch emphasizes nature and animal love, which are less typical interests for business students.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study. There are plenty of nature-loving, empathetic individuals in business and many puzzle-solving computer scientists who may not be as interested in nature.
