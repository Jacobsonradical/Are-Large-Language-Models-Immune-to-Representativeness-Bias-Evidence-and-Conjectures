Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits are present in the business world, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description of being a "quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" aligns more strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just probabilities based on limited information. There are many compassionate and nature-loving individuals in business administration. Similarly, many computer science students have diverse interests beyond the stereotypes.
* The actual probability would be heavily influenced by additional factors like Adam's specific interests within each field, his upbringing, and personal experiences.
