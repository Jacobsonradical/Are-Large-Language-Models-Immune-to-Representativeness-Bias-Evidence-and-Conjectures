Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence are common traits. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals is less typical. 
* **Business Administration:**  The profile doesn't strongly suggest a business administration student. While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, they aren't specific indicators. The other traits (love of nature, puzzles, abstract thinking) are less commonly associated with this field.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong stereotyping.  Many individuals in computer science are deeply connected to nature, and many in business have strong empathy.  These probabilities are simply based on general perceptions and limited information.
