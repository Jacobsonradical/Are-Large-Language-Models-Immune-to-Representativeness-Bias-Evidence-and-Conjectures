Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (intelligence, hard work) are valuable in business, the description leans towards an interest in nature, empathy, and potentially abstract concepts. These are less stereotypical of someone drawn to business administration.
* **Computer Science:**  The profile aligns more strongly with a computer science student.  Problem-solving, abstract thinking, and a love for puzzles are often associated with those in computer science fields.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on generalized assumptions. Many individuals in business possess the traits described, and many in computer science might not. 
* **Individuality:**  People are diverse! This sketch doesn't capture the full complexity of a person, and Adam's actual interests could easily lie elsewhere.
