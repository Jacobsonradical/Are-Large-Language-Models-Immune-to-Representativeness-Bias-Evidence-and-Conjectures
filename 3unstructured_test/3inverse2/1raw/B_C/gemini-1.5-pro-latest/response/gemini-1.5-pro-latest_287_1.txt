Here's an estimated probability breakdown, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes abstract thinking, puzzle-solving, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. His love for nature might be less common but doesn't preclude him from the field.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing.  

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration might share the described traits, and many computer science students might not.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study.
