Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this, along with the estimated probabilities:

**Reasoning:**

* **The Sketch:** The personality sketch leans towards someone who is analytical (puzzle-solving, understanding abstract concepts), empathetic, and drawn to nature.
* **Computer Science:** These traits are fairly common among computer science students.  Analytical thinking is fundamental to programming, and many in the field have diverse interests, including nature.
* **Business Administration:** While business administration requires analytical skills, the emphasis on empathy and a love for nature is less common compared to computer science.

**Probabilities:**

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on general stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field vary greatly.
