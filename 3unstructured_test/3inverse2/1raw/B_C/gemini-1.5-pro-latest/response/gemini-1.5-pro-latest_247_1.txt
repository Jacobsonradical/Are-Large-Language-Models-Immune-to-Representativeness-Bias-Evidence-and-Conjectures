Here's a breakdown of how we can assess the probabilities, keeping in mind this is subjective:

**Personality Traits and Stereotypes:**

* **Nature, Animals, Empathy:** These traits are not strongly associated with business or computer science stereotypes. 
* **Puzzles, Abstract Concepts, Intelligence:** These fit well with computer science, and to a lesser extent, quantitative business fields.
* **Hard Work/Dedication:** Applicable to almost any field.

**Base Rates:**

* It's important to consider how common these fields are among graduate students.  Computer science is a popular graduate degree, while business administration might be even more so (MBA programs are large).

**Probability Estimates:**

Since the personality sketch leans slightly towards computer science due to the problem-solving and abstract thinking, the probability of it describing Adam would be slightly lower if he were in business administration.  

Here's a possible representation:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative. Realistically, this personality sketch is too general to provide strong evidence for or against either field.
