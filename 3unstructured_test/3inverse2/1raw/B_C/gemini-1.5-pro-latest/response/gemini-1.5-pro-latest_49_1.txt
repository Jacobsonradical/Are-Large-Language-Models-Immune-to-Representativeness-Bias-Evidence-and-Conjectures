Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits aren't exclusive to any field, they might be considered less typical for someone drawn to the competitive and often financially driven world of business administration. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description highlights puzzle-solving abilities, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with individuals drawn to computer science. The connection to nature and animals is less strong here, but it's certainly possible for someone in computer science to have these interests.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities are based on general perceptions of these fields.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic, and many computer scientists have a profound love for nature.
* **Individual Variation:**  People are complex, and a personality sketch provides a very limited view. There's a wide range of personalities within every field. 
* **Limited Information:** We know very little about Adam beyond this sketch and his graduate school status in 2021.
