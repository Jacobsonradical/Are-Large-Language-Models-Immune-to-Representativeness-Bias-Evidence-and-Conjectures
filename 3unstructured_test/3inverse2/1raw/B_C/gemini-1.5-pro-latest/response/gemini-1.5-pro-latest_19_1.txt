Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose guidelines based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The description emphasizes empathy, warmth, and appreciation for hard work â€“ traits not uncommon in business but not exclusive to it. The love for nature and puzzle-solving could swing either way. 
* **Computer Science:** The emphasis on logic (puzzles), abstract thinking, and intelligence aligns more strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Personality is not destiny:**  These are just probabilities based on vague correlations. Many individuals in business are deeply empathetic, and many computer scientists love nature.
* **Individual Variation:** Adam's specific interests within each field (like environmental business or AI ethics) could drastically change these probabilities.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality, but  factors like upbringing, life experiences, and specific skills are unknown and heavily influence career choices.
