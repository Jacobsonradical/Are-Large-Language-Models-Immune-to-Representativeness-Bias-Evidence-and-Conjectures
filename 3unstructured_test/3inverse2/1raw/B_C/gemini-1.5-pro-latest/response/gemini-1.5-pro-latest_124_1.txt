Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (intelligence, hard work) are valuable in business, the description emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking, which are not as stereotypical in a business context. 
* **Computer Science:** The description aligns more strongly with common perceptions of computer science students: puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and a potential interest in systems (relatable to nature's complexity).

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and not on any definitive data. Many individuals in business administration could easily fit the description, and many computer science students might not.
* **Individual Variation:**  Personality is highly individual. Adam's specific interests within his chosen field could heavily influence whether this description fits him.
