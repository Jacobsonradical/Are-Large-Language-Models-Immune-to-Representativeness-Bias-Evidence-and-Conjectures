Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving skills, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence. These traits are highly compatible with computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals might be slightly less common in computer science students, though certainly not absent.  
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch highlights empathy, understanding hard work, and a warm heart. These are valuable traits in business, but the core interests (nature, animals, puzzles) seem less directly aligned with a typical business administration focus. 

**Important Note:** These are just rough estimates based on stereotypes.  People's personalities and interests are diverse, and many individuals in computer science or business administration could easily fit the provided description.
