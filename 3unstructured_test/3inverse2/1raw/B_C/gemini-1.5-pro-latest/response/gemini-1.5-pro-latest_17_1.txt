Here's my attempt at estimating the probabilities, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat with a computer science student. Problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, and even an interest in nature (bioinformatics exists!) are relevant. However, there's nothing particularly strong pointing towards CS.
* **Business Administration:**  The profile doesn't strongly suggest a typical business student. While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, they aren't exclusive to it. The description lacks common business-oriented traits (ambition, leadership, risk-taking, etc.).

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are heavily influenced by common stereotypes about each field. Reality is far more diverse. 
* **Individual Variation:**  Personalities within any field vary drastically. Many computer science students love nature, and many business students are deeply empathetic.
* **Limited Information:** The personality sketch is brief. More information about Adam's skills, interests, and goals would dramatically change the probability estimates.
