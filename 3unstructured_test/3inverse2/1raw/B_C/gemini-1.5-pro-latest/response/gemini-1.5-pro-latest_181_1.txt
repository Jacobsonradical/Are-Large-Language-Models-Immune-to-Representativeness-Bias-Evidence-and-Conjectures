Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. Thus, the probability is moderate. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business administration, the sketch's focus on nature, empathy, and animals doesn't strongly suggest this field. Hence, the probability is lower.

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on general stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field vary greatly.  A personality sketch alone cannot reliably predict someone's field of study.
