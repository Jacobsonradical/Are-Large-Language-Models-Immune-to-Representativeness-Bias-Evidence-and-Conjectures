Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information given is very limited:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the emphasis on nature, animals, and abstract concepts might be less common in a typical business student. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description aligns more with a computer science student stereotype: enjoying puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and potentially having an analytical mind. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to recognize that these are very rough estimates based on limited information and common stereotypes.  Personality is complex, and many individuals in business fields share the described traits, just as many computer science students might not.
