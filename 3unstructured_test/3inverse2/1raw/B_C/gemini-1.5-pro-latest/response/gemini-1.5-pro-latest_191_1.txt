Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes a love for nature and animals, which might be less common motivators in that field. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration share the described traits, and many computer science students might not.  Personality sketches offer limited information, and it's impossible to definitively determine someone's field of study based on them.
