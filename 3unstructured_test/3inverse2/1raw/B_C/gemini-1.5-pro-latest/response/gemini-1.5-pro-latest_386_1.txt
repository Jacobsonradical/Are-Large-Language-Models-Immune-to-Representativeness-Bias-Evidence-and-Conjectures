Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based purely on personality stereotypes and the sketch provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding of abstract concepts â€“ all traits often associated with computer science students.  However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be considered less typical, lowering the probability somewhat. 

* **Business Administration:**  The sketch doesn't strongly align with typical stereotypes of business administration students. While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals doesn't particularly suggest an inclination towards this field.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to emphasize that these are just probabilities based on limited information and stereotypes.  Many individuals in computer science and business administration possess the traits described in the sketch, and conversely, people with these traits may be drawn to a wide range of fields.
