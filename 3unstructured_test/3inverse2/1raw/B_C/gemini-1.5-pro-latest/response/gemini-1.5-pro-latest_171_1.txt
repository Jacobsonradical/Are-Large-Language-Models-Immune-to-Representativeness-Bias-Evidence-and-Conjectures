Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving â€“ all traits commonly associated with computer science. This makes it somewhat likely, hence the 0.4 probability.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business, the sketch emphasizes empathy, love for nature, and understanding of dedication. These traits are not as strongly stereotypical of business administration students, making it less likely compared to computer science. Hence, a lower probability of 0.2.

**Important Note:** These are just rough estimates based on common stereotypes.  Personality sketches are not definitive indicators of someone's field of study.  Many other factors (personal interests, career goals, financial considerations, etc.) influence a person's choice of graduate program.
