Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch mentions enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts - all traits commonly associated with computer science students. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence is important in business, the personality sketch doesn't strongly align with common stereotypes of business students (e.g., focus on competition, ambition, financial success). The love for nature and animals might be seen as less common in this field.

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly subjective and based on limited information. 
* Many individuals in computer science and business administration possess a wide range of interests and personality traits. 
* It's crucial to avoid making assumptions about individuals based solely on their field of study.
