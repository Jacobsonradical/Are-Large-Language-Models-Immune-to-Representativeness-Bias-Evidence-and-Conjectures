Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose guidelines based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The personality sketch aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  The love for puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are common traits in this field. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical. 
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch aligns less strongly with a typical business administration student. The focus on nature, empathy, and potentially less on competitiveness or direct financial drive makes it seem less likely.

**Important Note:**  These are very weak correlations.  Personality is not a strong predictor of academic field, and many individuals in both computer science and business administration possess the traits described.
