Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (intelligence, hard work) are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking. These aren't as stereotypical in a business context.
* **Computer Science:**  The emphasis on puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence aligns well with common perceptions of computer science students. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general assumptions. Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic, and many computer scientists are passionate about nature.
* **Individual Variation:** Personality is complex, and a sketch can't fully capture an individual. 
* **Limited Information:** We know very little about Adam's specific interests within each field.
