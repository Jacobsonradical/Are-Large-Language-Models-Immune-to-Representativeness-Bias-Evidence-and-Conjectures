Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided doesn't definitively place Adam in any field:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The description emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields.
* **Computer Science:**  The sketch highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and a curiosity about nature (which can relate to systems thinking). These strongly align with common perceptions of computer science students.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not definitive. Many individuals in business administration could easily fit the described profile, and many computer science students might not. This assessment is based purely on probabilities derived from common stereotypes associated with these fields.
