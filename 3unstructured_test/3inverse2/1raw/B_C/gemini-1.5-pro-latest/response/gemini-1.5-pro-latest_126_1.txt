Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The personality sketch aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence are common traits in that field. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be slightly less common. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the other traits (love for animals, curiosity about nature) are less typical of the stereotype of a business administration student.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study. Many individuals in computer science share the described traits, and many in business administration may have unexpected passions.
