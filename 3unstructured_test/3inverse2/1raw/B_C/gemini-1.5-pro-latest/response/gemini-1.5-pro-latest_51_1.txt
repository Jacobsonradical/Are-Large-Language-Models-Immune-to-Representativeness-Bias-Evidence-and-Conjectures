Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and a very limited personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The profile mentions enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, all of which are commonly associated with computer science students. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical, lowering the probability slightly. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality description leans more towards interests and traits not as strongly associated with a typical business administration student. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to understand that these are just rough estimates based on limited information and common stereotypes.  People's personalities and career choices are far more complex and varied than simple generalizations.
