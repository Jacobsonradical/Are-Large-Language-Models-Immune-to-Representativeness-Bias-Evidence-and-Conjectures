Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes the personality sketch might evoke:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence. These are often associated with computer science students, making the probability higher.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business, the sketch's focus on nature, empathy, and a quiet demeanor aligns less strongly with the common perception of business students.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities rely on general perceptions of these fields. Many individuals in business are deeply empathetic, and many computer scientists are passionate about nature.
* **Individual Variation:**  Personality is highly individual. There are many quiet, nature-loving individuals in both fields. 

This exercise highlights how personality sketches can suggest fields but are not definitive predictors of someone's actual area of study.
