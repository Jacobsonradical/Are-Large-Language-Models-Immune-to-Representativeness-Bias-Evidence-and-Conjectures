Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, intelligence, abstract thinking - traits often associated with computer science students.  The love of nature and animals isn't exclusive to any field but doesn't contradict this likelihood. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the profile emphasizes empathy and a love for nature, which are less typical (though not unheard of) as primary motivators in this field. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are speculative. People are diverse, and many individuals in business administration could easily fit the description, just as many computer science students might not.
