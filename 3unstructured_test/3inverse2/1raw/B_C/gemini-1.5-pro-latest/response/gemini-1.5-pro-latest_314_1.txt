Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is not definitive:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The sketch leans towards interests often associated with STEM fields:** Curiosity about nature, puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and appreciation for hard work fit stereotypes of individuals drawn to science or technology.

* **Computer Science Alignment:**  These traits are particularly common stereotypes about computer scientists.

* **Business Administration is less likely:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests (finance, leadership, marketing). 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are incredibly weak predictors of someone's field of study.  Many individuals in business administration could have these traits, and many computer science students might not. This exercise is about probabilities based on limited information, not accurate profiling.
