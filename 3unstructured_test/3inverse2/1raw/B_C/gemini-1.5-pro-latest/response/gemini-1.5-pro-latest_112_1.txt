Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is purely speculative based on stereotypes associated with the fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description highlights puzzle-solving skills and understanding abstract concepts, traits often associated with computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality sketch emphasizes traits (love for animals, curiosity about nature) not as strongly associated with the field.

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on general perceptions.  Individual personalities within any field vary greatly.  It's entirely possible for someone with the described traits to thrive in either computer science or business administration.
