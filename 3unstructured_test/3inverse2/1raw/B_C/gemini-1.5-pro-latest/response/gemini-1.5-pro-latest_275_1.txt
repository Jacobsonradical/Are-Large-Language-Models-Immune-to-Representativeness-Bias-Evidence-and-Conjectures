Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information given could describe someone in many fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes abstract thinking and puzzle-solving, traits often associated with computer science. However, the strong connection to nature and empathy for animals might be seen as less typical for this field.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence is valuable in business, the personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a drive for the competitive or financial aspects often associated with business administration.  

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes.  People's personalities and career choices are far more complex than simple sketches can capture.
