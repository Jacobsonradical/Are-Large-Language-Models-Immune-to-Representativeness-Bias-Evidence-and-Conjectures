Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose guidelines based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (hard work, intelligence) are valued in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking â€“ not stereotypical business focuses. It's possible, but less likely.
* **Computer Science:**  The puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence align well with common perceptions of computer science students. This makes it more likely, though not guaranteed.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  These estimations are based on broad generalizations. Many individuals in business are deeply empathetic, and many in computer science are passionate about nature.
* **Individual Variation:**  Even if statistically more likely to be in computer science, Adam's specific interests (what kind of puzzles, what aspects of nature) could easily swing him towards or away from either field.
* **Missing Information:**  Knowing Adam's undergraduate major, hobbies, or career goals would drastically improve the accuracy of this estimation.
