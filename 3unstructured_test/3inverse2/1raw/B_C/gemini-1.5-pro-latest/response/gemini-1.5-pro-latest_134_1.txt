Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns moderately well with a computer science student.  
    * **Strengths:** Enjoyment of puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators of a computer science aptitude. 
    * **Neutral:** Curiosity about nature and love for animals aren't particularly strong indicators either way.
    * **Weakness:** While not unheard of, a "quiet" and deeply empathetic personality might be slightly less common in the stereotypical view of computer science students.

* **Business Administration:** The description aligns less strongly with a typical business administration student.
    * **Strengths:**  Appreciation for hard work and dedication is positive, but not exclusive to business.
    * **Neutral:**  Intelligence is valuable in business, but the description doesn't highlight traits like leadership or ambition often associated with the field. 
    * **Weaknesses:** The strong emphasis on nature, animals, and quiet problem-solving doesn't fit the common image of someone drawn to the fast-paced, often people-oriented world of business. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and don't account for the diversity within each field.  Many exceptions exist!
* **Limited Information:** The personality sketch is brief. More details about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would lead to a more accurate assessment.
