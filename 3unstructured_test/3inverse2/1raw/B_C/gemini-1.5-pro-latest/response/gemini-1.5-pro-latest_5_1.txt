Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned - puzzle solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts - align strongly with the common perception of individuals drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes a love for nature and animals, which are not as directly relevant to the field.  

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective exercise. Personality sketches can offer hints, but they are not reliable predictors of a person's field of study. Many individuals with these traits could be found in business administration, and many computer science students might not fit this description.
