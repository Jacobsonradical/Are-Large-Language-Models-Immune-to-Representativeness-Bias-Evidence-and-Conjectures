Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose estimations based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch mentions enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, all of which are commonly associated with computer science. This lowers the probability compared to business administration. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature, empathy, and love for animals doesn't strongly align with typical business administration stereotypes. This increases the probability compared to computer science.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These estimations are based on very general stereotypes and don't reflect the full diversity of individuals within these fields. 
* **Individual Variation:**  People's personalities are complex, and many individuals in both fields wouldn't fit these stereotypes.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides limited information about Adam's specific interests and skills, making it difficult to give highly accurate probabilities.
