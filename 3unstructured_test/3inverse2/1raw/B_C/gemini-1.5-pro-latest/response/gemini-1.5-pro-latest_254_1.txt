Here's an estimated probability based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science. However, the strong connection to nature and animals might be less common in this field. 
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch lacks typical markers associated with business administration, such as leadership, ambition, strong communication, or interest in finance/markets. The emphasis on empathy and nature further lowers the likelihood.

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly subjective and based on general stereotypes. There's a wide range of personalities within every field.
* The personality sketch provides limited information.  Knowing Adam's hobbies, specific interests within his field, or other details would significantly impact the probability estimates.
