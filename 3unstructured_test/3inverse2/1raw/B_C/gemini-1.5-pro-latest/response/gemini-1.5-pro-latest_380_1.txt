Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, quietness, puzzle-solving, and abstract thought. These traits are less typical markers of aspiring business professionals. 
* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thought, high intelligence) align strongly with the skills and interests of many computer science students. This makes it more likely, but not guaranteed, that the sketch describes a computer science student.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches offer limited information. Many individuals in both fields could possess these traits. These probabilities are simply based on the relative likelihood given the described characteristics.
