Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is open to interpretation:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The sketch mentions enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. These traits are often associated with computer science students. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical, lowering the probability. 
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While "hard work and dedication" could apply, there's nothing about leadership, ambition, or financial interest that we might associate with business students. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities rely on general perceptions of these fields. Many individuals in computer science and business administration wouldn't fit these stereotypes.
* **Individuality:** The sketch provides a limited view of a complex person. Adam's specific interests within these fields could significantly alter the probabilities. 

**Ultimately, without more information about Adam's specific skills and passions, it's impossible to give definitive probabilities.**
