Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) strongly align with skills and interests common in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature, animals, and potentially solitary pursuits (puzzles) makes it seem less likely for a business administration student.

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective assessment based on stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration may share the described traits, just as some computer science students may not.  These probabilities are simply estimations based on the provided information.
