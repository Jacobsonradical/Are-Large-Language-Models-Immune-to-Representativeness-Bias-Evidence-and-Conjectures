Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose guidelines based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The description leans towards interests often associated with scientific or nature-related fields. While someone in business administration can certainly have these traits, they might be considered less typical. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description highlights puzzle-solving skills, abstract thinking, and intelligence, which are often associated with computer science. The love for nature and animals doesn't contradict this and could be seen as common in individuals with diverse interests.

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality isn't destiny:**  Personality sketches offer very limited insight into a person's actual field of study. People's interests and career choices are far more complex.
* **Stereotypes are misleading:** We're relying on general perceptions of these fields, which are often inaccurate when applied to individuals.
* **Graduate student demographics vary:** The prevalence of certain personality traits within graduate programs can fluctuate. 

**It's impossible to give a precise probability without more information about Adam and the graduate programs in question.**
