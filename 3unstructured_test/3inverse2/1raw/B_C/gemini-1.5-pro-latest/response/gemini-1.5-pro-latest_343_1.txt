Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. However, the strong connection to nature and empathy might be seen as less typical. Thus, the probability is moderate.

* **Business Administration:** This field is often associated with ambition, leadership, and a focus on financial success. While the sketch doesn't directly contradict these traits, it emphasizes different aspects like empathy and love for animals, which are not as stereotypical. Therefore, the probability is lower. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities rely heavily on general perceptions of these fields.  Individual students within any field vary greatly.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a narrow view of Adam's personality. Other interests, skills, and experiences could significantly influence his field of study. 
* **Graduate Level:** At the graduate level, students are often more specialized and driven by specific research interests, making it even harder to guess based on a general personality sketch.
