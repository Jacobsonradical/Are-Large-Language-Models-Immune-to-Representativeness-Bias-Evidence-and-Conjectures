Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The sketch highlights traits often associated with those drawn to computer science: puzzle-solving aptitude, comfort with abstract concepts, and high intelligence.  This makes the probability higher than business administration.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes a love for nature and animals, which are less directly relevant to traditional business pursuits. This suggests a lower probability compared to computer science.

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are subjective and based on stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field are diverse.
* The sketch provides limited information.  Other factors (e.g., Adam's upbringing, socioeconomic background) could significantly influence his field of study.
