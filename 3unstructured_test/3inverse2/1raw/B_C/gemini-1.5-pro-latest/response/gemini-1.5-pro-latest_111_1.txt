Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) strongly align with common perceptions of individuals drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the description leans more heavily towards interests often associated with science or nature-related fields.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment. Personality sketches offer limited information, and many individuals in business administration possess the described traits.  These probabilities are simply estimations based on general stereotypes and should not be interpreted as definitive judgments about individuals in these fields.
