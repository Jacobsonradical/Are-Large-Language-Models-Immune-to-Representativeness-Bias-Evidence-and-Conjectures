Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The description highlights intelligence, problem-solving, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ all traits commonly associated with computer science students. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence is valuable in business, the personality sketch doesn't strongly align with common stereotypes of business students (e.g., focus on ambition, competition, financial drive). The love of nature and animals might be seen as less common in this field.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  People's personalities and interests are diverse, and there are individuals who defy stereotypes in every field.
