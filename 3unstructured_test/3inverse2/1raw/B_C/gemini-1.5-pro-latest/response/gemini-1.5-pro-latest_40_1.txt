Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (intelligence, work ethic) are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking. These aren't as strongly associated with typical business student stereotypes. 
* **Computer Science:**  The puzzle-solving aptitude, abstract thinking, and intelligence align well with common perceptions of computer science students. The love for animals and nature might be less common but not unheard of. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid strong generalizations.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic, and many computer scientists are passionate about nature. This assessment is based on probabilistic tendencies, not absolute rules.
