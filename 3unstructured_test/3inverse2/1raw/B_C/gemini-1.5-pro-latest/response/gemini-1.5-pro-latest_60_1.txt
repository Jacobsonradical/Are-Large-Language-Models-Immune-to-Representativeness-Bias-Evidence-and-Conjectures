Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and general stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving, all traits often associated with computer science students. This makes the probability moderate. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence is valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes empathy, love for nature, and appreciation for hard work. These traits are not as stereotypical for business administration students, making the probability slightly higher that the sketch is NOT about someone in that field.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches provide very limited information, and people's interests and career choices are complex.
