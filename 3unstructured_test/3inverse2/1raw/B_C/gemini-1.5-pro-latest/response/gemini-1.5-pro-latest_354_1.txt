Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy, understanding hard work, and a love for nature. While some business students possess these traits, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description highlights problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence - traits often associated with computer science students. The love for nature and animals is less common but not unheard of in this field. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on very general perceptions and should not be taken as definitive. Many individuals in business administration possess the traits described, and many computer science students might not.  Personality is complex and varies greatly within any field of study.
