Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  However, the strong nature focus might be considered less typical. Thus, the probability is moderate but not extremely high. 
* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, a warm heart, and appreciation for hard work. These are valuable traits in any field, but they are not as stereotypical of business administration students as they might be for fields involving more direct interaction with people or nature.  Hence, the probability is lower. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just estimates based on general perceptions. Individual personalities within any field vary greatly.
*  A real analysis would require a much larger sample size and more data points to be statistically significant.
