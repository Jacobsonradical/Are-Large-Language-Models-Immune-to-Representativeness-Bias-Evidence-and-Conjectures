Here's my attempt to quantify the likelihoods based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with business students, such as an interest in economics, leadership, or interpersonal communication.

**Important Notes:**

* **Subjective Nature:** This assessment is highly subjective. Personality sketches are not definitive predictors of a person's field of study.  
* **Individual Variation:**  There's significant variation within any field. Many business students could fit the sketch, and many computer science students might not.
* **Missing Information:** Knowing Adam's undergraduate major, hobbies, or other interests would drastically alter the probabilities.

This exercise highlights how stereotypes and limited information can influence our judgments.
