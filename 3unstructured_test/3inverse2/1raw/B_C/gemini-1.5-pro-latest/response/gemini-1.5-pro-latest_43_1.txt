Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is purely speculative based on stereotypes associated with the fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat well with a computer science student.  Puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence are common traits. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as slightly less typical.
* **Business Administration:** The profile doesn't strongly suggest a business administration student.  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the focus on nature, empathy, and animals seems less aligned with the common perception of this field.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly subjective.  Many individuals in computer science or business administration possess the traits described. This assessment relies on general stereotypes and shouldn't be interpreted as a definitive judgment about individuals in these fields.
