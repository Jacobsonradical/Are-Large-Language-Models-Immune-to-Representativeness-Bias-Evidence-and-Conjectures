Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat with a computer science student. Problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence are common traits. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy is less typical. 
* **Business Administration:**  The personality sketch is less typical of a business administration student. Business programs often attract individuals interested in leadership, management, and finance. While intelligence and hard work are valued, the specific traits mentioned (love for animals, nature) are less directly relevant.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Many individuals in computer science or business administration could have the described personality traits. It's crucial to avoid stereotyping based on fields of study.
