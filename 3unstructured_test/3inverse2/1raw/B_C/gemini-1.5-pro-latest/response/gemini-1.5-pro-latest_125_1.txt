Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based purely on a personality sketch and some very general stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ all traits commonly associated with computer science. While not a perfect predictor, these attributes suggest a slightly higher likelihood. 
* **Business Administration:** The sketch doesn't strongly align with typical stereotypes of business administration students. While empathy and hard work are valuable in business, the focus on nature, animals, and potentially solitary pursuits (puzzles) suggests a lower probability. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and not definitive indicators of a person's field of study.  
* **Individual Variation:**  Plenty of computer science students love nature, and many business students are deeply empathetic.  
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality but lacks information about his specific skills, career goals, or other interests that might influence his field of study.
