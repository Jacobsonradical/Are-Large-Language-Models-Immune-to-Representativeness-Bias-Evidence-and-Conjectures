Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes abstract thinking, puzzle-solving, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. This suggests a higher probability. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests (e.g., leadership, finance, marketing). The emphasis on nature and animals might be seen as less common in this field.

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic choices. 
* Many individuals in business administration possess the traits described, and many computer science students might not fit this profile. 
* Adam's actual field could be something completely different, and his personality could align with or contradict stereotypes associated with it.
