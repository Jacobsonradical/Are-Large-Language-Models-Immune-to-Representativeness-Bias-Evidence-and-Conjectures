Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (hard work, intelligence) are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking. These aren't as strong indicators of a business administration student. 
* **Computer Science:** The sketch's emphasis on puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence aligns well with the common perception of computer science students.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** My reasoning relies on general associations with these fields. Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic, and many computer science students are passionate about nature. 
* **Limited Information:**  The sketch provides a narrow glimpse into Adam's personality. Other interests, experiences, and skills would significantly influence his actual field of study.
