Here's an interpretation of the personality sketch and the probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The sketch emphasizes curiosity, problem-solving, abstract thinking, and appreciation for hard work.** These traits are found in individuals across many fields, including both business and computer science.
* **The strong emphasis on nature, plants, and animals might suggest a slight bias against a purely business-oriented personality.**  While someone in business can certainly have these interests, they are perhaps more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. 
* **The puzzle-solving aspect and comfort with abstract concepts align well with computer science.**

**Important Notes:**

* **These probabilities are highly subjective.**  Personality sketches provide limited information, and many individuals in business administration could easily fit the described traits (and vice-versa). 
* **The base rates of graduate students in each field would also influence real-world probabilities.** In 2021, there were likely far more graduate students in business administration than in specialized fields related to the nature-focused aspects of the sketch. This would increase the probability of the subject being in business administration if we had no other information.

**In conclusion:** While the personality sketch leans slightly towards computer science, it's crucial to remember that it's just a sketch. A multitude of other factors would be needed to make a confident prediction about Adam's field of study.
