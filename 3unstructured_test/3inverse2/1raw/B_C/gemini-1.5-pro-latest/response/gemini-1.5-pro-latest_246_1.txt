**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch describes someone who enjoys problem-solving, abstract concepts, and has empathy. These traits are often found in individuals pursuing both computer science and fields where understanding people is crucial, like business administration.  

* **Computer Science:** The love for puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. However, the emphasis on nature and animals might be slightly less common in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the description doesn't strongly suggest a business-oriented personality. The emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy might be seen as less typical for someone drawn to the competitive, often fast-paced world of business.

**Therefore, the probability for computer science is slightly lower than business administration, but both remain relatively moderate as the personality sketch doesn't strongly align with either field exclusively.**
