Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is far from definitive:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch aligns well with common perceptions of computer science students:
    * **Puzzle Solving:**  Programming is often seen as puzzle-solving.
    * **Abstract Concepts:** CS requires strong abstract thinking.
    * **Quiet/Introspective:** The stereotype of programmers includes introverted tendencies.

* **Business Administration:** The sketch has some potential overlap but is less strong:
    * **Hard Work/Dedication:** Applicable to business, but not unique.
    * **Intelligence:**  Valuable in business, but not as defining as in CS.
    * **Nature/Animals:** These traits are less typically associated with business.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and could easily be wrong about any individual Adam. 
* **Sketch Ambiguity:** The sketch is open to interpretation. Someone else might see stronger "business" hints we missed.
* **Base Rates:** The prevalence of each field in graduate schools would also influence the actual probability, but we don't have that data.
