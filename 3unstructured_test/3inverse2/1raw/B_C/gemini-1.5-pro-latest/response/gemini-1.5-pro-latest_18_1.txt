Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is suggestive, not definitive:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (Higher Probability):**  The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love of nature might be less common but not unheard of.

* **Business Administration (Lower Probability):**  While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks a strong indication of traits often associated with business students, such as ambition, leadership, or a focus on financial success. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions of these fields. Many individuals in business administration have the traits described, and many computer science students might not.
* **Individual Variation:**  Personality is complex, and Adam's specific interests and goals within each field could change these probabilities significantly. 
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality but doesn't offer insight into his academic or career aspirations.
