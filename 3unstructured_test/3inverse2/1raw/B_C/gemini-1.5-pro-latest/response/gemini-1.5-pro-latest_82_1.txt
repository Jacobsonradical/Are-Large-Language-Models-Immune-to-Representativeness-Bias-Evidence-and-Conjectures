Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with common perceptions of individuals drawn to computer science.  The quiet, nature-loving aspect might be seen as slightly less typical, but not unheard of.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and generalizations.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study. Many individuals in business administration could easily fit the provided description, and many computer science students might not.
