Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights problem-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with computer science.  The quiet nature also aligns with some common perceptions of those in the field.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities rely heavily on common stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic, and many computer scientists are very outgoing.
* **Individual Variation:** People are diverse!  A personality sketch can offer hints, but it's impossible to determine someone's field of study with certainty based on these descriptions.
