Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy, warmth, and understanding hard work - traits valuable in business but not exclusive to it. The lack of explicit mention of things like leadership, ambition, or interest in financial systems makes it less likely.
* **Computer Science:**  The puzzle-solving aptitude, high intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts align well with common perceptions of computer science students.  However, the strong nature focus might be seen as less common in this field. 

**Important Note:** These are very rough estimations.  Many individuals in business administration possess the traits described, and many computer science students are deeply connected to nature.  Personality sketches are not definitive predictors of someone's field of study.
