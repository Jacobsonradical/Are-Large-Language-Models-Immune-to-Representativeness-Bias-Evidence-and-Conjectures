Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (intelligence, hard work) are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and a love for animals. These traits are not as strongly associated with a typical business administration student. 
* **Computer Science:** The description aligns more strongly with a computer science student.  Puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence are often associated with this field.  The quiet and introspective nature hinted at in the sketch also somewhat aligns with common perceptions of computer science students.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on general perceptions. Many individuals in business administration may possess these traits, and many computer science students might not. It's crucial to avoid overgeneralizing.
