Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this problem, along with my estimated probabilities:

**Reasoning**

The personality sketch highlights traits that could be found in individuals across various fields. However, certain traits might be slightly more indicative of one field over another.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence, dedication, and even empathy are valuable in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature, animals, and abstract thought doesn't strongly suggest a typical business administration student. 
* **Computer Science:**  A love for puzzles, abstract thinking, and high intelligence are often associated with computer science. The sketch doesn't contradict a computer science student profile.

**Probabilities**

Based on this reasoning:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly subjective. There's no definitive way to calculate these without a larger dataset of graduate student personalities across different fields.
