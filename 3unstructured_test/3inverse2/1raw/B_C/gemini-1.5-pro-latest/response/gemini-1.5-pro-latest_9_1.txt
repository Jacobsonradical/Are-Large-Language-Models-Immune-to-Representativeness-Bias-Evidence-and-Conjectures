Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on personality stereotypes and not actual data:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch aligns with some common traits of individuals drawn to computer science: problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, and a love for puzzles. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be slightly less common in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality sketch's focus on nature, animals, and empathy doesn't strongly align with the typical image of a business administration student.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic pursuits, and many other factors influence a person's field of study.
