Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is open to interpretation:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits of puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical, though not unheard of, in the field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch emphasizes qualities (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) that are not as strongly associated with the stereotype of a business administration student. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly subjective.  Many individuals in computer science share the described traits, and many in business administration value nature and empathy. This assessment is based on general perceptions and not on any definitive data.
