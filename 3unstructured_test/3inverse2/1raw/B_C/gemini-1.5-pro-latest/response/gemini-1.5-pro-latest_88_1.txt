Here's an estimated probability based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. However, the strong focus on nature and empathy might be seen as less common in this field, hence a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with this field like leadership, ambition, or financial interest. The emphasis on nature and empathy further lowers the likelihood. 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly subjective and based on stereotypes.  Individual personalities within any field are diverse. 
* The information provided is limited.  Real-world probability assessments would require a much larger sample size and more data points.
