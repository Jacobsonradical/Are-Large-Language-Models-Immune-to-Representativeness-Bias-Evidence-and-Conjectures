Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) strongly align with common attributes of individuals drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While some aspects (hard work, dedication) are relevant to business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and animals, which are less typical interests for business students.  

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on general tendencies.  Individual personalities within any field can vary greatly.
