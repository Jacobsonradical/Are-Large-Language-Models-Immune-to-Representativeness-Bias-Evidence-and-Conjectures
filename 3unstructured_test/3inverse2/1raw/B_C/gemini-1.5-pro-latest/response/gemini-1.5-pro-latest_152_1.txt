Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  While the description highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and understanding abstract concepts - all traits found in many computer science students - the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be slightly less common.  It's not impossible, hence the 0.3 probability.
* **Business Administration:** This personality sketch leans more towards someone who might be drawn to fields with a stronger focus on people and animals. The description doesn't strongly suggest the typical drive for the corporate world often associated with business administration. Thus, the probability is higher at 0.6. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on general perceptions. Individual personalities within any field are incredibly diverse.
