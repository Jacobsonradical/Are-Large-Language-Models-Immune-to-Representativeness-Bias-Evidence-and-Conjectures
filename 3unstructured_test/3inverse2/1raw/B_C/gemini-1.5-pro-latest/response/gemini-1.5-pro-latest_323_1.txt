Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided is insufficient for accurate predictions:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't stereotypical of the field.  
* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with computer science. The love of nature and animals is less typical but not unheard of in the field.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and potential biases. Many individuals in business administration possess the traits described, and many computer scientists might not. **Personality sketches should never be used to stereotype or predict career choices.**
