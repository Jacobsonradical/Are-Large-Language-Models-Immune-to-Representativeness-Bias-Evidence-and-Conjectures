Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in business students, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields.
* **Computer Science:** The description highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts â€“ all of which align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. The nature affinity might be less common but doesn't contradict the image. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  People's personalities and interests are diverse, and there's significant overlap between fields. This exercise is more about recognizing potential biases than providing accurate predictions.
