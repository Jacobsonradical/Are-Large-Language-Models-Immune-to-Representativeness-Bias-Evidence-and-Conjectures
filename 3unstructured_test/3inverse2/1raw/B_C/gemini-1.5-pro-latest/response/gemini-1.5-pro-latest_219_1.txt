Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on the provided personality sketch and some stereotypical associations:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes puzzle-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy can be found in business students, the sketch's focus on nature, animals, and hard work doesn't strongly suggest a typical business administration personality. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes.  Many individuals in business administration could have the described traits, and many computer science students might not.  It's crucial to avoid over-generalizing.
