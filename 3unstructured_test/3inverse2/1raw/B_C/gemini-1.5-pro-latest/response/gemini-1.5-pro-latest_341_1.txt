Here's a breakdown of the probabilities and my reasoning:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The personality sketch leans towards interests and traits often found in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, math):**  Curiosity about nature, puzzle-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts. 
* **Computer Science:**  While the sketch doesn't explicitly mention technology, the traits described align well with someone who might be drawn to computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy and appreciation for hard work, which are relevant to business. However, the core interests (nature, puzzles, abstract concepts) are less typical drivers for someone choosing a business path.

**Important Notes:**

* **These probabilities are subjective:** There's no definitive way to assign probabilities to personality types and career choices.  People are complex!
* **Graduate student demographics matter:** The prevalence of certain personality types within specific graduate programs can influence the probabilities. 
* **Individual variation is vast:**  Many people in computer science or business administration wouldn't fit this personality sketch, and many people fitting this sketch choose other fields entirely.
