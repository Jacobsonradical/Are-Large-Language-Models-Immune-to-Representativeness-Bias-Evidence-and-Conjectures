Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ all traits often associated with computer science students. This makes the probability moderately high. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with business pursuits, like leadership, risk-taking, or a focus on finance/markets.  The probability is therefore lower.

**Important Notes:**

* These are just educated guesses based on stereotypes.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic choices.
* Many individuals in computer science and business administration possess the traits described, and many other fields also value these traits. 
* Adam's actual field of study could be entirely different from these two options.
