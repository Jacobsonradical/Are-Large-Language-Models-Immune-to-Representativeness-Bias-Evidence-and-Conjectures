Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the description could fit individuals in many fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in business professionals, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with computer science.  The love of nature and animals is less common but certainly possible in this field.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on general perceptions.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and nature-loving, while many computer scientists might not fit the "quiet, puzzle-solver" mold.  Personality is complex, and these fields attract a diverse range of individuals!
