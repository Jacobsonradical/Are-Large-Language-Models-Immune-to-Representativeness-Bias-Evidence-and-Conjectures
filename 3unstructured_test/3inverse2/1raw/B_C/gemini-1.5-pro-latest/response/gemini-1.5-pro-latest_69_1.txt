Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and general stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love for nature and animals isn't a strong indicator against this field either.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the sketch lacks a strong indication of traits often linked to this field, like leadership, ambition, or a focus on finance/economics. The emphasis on empathy and love for nature might be considered less common in a stereotypical business student profile.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information and should not be taken as definitive judgments.  Personality sketches offer a narrow view, and many individuals in business administration could easily possess these traits, and vice-versa for computer science.
