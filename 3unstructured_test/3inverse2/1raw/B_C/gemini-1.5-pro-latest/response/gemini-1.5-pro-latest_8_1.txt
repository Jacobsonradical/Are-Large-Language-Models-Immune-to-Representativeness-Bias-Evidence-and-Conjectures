Here's an estimated probability based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes traits often associated with individuals drawn to computer science: problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intellectual curiosity. The enjoyment of puzzles aligns well with computational thinking. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business aspirations like leadership, ambition for financial success, or interest in market dynamics.

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information.  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of academic fields. Many individuals with these traits excel in diverse areas.
