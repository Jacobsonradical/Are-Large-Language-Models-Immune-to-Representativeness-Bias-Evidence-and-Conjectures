Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles", "understanding abstract concepts") and intelligence, traits often associated with computer science students.  His love for nature and animals doesn't exclude this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks a strong indication of traits often associated with business students, such as ambition, leadership, or strong communication skills. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases based on personality sketches. People's interests and career choices are complex and can't be accurately predicted from a brief description.
