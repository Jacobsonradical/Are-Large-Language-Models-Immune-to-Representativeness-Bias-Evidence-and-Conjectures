Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (intelligence, hard work) are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking. These are less typical focuses in business programs.
* **Computer Science:**  The sketch aligns well with common perceptions of computer science students: puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, intelligence.  The love for nature and animals isn't a contradiction, just less directly associated.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** My analysis relies on common associations with these fields. Many individuals in business are nature-loving, and many computer scientists lack the empathy described.
* **Individual Variation:**  Even if the described traits were *more* common in computer science, that doesn't guarantee Adam fits the mold. 
* **Limited Information:**  The sketch is brief. More about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would drastically change the probability estimates.
