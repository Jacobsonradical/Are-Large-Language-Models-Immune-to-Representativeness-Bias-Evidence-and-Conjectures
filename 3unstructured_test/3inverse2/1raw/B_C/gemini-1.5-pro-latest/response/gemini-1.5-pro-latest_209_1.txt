Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes abstract thinking, problem-solving, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes empathy and a love for nature, which might be seen as less typical in a business-focused individual.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on common perceptions of these fields.  Individual students within each field vary greatly.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a narrow view of Adam's personality.  Other interests or experiences could significantly alter the probabilities. 
* **Graduate Study:** The fact that Adam is a graduate student slightly increases the likelihood of him being in a STEM field like computer science, but it's not definitive.
