Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) strongly align with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes a love for nature and animals, which might be less common motivators in that field. 

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on stereotypes.  Many individuals in business administration may share these personality traits, and many computer science students may not.  It's crucial to avoid making assumptions about individuals based solely on their field of study.
