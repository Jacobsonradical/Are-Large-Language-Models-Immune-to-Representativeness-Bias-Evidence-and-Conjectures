Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Puzzles relate to problem-solving, and abstract concepts are key in programming. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals might be seen as less common in a typical CS student.
* **Business Administration:** The profile doesn't strongly suggest business administration.  While "hard work and dedication" are valued in business, the other traits (nature, animals, abstract concepts) are less typical interests for this field.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and don't reflect the diversity within each field.  Many people in computer science love nature, and many in business are deeply empathetic.
* **Individuality:**  Personality is complex. This sketch provides a glimpse, but many other factors influence a person's field of study.
