Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, understanding abstract concepts, high intelligence) align well with skills often found in computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and a love for animals, which are less typical drivers for choosing business administration. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. Many individuals with these traits excel in diverse fields. These probabilities are simply estimations based on stereotypical associations.
