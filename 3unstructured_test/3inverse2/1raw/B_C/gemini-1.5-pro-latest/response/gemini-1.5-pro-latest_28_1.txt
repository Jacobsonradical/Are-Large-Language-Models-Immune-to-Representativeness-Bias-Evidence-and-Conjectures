Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are just educated guesses based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in business students, they aren't as stereotypical. Business programs often attract those interested in leadership, finance, and market dynamics. 
* **Computer Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with common perceptions of computer science students:  
    * **Problem-solving:** "Enjoys solving puzzles" is a classic indicator of an analytical mind drawn to computational challenges.
    * **Abstract Concepts:**  Understanding abstract concepts is crucial in computer science, from algorithms to data structures.
    * **Quiet/Introspective:** The "quiet boy" description fits the stereotype, though it's important to remember this is a generalization.

**Important Notes:**

* **Individual Variation:**  Personality sketches are broad strokes. Many individuals in business possess the traits described, and conversely, many in computer science might not.
* **Stereotype Limitations:**  We're relying on probabilities based on common perceptions of these fields. It's crucial to avoid using these probabilities to make assumptions about any specific individual.
