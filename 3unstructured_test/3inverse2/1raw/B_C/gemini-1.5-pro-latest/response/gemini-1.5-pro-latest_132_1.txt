Here's an estimated probability based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch mentions "enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts," which are traits often associated with individuals drawn to computer science.  The affinity for nature and animals doesn't contradict this, so the probability is moderate. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators like an interest in leadership, economics, or market trends. The emphasis on nature and animals makes a business administration path less likely.

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly subjective and based solely on a brief personality sketch.  
* Many other fields could align with the description (biology, environmental science, even creative writing). 
* Individual personalities within any field are highly diverse.
