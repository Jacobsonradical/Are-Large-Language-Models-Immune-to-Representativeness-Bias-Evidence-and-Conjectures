Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch relates to the fields and estimated probabilities:

**Business Administration:** While some traits (intelligence, hard work) are useful in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking, which are less central to traditional business administration.  

**Computer Science:** The sketch mentions puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and abstract thinking, all of which are strongly correlated with computer science.

**Estimated Probabilities:**

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Business Administration (0.2):**  The profile doesn't rule out business, but it suggests a stronger affinity for fields directly related to the described interests.
* **Computer Science (0.7):** The combination of puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence makes it more likely that the sketch describes someone in a field like computer science. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on general stereotypes.  Many individuals in business administration have strong empathy and a love for nature, and many computer scientists might not fit the description at all.  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of a person's field of study.
