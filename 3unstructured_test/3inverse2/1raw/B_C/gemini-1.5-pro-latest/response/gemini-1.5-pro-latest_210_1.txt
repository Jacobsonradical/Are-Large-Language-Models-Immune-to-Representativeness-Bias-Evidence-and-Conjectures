Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat well with a computer science student.  Puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and appreciation for complex systems are common in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** The description aligns less with the stereotypical image of a business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valued, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals might be less common focuses. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions of these fields. Many individuals in computer science and business administration defy these stereotypes.
* **Individual Variation:**  Personalities within any field are incredibly diverse.  
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a narrow view of Adam's interests and doesn't offer insight into his career aspirations or other factors influencing his field of study.
