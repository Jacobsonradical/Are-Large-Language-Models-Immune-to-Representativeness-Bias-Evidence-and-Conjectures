Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose interpretations of the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science. However, it lacks direct mentions of technology or programming, making it less certain.
* **Business Administration:** The sketch highlights empathy and understanding hard work, which are relevant to business. However, the focus on nature, animals, and quiet contemplation seems less aligned with the stereotypical image of a business student.

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly subjective and based on limited information.  
* Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of academic fields. People's interests and skills are diverse.
* Many individuals in computer science and business administration possess the traits described, and many in other fields do as well.
