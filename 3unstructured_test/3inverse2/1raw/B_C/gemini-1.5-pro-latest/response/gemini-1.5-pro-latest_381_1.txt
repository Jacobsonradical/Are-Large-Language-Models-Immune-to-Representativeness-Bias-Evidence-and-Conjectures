Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information given is not highly predictive:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes intellectual curiosity, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking â€“ all traits commonly associated with computer science students. However, the strong connection to nature and animals might be seen as slightly less typical.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence is certainly valuable in business, the sketch's emphasis on empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work could be considered less central to the stereotypical image of a business administration student.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes are limited:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and don't account for the diversity within each field. There are many compassionate and nature-loving individuals in business, just as there are highly analytical computer scientists passionate about animals.
* **Limited information:** The personality sketch provides some clues but is not definitive.  More information about Adam's specific interests, skills, and values would be needed for a more accurate assessment.
