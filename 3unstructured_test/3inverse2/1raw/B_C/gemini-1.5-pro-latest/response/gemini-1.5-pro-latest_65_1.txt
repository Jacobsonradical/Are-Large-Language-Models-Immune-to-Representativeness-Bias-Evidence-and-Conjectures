Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The personality sketch aligns somewhat well with a computer science student.  Puzzle-solving skills, abstract thinking, and appreciation for dedication are common in this field. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be slightly less common. 
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch aligns less obviously with a typical business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and a potentially quieter personality might be less common.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are very subjective.  Many individuals in computer science and business administration possess the traits described. It's crucial to avoid stereotyping based on fields of study.
