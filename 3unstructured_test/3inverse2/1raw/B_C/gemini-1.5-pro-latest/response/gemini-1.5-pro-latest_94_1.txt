Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in business people, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with common perceptions of individuals interested in computer science. The quiet and introspective nature also fits a general stereotype.

**Important Note:**  These are very rough estimates.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. Many people with these traits excel in business, while others in computer science might not fit this description at all.
