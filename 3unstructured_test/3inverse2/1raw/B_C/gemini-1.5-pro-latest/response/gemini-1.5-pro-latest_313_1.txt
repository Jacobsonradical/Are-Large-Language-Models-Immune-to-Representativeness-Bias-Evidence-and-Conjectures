Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat with a computer science student (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, intelligence). However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be slightly less common in this field. 
* **Business Administration:**  The personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While "hard work and dedication" are valued in business, the other traits point more towards interests in science or humanities.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on generalized assumptions.  Many computer science students are deeply connected to nature, and many business students are empathetic.
* **Individual Variation:**  Personalities within any field are incredibly diverse.  
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality but lacks specific interests or experiences that would offer stronger clues.
