Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and contains inherent biases:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles", "understanding abstract concepts"), a trait often associated with computer science fields.  His love for nature might be less common but doesn't preclude him from the field.
* **Business Administration:** While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks a strong indication of traits often associated with business aspirations, like leadership, risk-taking, or a focus on financial systems. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. Many individuals in business administration could have the traits described, and many computer scientists might not fit this description.
