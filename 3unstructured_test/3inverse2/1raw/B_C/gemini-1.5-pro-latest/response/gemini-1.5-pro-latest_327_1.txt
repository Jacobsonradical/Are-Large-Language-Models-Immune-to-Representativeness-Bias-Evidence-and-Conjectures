Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and potentially abstract concepts. These traits are less central to typical business administration studies.
* **Computer Science:**  The sketch highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and an understanding of abstract concepts â€“ all of which are strongly associated with computer science. This makes it more likely Adam would be in computer science than business administration based on the description.

**Important Notes:**

* **Individual Variation:**  Personalities within academic fields are diverse. These probabilities are rough estimations based on general stereotypes. 
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality, but it doesn't tell us about his specific skills, interests, or career aspirations, which are crucial in choosing a field of study.
