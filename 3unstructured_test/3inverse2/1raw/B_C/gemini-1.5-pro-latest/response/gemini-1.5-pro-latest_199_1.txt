Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description of someone who enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with traits often found in computer science students.  The affinity for nature and animals doesn't preclude this, and the overall intelligence described is a positive indicator. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature. These traits are not as strongly associated with typical business administration students compared to computer science. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on general stereotypes.  Individual personalities within any field are diverse, and there's no way to definitively say whether the sketch fits Adam based solely on his field of study.
