Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights traits often found in individuals drawn to computer science: puzzle-solving aptitude, abstract thinking, and high intelligence. While not a perfect match, these traits suggest a moderate probability (0.4). 
* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. These qualities are not as strongly associated with the typical image of a business administration student. Therefore, the probability is lower (0.2).

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on general stereotypes.  Individual personalities within any field are highly diverse.
