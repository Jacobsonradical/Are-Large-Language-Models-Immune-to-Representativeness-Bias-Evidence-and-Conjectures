Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The personality sketch leans slightly towards a "computer science" type:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "understanding abstract concepts" are often associated with individuals drawn to computer science.
* **However, it's not exclusive:**  The sketch also highlights "curiosity about nature," "love for animals," and "appreciation for hard work" â€“ qualities found in people across various fields, including business administration. 
* **Graduate student demographics:**  While not definitive, graduate programs in computer science tend to have a higher proportion of individuals with the described traits compared to business administration programs. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective estimation. Personality sketches can be interpreted in numerous ways, and many individuals in business administration possess the described traits (and vice-versa).
