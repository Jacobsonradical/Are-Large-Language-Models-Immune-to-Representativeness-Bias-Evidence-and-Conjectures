Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description heavily emphasizes analytical skills ("solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "understanding abstract concepts"). These are strongly associated with computer science fields. 
* **Business Administration:** While "hard work and dedication" are relevant to business, the other traits are less specific to this field. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches provide very limited information, and people in *any* field can have diverse interests and traits.
