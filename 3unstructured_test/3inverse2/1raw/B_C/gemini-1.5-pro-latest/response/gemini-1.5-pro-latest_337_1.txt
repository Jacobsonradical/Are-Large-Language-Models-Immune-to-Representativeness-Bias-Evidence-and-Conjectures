Here's a breakdown of how we can estimate the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

* **The Sketch:**  Emphasizes nature love, empathy, quietness, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking. These traits are often associated with scientific or creative fields.

* **Computer Science:**  Attracts individuals with strong logical, analytical, and problem-solving skills. While nature love isn't a strong stereotype, many computer scientists enjoy puzzles and abstract thinking. 
* **Business Administration:**  Focuses on management, leadership, strategy, and often interpersonal skills. The sketch doesn't strongly suggest these traits.

**Estimated Probabilities:**

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher probability for Computer Science** because the sketch aligns more strongly with typical traits associated with that field.
* **Lower probability for Business Administration** as the personality description doesn't heavily lean into the common stereotypes of that field. 

**Important Note:** These are rough estimates.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. People are diverse, and these fields attract individuals with a wide range of personalities and interests.
