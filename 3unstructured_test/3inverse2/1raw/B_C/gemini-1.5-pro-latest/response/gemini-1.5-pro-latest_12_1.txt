Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. However, the strong nature focus might be seen as less common, though not unheard of.
* **Business Administration:**  This profile is less typical of a business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the emphasis on empathy, nature, and animals might be less central to the field.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities rely heavily on common perceptions of these fields. Individual students within each discipline vary greatly.
* **Limited Information:** The personality sketch is brief. More details about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would drastically change these probabilities.
* **Graduate Level:**  At the graduate level, students in both fields may have more diverse backgrounds and interests than undergraduates.
