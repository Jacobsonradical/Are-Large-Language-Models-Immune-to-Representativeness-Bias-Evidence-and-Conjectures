Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The personality sketch aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Puzzles relate to problem-solving, and abstract thinking is crucial in programming. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals might be seen as less common in a typical computer science student. 
* **Business Administration:** The sketch aligns less strongly with a typical business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and a love for animals might be seen as less central to the field.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions of these fields.  Many individuals in computer science and business administration defy these stereotypes.
* **Individual Variation:**  Personalities within any field are incredibly diverse. This sketch might describe individuals in either field perfectly.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality, but we lack information about his specific interests within these fields.

**It's crucial to avoid using these probabilities for any decision-making or to make assumptions about individuals in these fields.**
