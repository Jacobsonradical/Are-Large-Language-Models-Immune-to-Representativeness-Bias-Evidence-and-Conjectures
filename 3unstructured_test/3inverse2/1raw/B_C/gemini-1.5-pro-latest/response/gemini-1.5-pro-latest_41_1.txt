**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch describes someone who enjoys problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciates hard work and dedication. These traits are found in individuals across many fields, including computer science and business administration. 

However, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and love for animals might be slightly less common in those pursuing computer science or business administration compared to fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. 

Therefore:

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  While problem-solving skills and abstract thinking are crucial in computer science, the other traits mentioned are not as strongly associated with the field.  
* **Business Administration (0.6):**  While business administration values hard work and dedication, the other characteristics described (love for nature, empathy, love for animals) are less typical for this field. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on general stereotypes and the provided personality sketch. There are individuals in both computer science and business administration who possess all the traits mentioned.
