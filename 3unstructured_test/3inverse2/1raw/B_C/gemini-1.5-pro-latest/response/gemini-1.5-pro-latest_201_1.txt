Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes abstract thinking, puzzle-solving, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  His love for nature doesn't preclude this, and many in tech fields appreciate the contrast.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests (e.g., finance, marketing, leadership). The emphasis on empathy and nature might suggest a less common personality fit for a traditional business program.

**Important Notes:**

* These are just estimates based on stereotypes. People are diverse, and many computer science students love nature, while many business students are deeply empathetic. 
* The provided sketch is limited.  More information about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would significantly impact the probability assessment.
