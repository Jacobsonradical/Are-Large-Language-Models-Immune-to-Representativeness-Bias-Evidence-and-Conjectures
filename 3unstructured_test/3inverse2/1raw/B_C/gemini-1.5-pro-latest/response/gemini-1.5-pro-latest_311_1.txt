Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, understanding abstract concepts, high intelligence) align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the description focuses more on analytical and nature-oriented aspects, making it seem less likely.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general associations.  Many individuals in business administration could have the described traits, and many computer science students might not.
* **Individuality:**  Personality is complex. This sketch provides a glimpse, but countless other factors influence a person's field of study.
