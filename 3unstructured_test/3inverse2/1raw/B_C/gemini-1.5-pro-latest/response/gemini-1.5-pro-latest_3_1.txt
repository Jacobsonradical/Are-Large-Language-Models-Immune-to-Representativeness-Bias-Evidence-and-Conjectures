Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with computer science. This makes it seem more likely, but not definitive.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities rely on general perceptions of these fields.  Many individuals in business administration are compassionate and nature-loving, and many computer science students might not fit the "quiet, puzzle-solver" mold.
* **Individual Variation:** People are diverse!  This sketch could easily describe individuals in either field, or even completely different areas. 

**In short, these probabilities are simply educated guesses based on common perceptions, not definitive statements about Adam's actual field of study.**
