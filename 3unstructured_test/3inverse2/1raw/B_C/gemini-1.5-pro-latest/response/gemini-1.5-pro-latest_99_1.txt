Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The description emphasizes problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, which are strong indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science. However, the love for nature and animals might be seen as less common (though not unheard of!) in that field. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence is certainly useful in business, the personality sketch emphasizes empathy, a warm heart, and appreciation for hard work. These traits are not exclusive to any field, but they could be seen as aligning less strongly with the stereotypical image of someone driven primarily by business success.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid strong biases. Many people in computer science have deep connections to nature, and many in business are deeply empathetic. This assessment is based on probabilities drawn from general perceptions and limited information.
