Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on the provided personality sketch and contains inherent bias:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes abstract thinking, puzzle-solving, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests (e.g., finance, marketing, leadership). The emphasis on nature and empathy might suggest a lower probability.

**Important Notes:**

* **Overgeneralization:**  These probabilities are based on stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration may share the described traits, and many computer science students may not.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch is brief.  More details about Adam's specific interests, hobbies, or experiences would lead to a more accurate assessment.
