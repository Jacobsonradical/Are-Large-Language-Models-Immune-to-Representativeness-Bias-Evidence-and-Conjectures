Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The description emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The sketch highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with computer science.  The love for nature and animals could be seen as less common but not unheard of in this field.

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly subjective. There's a wide range of personalities within any field.
* This assessment relies on general perceptions and doesn't account for individual variation. 
* A real-world analysis would require much more data about Adam and graduate student demographics.
