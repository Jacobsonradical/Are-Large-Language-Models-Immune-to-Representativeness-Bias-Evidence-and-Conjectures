Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. This makes the probability moderately high.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and a love for animals. These traits are less typical markers for business administration students, leading to a lower probability. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotypes:** These are just probabilities based on common perceptions. Many individuals in business administration may share the described traits, and many computer science students might not. 
* **Individuality:**  Personality sketches offer a limited view. Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
