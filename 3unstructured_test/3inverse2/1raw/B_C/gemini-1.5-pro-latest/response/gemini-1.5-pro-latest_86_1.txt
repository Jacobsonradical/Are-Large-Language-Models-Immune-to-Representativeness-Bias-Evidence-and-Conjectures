Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles", "understanding abstract concepts"), which are strong indicators of someone potentially interested in computer science.  The love for nature and animals doesn't exclude this field.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the description leans more towards interests often associated with scientific or nature-related fields. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to understand that personality sketches are not foolproof predictors of someone's field of study. People are diverse, and these are just rough estimations.
