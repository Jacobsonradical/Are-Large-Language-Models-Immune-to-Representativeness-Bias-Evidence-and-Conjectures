Here's a breakdown of how we can approach estimating the probabilities, keeping in mind this is highly speculative:

* **The Sketch:** The description leans towards someone who is introspective, enjoys problem-solving, and has a strong affinity for nature. 

* **Stereotypes (and their limitations):**  We often rely on stereotypes about different fields when making these kinds of judgments, even though they are often inaccurate. For example:
    * **Business administration** is often associated with extroversion, networking, and a focus on finance/marketing.
    * **Computer science** is associated with logical thinking, problem-solving, and sometimes a preference for solitary work. 

* **Overlaps:** The sketch has elements that could overlap with both fields:
    * **Intelligence and Abstract Thinking:** Valuable in both business and computer science.
    * **Hard work and dedication:**  Important for success in any graduate program.

**Estimated Probabilities:**

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** The puzzle-solving aspect, coupled with the subject's intelligence and appreciation for abstract concepts, aligns more strongly with common perceptions of computer science students.
* **Business Administration (0.3):** While the description doesn't strongly contradict the idea of Adam being in business administration, it doesn't offer compelling evidence for it either. The emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical in that field.

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information and common stereotypes. It's impossible to accurately determine Adam's field of study based solely on this personality sketch.
