Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  While the description emphasizes empathy and love for animals, it also highlights intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving â€“ traits often associated with computer science. It's plausible, hence a moderate probability.

* **Business Administration:** The sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, ambition, or a focus on financial success.  The emphasis on empathy and nature might be seen as less common in a stereotypical business program. Therefore, a higher probability is assigned to this field.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to recognize that these are just educated guesses based on broad generalizations.  Individual personalities within any field are highly diverse.
