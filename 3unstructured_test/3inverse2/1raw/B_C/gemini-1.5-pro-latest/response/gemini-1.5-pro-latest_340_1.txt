Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the personality sketch alone:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. The love for nature and animals doesn't contradict this, and many computer scientists have diverse interests.
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business, the sketch lacks traits often associated with business students, such as ambition, leadership, or a strong interest in finance/economics. The emphasis on empathy and nature aligns less with common perceptions of the field.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are insufficient to predict someone's field of study accurately. Many individuals in business administration could easily fit the described personality, and many computer science students might not.
