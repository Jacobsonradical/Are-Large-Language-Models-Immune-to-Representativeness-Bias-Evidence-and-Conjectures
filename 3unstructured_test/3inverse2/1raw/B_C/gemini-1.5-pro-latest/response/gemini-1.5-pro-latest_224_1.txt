Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is fairly general:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits of puzzle-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence align more strongly with stereotypes of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, animals, and quietness, which are less typical (though not unheard of!) in business student stereotypes.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic pursuits. Many individuals in business may share the described traits, and many computer science students might not.
