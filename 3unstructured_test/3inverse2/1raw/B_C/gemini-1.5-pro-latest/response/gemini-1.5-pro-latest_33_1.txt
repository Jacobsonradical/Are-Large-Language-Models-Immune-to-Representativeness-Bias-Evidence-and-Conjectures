Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights traits often associated with individuals drawn to computer science: problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, and a potential interest in systems (relatable to nature's complexity). 
* **Business Administration:** While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature, animals, and quiet contemplation might be seen as less typical for someone drawn to this field.

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on limited information. It's crucial to avoid strong assumptions about a person's field of study solely from a personality sketch. Individual interests and career paths are far more diverse and complex.
