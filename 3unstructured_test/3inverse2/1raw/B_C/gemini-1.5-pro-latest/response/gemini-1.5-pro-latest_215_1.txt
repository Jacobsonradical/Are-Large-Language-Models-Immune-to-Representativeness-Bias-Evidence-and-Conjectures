Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and prone to stereotype bias:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business, the sketch's focus on nature, empathy, and a "quiet" demeanor are less stereotypical of business administration students compared to computer science.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches offer very limited information, and many individuals in business administration could easily fit the described traits.
