Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. The love for nature and animals could be seen as contrasting, but many computer scientists have diverse interests.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality sketch lacks clear indicators of traits often associated with business students, such as ambition, leadership, or strong communication skills.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** My reasoning relies on common stereotypes associated with these fields. These stereotypes are not always accurate and should not be used to make judgments about individuals.
* **Limited Information:**  The personality sketch is brief. More information about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would be needed for a more accurate assessment.
