Here's a breakdown of how we can approach estimating the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

* **The Sketch:** The description leans towards a personality drawn to fields involving nature, empathy (possibly caregiving), problem-solving, and intellectual pursuits.

* **Computer Science:**  While many computer scientists are intellectually curious and enjoy problem-solving, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of a passion for technology or abstract systems that often draw people to computer science.

* **Business Administration:** This field is quite broad. The sketch doesn't strongly point towards business acumen, leadership, or a drive for financial success â€“ traits often associated with business administration. 

**Estimated Probabilities:**

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  We're assigning a moderate probability. The problem-solving skills and intelligence mentioned could apply, but the overall profile doesn't strongly suggest a typical computer science student. 
* **Business Administration (0.3):** We're assigning a lower probability. The sketch lacks clear indicators of someone drawn to the core aspects of business and management.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. There's a wide range of personalities within any field.
