Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on stereotypes associated with the personality description and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description highlights intellectual curiosity, puzzle-solving skills, and an understanding of abstract concepts â€“ all traits often associated with computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch emphasizes empathy, a love for animals, and a connection to nature. These traits are less stereotypically associated with business administration compared to computer science.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember these are just probabilities based on general perceptions. Many individuals in business administration possess strong empathy and a love for nature, just as many computer science students might not fit the described personality. This exercise is about exploring perceived correlations, not making definitive judgments.
