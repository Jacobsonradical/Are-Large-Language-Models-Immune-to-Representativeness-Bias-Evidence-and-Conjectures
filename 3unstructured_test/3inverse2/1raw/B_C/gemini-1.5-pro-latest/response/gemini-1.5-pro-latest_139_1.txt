Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles"), abstract reasoning, and intelligence. These traits are strongly associated with computer science fields. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with business administration, such as leadership, ambition for financial success, or strong interpersonal/persuasion skills. 

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration possess the traits described, and many computer science students might not fit the profile perfectly.  Personality is complex, and this sketch doesn't provide enough information for a definitive answer.
