Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:** The description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with common perceptions of those drawn to computer science. The quiet, nature-loving aspect might be seen as slightly less common, but not unheard of.

**Important Notes:**

* **Individual Variation:**  Personality is highly individual.  Many people in business administration are deeply empathetic, and many computer scientists are very outgoing.
* **Limited Information:** We have a very short sketch and only know Adam was a graduate student in 2021.  This is not a lot to go on!

**It's crucial to avoid overgeneralizing based on these probabilities. They are simply estimations based on limited information and common stereotypes.**
