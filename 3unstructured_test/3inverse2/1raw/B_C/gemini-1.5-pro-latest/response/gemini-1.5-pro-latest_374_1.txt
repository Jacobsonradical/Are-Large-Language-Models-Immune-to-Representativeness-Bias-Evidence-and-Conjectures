Here's a breakdown of how we might estimate the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

**Personality Sketch Analysis:**

* **Nature & Plants:**  Slightly suggests fields like biology, environmental science, but doesn't rule out others.
* **Quiet, Puzzles, Abstract Concepts:**  Commonly associated with STEM fields, including computer science.
* **Warm Heart, Empathy, Love for Animals:**  Could indicate interests in fields like social work, veterinary medicine, but doesn't preclude other areas.
* **Understanding of Hard Work:**  A general trait, applicable to most fields.

**Probability Estimates:**

Since the personality sketch leans towards traits often associated with computer science, it's slightly more likely that Adam wasn't studying that if he was in a different field. Business administration is less directly suggested by the sketch. However, many personality types thrive in business.

Here's a possible interpretation, acknowledging the limitations:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Important Note:** These are highly speculative estimates.  People are diverse, and a personality sketch provides very limited information for predicting someone's field of study.
