Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are just educated guesses based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (intelligence, hard work) are valued in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking. These aren't as stereotypical in business students.
* **Computer Science:**  The puzzle-solving aspect, high intelligence, and abstract thinking align well with common perceptions of computer science students.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on generalizations. Many individuals in business possess the traits described, and many computer science students might not. 
* **Individual Variation:**  Personality is complex.  Adam's specific interests within his chosen field could make him more or less like the sketch.
* **Limited Information:**  The sketch and Adam's 2021 status provide very little to go on. Other factors (hobbies, background, etc.) would drastically change the probabilities.
