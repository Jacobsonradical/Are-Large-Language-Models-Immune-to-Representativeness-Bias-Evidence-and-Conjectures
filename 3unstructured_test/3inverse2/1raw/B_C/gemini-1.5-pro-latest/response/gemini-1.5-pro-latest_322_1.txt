Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  While not exclusive to the field, these factors increase the likelihood. 
* **Business Administration (0.3):** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the emphasis on nature, animals, and potentially solitary pursuits (puzzles) makes it less likely.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on stereotypes.  In reality, people's personalities and career choices are far more diverse. This exercise is about applying probabilities to limited information, not making definitive judgments.
