  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch highlights traits that could be applicable to various fields but might make someone less likely to pursue business administration.

* **Curiosity about nature, love for animals, quiet, puzzle-solving:** These traits are not strongly associated with either computer science or business administration.
* **Warm heart, strong empathy:** While positive traits in any field, these are less typical markers of success in the stereotypically analytical fields of computer science and business.
* **High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts:** This is where the sketch points more towards computer science.  Strong analytical and abstract thinking skills are highly valued in that field.

**Therefore:**

* **Computer Science:**  A moderate probability (0.4) is assigned because the "high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts" aspect aligns well, while other traits are less specific.
* **Business Administration:** A lower probability (0.2) is assigned because the personality sketch emphasizes empathy and a love for nature, which are not as stereotypical in a business context. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on stereotypes and limited information.  Many successful individuals in both fields defy these common perceptions.
