Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, and appreciation for dedication are common in this field. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be less typical. 
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch aligns less strongly with the stereotypical image of a business administration student. While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the focus on nature, empathy, and animals might be less common.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities rely on generalized assumptions about different fields.  Individual personalities within any field vary greatly.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch is brief.  More details about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would dramatically change the probability assessment.
