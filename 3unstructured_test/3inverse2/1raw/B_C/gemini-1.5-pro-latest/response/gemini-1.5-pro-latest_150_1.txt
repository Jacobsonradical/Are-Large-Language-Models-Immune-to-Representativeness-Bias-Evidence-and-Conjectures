Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes intellectual curiosity, problem-solving aptitude, and understanding abstract concepts. These traits are strongly aligned with computer science, making it a more likely field for Adam. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests (e.g., leadership, finance, marketing).  The emphasis on nature and animals suggests interests that might be less common in business-focused individuals.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Personality sketches can be misleading, and many individuals in business administration possess the traits described.
