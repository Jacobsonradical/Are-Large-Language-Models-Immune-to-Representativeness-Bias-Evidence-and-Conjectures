Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes abstract thinking, problem-solving (puzzles), and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. The connection to nature and animals isn't a strong indicator against this field.
* **Business Administration:** While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the sketch's focus on nature, quietness, and a love for animals might be seen as less typical for someone drawn to this field. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of academic fields. There are many compassionate and nature-loving individuals in business, and many analytically-minded computer scientists who adore animals.
