Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch relates to the fields and how I'd estimate the probabilities:

**Personality Traits and Potential Field Relevance:**

* **Nature Curiosity & Plant Interest:** This suggests potential alignment with environmental science, biology, or even landscape architecture. It's not a strong indicator for business or computer science.
* **Quiet, Puzzle-Solving, Abstract Thinking:** These traits are often associated with fields like mathematics, computer science, engineering, and some areas of research within business (analytics). 
* **Warm Heart, Empathy, Animal Love:** These traits are less directly tied to specific fields but could indicate interests in veterinary medicine, animal care, or social work.  

**Probabilities:**

Considering this, here's my best estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract thinking" traits could apply to someone in business, the overall profile doesn't strongly suggest it. There's nothing inherently opposed to the traits, but they aren't particularly strong indicators either. 
* **Computer Science:**  The profile aligns well with the stereotypical image of someone drawn to computer science â€“ analytical, enjoys problem-solving, and comfortable with abstract concepts. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Individual Variation:** These are just probabilities based on general tendencies. Many individuals in business are deeply empathetic, and plenty of people in computer science are passionate about nature.
* **Limited Information:** We only have a brief sketch.  Adam's specific interests within computer science or business (if he had any) would dramatically change the probabilities.
