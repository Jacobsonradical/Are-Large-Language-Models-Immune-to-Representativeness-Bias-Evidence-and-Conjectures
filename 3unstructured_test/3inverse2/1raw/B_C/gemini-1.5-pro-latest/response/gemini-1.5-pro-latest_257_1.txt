}
```

**Reasoning:**

    * **Positive Signals:** Enjoys problem-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence are common traits in computer science.
    * **Neutral Signals:**  Curiosity about nature and love for animals aren't uncommon but don't strongly point to computer science.
    * **Overall:** A decent chance, but not a strong correlation.

* **Business Administration:** The description aligns less well with a typical business administration student.
    * **Weak Signals:** While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, they aren't the primary traits associated with the field. 
    * **Missing Signals:** The sketch lacks common indicators of business interest like leadership, ambition, or financial acumen.
    * **Overall:** A lower probability compared to computer science.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and stereotypes. There's a wide range of personalities within any field. 
* **Individual Variation:** Adam's specific interests and experiences within his chosen field could significantly influence how his personality manifests. 
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality. More information would be needed for a more accurate assessment.
