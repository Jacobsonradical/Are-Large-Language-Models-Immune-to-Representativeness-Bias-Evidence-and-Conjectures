Here's a breakdown of the probabilities and my reasoning:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The personality sketch emphasizes analytical skills ("solving puzzles", "understanding abstract concepts"), which are highly relevant to computer science.  The love of nature and empathy, while not exclusive to computer science, don't contradict the profile. Therefore, the probability is moderate.

* **Business Administration:** While "hard work and dedication" are valued in business, the other traits (love for nature, empathy, puzzle-solving) are less directly applicable compared to a field like computer science. This makes the probability lower.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly subjective.  The personality sketch provides some clues, but it's not definitive in predicting a person's field of study.  Many individuals with these traits could excel in various fields.
