Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information given is minimal:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (hard work, intelligence) are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and a love for animals. These traits are not as stereotypical of someone drawn to business administration.
* **Computer Science:**  The description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with common perceptions of computer science students. The "quiet boy" trope also fits a stereotypical image of the field.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes.  People are diverse, and many individuals in business administration could easily fit the personality sketch, and many computer science students might not.
