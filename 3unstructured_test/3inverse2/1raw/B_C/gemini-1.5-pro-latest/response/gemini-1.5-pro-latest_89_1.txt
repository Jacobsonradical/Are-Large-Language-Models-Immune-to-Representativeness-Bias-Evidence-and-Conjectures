Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ all traits that align well with computer science.  While not a definitive indicator, the love for nature and animals might be slightly less common in computer science, hence a moderate probability. 
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch highlights empathy, understanding of hard work, and a warm heart. While these are positive qualities in any field, they aren't as strongly associated with the core skills and focus of business administration compared to something like social work or psychology. This leads to a lower probability. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on stereotypes. Many individuals in computer science are deeply connected to nature, and many business professionals possess strong empathy.  Personality sketches provide very limited information for accurate predictions.
