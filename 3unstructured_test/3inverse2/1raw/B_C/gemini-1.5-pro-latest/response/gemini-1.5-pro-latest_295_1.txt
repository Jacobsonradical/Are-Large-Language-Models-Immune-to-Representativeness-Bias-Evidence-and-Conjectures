Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While empathy and understanding hard work are relevant to business, the other traits (love for nature, puzzles, abstract concepts) are less typical.  A probability of 0.3 reflects this moderate chance.
* **Computer Science:** The sketch aligns well with traits often found in computer science students: puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and potentially a connection between nature's patterns and computational systems. Hence, the higher probability of 0.6. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on stereotypes and general observations. Individual personalities within any field are highly diverse.
