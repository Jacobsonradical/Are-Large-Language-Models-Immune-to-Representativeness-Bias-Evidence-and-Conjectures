Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles", "understanding abstract concepts"), which aligns strongly with computer science.  His love for nature and animals doesn't exclude this field, and many in tech fields have such interests.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in business concepts like finance, marketing, or organizational behavior. The emphasis on nature and animals leans away from a stereotypical business student profile.

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information. Many individuals with the described traits could thrive in either field.
