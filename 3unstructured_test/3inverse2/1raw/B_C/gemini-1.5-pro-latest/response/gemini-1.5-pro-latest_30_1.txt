Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) strongly align with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the description emphasizes a connection to nature, empathy, and a love for animals. These traits are less typical indicators of a business administration student.

**Important Notes:**

* This is a highly subjective assessment based on stereotypes and limited information. 
*  Individual personalities within any field are diverse, and many people in business administration could easily possess these traits. 
* These probabilities are not based on statistical data and should be taken as rough estimations.
