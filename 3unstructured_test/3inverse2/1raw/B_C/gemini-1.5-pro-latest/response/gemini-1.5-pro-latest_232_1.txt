Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical skills ("solving puzzles"), abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love for nature might be less common but certainly not unheard of in that field.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature, animals, and quiet contemplation aligns less strongly with the stereotypical image of a business administration student.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and not on concrete data. Individual personalities within any field are highly diverse.
* **Sketch Bias:** The personality sketch might be unintentionally biased towards certain fields, making some characteristics seem more important than they are for predicting a person's field of study.
