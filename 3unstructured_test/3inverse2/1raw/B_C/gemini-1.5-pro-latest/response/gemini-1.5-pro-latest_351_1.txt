Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with individuals drawn to computer science.  

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on common stereotypes. It's crucial to avoid making assumptions about individuals based solely on their field of study. Many people in business administration are deeply empathetic and many computer scientists are passionate about nature.
