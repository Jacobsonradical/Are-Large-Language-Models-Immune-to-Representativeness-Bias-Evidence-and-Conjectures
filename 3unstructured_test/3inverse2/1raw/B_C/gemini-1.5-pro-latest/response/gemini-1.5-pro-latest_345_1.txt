Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Puzzles relate to problem-solving, and abstract thinking is crucial in programming. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals is less typical.  
* **Business Administration:** The profile doesn't strongly suggest a business administration student. While understanding hard work and dedication is important in business, the other traits (love for nature, empathy) are less central to the field's stereotype. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. Many individuals in computer science are deeply connected to nature, and many in business administration are empathetic and animal lovers.
