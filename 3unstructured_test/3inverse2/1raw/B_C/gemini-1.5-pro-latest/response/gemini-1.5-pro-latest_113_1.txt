Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose guidelines based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in business students, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description highlights intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving â€“ traits often associated with computer science.  The connection to nature and animals is less typical but not unheard of in this field.

**Important Notes:**

* **Individual Variation:**  Personality is complex, and many individuals in business possess the traits described. These probabilities are based on broad generalizations.
* **Limited Information:** We have a very brief sketch of Adam. More information about his specific interests, skills, and experiences would drastically change the probability estimates.
