Here's an interpretation of the personality sketch and how it might relate to the given fields:

**Analysis**

The sketch describes someone who is:

* **Intellectually Curious:** Enjoys puzzles and abstract concepts.
* **Drawn to Nature:**  A love of plants suggests an affinity for the natural world.
* **Empathetic:**  Warm heart, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.

**Field Probabilities**

While these traits could be found in individuals across various fields, here's a breakdown:

* **Computer Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an analytical mind drawn to problem-solving (puzzles, abstract concepts). This aligns well with computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** The sketch emphasizes empathy and understanding, which are valuable in business but not as uniquely defining as the analytical traits are for computer science. 

**Estimated Probabilities**

  "computer science": "0.7",

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many other factors (personal experiences, specific interests within a field, etc.) influence a person's career choice.
