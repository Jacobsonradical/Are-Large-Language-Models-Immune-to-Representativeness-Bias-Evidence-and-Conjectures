Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes associated with personality traits and academic fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence, hard work, and understanding complex concepts are valuable in business, the description emphasizes nature, empathy, and a quiet demeanor. These traits are less stereotypically associated with business administration programs. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description aligns more strongly with stereotypes of computer science students: problem-solving ("enjoys solving puzzles"), abstract thinking, and a quiet, introspective nature. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities rely heavily on common stereotypes.  Individual personalities within any field are diverse.
* **Limited Information:** The personality sketch is brief. More information about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would significantly impact the probability estimates.
