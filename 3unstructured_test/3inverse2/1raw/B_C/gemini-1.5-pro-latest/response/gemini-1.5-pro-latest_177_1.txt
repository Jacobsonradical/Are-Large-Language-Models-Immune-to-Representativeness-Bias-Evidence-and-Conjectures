Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the given personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (higher probability):** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with individuals drawn to computer science.  The love of nature and empathy, while not exclusive to computer science, don't contradict it either. 

* **Business Administration (lower probability):** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business aspirations, such as leadership, ambition for financial success, or strong interpersonal skills. The emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less common in a stereotypical business-oriented personality.

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on general stereotypes.  Many individuals in business administration may share the traits described, and many computer science students might not.  Personality sketches are not definitive predictors of career choices.
