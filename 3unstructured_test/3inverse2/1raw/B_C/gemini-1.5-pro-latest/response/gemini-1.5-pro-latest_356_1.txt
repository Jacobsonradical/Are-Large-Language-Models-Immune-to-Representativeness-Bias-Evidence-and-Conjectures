Here's my assessment of the probabilities, based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles"), understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence. These traits are strongly associated with computer science fields.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature, animals, and quiet contemplation doesn't align as strongly with the typical perception of a business administration student.

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective assessment based on stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration share the described traits, and many computer science students might not. This is simply an estimation based on the provided information.
