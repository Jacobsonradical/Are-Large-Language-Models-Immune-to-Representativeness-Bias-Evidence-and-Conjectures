Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a very brief and general personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The description emphasizes problem-solving, intelligence, and abstract thinking â€“ traits often associated with computer science. However, the lack of direct mention of technology or coding keeps the probability moderate. 
* **Business Administration:** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the core interests (nature, animals, puzzles) point away from a business focus.  

**Important Notes:**

* This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic pursuits.
* Many other fields (biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine) would likely have higher probabilities based on the description.
