Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights traits often associated with computer science: problem-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be less common in this field, lowering the probability.
* **Business Administration:**  This field is less directly connected to the traits described. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy suggests a lower likelihood. 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are subjective and based on general stereotypes.  Individual personalities within any field are highly diverse.
* The provided information is limited. Knowing Adam's specific interests within his field, hobbies, or other personality nuances would significantly impact the probability estimates.
