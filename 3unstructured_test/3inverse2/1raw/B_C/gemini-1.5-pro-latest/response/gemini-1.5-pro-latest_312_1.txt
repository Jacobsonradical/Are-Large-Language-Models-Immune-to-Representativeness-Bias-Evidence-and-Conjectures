Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (intelligence, hard work) are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking.  These aren't as stereotypically associated with business administration.
* **Computer Science:**  The sketch aligns better with common perceptions of computer science students: puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and quiet contemplation. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities rely heavily on generalizations. Many individuals in business administration are nature lovers, and many computer science students don't fit the "quiet puzzle solver" mold.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch is brief. More details about Adam's hobbies, passions, or career aspirations would drastically change the probability estimates.
