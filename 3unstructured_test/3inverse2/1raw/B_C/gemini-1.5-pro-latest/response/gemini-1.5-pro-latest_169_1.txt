Here's my attempt at providing probabilities based solely on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love for nature and animals doesn't contradict this.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of a business-oriented personality (e.g., leadership, risk-taking, financial acumen). 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Limited Information:** The personality sketch is brief.  Real-world career choices are far more complex and depend on a multitude of factors beyond these basic traits.
* **Stereotypes:** My assessment might be unconsciously influenced by common stereotypes associated with these fields.
* **Individual Variation:**  There's a wide range of personalities within any field. Many compassionate and nature-loving individuals excel in business.

**Therefore, these probabilities should be taken with a large grain of salt.**
