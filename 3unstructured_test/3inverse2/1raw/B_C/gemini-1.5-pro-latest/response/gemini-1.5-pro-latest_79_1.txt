Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on stereotypes associated with the personality description and doesn't reflect the reality of diverse interests within fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description aligns somewhat with a computer science student (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking). However, the strong emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals might be seen as less typical, lowering the probability slightly. 
* **Business Administration:**  The profile doesn't strongly suggest a typical business administration student. While "hard work and dedication" are valued in business, the other traits point more towards interests in science or humanities.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative. Many individuals in computer science and business administration possess the traits described. This exercise is purely for exploring potential biases and does not reflect the true distribution of personalities within these fields.
