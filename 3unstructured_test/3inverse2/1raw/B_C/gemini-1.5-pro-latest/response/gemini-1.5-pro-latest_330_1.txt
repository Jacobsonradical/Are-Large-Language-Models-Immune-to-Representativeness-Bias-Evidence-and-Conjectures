Here's a breakdown of how the personality traits might align with the fields and a probability estimate:

**Probability Estimates:**

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence, empathy, and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, animals, and abstract thinking. These traits are less central to a typical business administration program. 
* **Computer Science:**  The love for puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.  A quiet, thoughtful individual often thrives in problem-solving environments common in this field. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on general stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field are diverse.
