Here's an estimated probability based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "understanding abstract concepts"), which are strongly associated with computer science.  The love for nature and animals doesn't contradict this and could be seen as a counterbalance to a technical field. 
* **Business Administration:** While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks a strong indication of traits typically associated with business aspirations, such as leadership, ambition for financial success, or strong communication skills.  

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information. It's impossible to definitively say what field Adam was in without more data.  Personality traits can be found in individuals across all disciplines.
