Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is purely speculative based on stereotypes associated with the fields and the personality description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The description highlights problem-solving skills ("enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "understands abstract concepts") which are strong indicators of someone potentially interested in computer science. However, the heavy emphasis on nature and empathy might be considered less typical for the field, lowering the probability slightly.
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality description emphasizes traits (love of nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) that are not as strongly associated with the stereotype of a business administration student.  

**Important Note:**  These are very rough estimations.  People's personalities and interests are diverse, and there are individuals passionate about nature and animals within both computer science and business fields.
