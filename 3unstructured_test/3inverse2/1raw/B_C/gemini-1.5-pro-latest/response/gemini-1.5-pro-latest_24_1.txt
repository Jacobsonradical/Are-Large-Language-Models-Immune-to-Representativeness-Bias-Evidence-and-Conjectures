Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and a very limited personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch mentions puzzle-solving and understanding abstract concepts, traits often associated with computer science.  His love for nature and animals isn't a strong indicator against this field either. 
* **Business Administration:** While someone with this personality profile *could* go into business, the description lacks strong indicators like leadership, ambition, or a focus on financial success â€“ traits often associated with business administration.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of career choices.  Many other factors influence career decisions.
