Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are just educated guesses based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for someone in a more scientifically or nature-oriented field. 
* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding of abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with computer science. The love for nature and animals might be less common but certainly not unheard of in this field. 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are based on general perceptions and don't account for the vast diversity within each field. There are plenty of compassionate and nature-loving individuals in business, just as there are computer scientists passionate about animals.
* The provided information about Adam being a graduate student in the US in 2021 doesn't significantly change the probabilities.
