Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information given could describe people in many fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (intelligence, hard work) are valued in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking â€“ not stereotypical business traits.
* **Computer Science:**  The puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence mentioned align well with common perceptions of computer science students. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information. It's crucial to avoid stereotyping individuals based on their field of study.
