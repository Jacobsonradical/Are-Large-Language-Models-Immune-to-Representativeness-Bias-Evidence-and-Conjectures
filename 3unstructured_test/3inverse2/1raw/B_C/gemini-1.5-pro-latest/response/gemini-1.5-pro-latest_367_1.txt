Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, intelligence) align well with common perceptions of computer science students. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical, lowering the probability slightly.
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality description emphasizes qualities (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) often less associated with stereotypical business student profiles. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are based on VERY general assumptions.  Individual personalities within any field vary greatly. There are plenty of nature-loving, empathetic individuals in both computer science and business administration!
