Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The sketch leans towards a profile often associated with STEM fields:** Curiosity about nature, puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and appreciation for hard work are common traits among those drawn to science and technology.
* **Computer science aligns more strongly:**  The emphasis on puzzle-solving and abstract concepts is particularly relevant to computer science. 
* **Business administration is still possible:** While the sketch doesn't scream "business,"  intelligence, empathy, and understanding hard work are valuable in business contexts. However, the lack of specific indicators towards business acumen or leadership makes it less likely.

**Important Notes:**

* These are just estimates based on general stereotypes.  Personality is complex, and many individuals in business administration possess the traits described.
* The provided information is limited.  Knowing Adam's specific interests within his field (e.g., environmental management within business or AI ethics within computer science) would drastically change the probabilities.
