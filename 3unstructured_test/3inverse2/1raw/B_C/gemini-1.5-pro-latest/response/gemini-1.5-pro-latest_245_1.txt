Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on stereotype and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and abstract thought doesn't align as strongly with common perceptions of business students. 
* **Computer Science:**  The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, intelligence) are often associated with individuals drawn to computer science.  

**Important Notes:**

* These are highly subjective probabilities based on limited information and stereotypes. 
* Many individuals in business administration possess the traits described, and many computer science students might not fit this profile.
* A true probability would require a much larger dataset of student personalities across different fields.
