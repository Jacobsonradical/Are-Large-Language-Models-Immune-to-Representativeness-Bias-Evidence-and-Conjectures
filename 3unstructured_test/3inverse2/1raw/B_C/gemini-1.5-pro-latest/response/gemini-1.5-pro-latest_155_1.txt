Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch aligns somewhat with a computer science student.  Puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence are common traits in that field. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less typical. 
* **Business Administration:** This profile is less typical of a business administration student.  While intelligence and hard work are valued, the focus on nature, empathy, and a lack of explicit mention of ambition or leadership qualities make it less likely.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on general perceptions.  Many individuals in computer science are deeply empathetic and connected to nature, and many business students are animal lovers.  It's crucial to avoid stereotyping based on fields of study.
