Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love for nature and animals, while not exclusive to CS, doesn't contradict the stereotype.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks a strong indication of traits often associated with business students, such as leadership, ambition, or interest in finance/economics.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic pursuits. Many individuals with these traits might choose business, and many computer science students might not fit this description.
