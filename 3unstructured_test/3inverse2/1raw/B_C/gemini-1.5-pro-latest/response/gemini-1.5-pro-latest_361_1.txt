Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (hard work, intelligence) are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking. These aren't *uncommon* in business students, but they're not the primary focus.
* **Computer Science:**  The love for puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.  A quiet, nature-loving person might find solace in the more analytical aspects of the field.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on generalized assumptions about these fields.  Many individuals in business are deeply empathetic, and many in computer science may not be interested in nature.
* **Individual Variation:** Adam's specific interests within each field could drastically change these probabilities. A focus on environmental sustainability in business or bioinformatics in computer science would make him more likely.
* **Limited Information:** We know very little about Adam beyond this sketch. His undergraduate major, hobbies, and life experiences would greatly impact the accuracy of these estimates.
