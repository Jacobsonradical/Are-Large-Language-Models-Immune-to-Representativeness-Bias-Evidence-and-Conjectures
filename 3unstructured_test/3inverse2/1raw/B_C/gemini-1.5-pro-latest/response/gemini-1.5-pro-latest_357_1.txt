Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.65"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description highlights puzzle-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence â€“ all traits often associated with computer science students. This makes the probability somewhat likely, but not definitive. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the sketch emphasizes traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) less stereotypically associated with business administration programs. This makes it slightly more probable that Adam was *not* in business administration, though not by a large margin.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These estimations rely on common perceptions of these fields. Individual students within any field are incredibly diverse.
* **Limited Information:** The personality sketch is brief. More information about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would drastically change the probability assessment.
