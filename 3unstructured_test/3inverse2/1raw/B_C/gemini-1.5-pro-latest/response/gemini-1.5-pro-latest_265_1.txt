Here's an attempt to quantify the likelihood based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence, all traits commonly associated with computer science students. This makes the probability moderately high.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature, empathy, and animal love doesn't strongly align with the stereotypical image of a business administration student. This makes the probability lower.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and don't account for the diversity within each field. There are undoubtedly nature-loving business students and puzzle-solving computer science students who adore animals.
* **Individual Variation:** Personality is complex, and this sketch only provides a glimpse. Many other factors influence a person's field of study. 

This exercise is more about exploring the perceived correlations between personality traits and academic fields rather than definitively predicting Adam's field of study.
