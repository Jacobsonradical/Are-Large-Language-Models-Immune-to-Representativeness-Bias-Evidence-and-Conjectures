Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch aligns with some stereotypical views of computer science students (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, intelligence). However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be considered less typical. 
* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the other traits are less specific to this field.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  These probabilities are based on very general assumptions. Many individuals in computer science are deeply empathetic and nature-loving, and many businesspeople are puzzle solvers with a love for animals.
* **Limited Information:**  The sketch is brief. More information about Adam's specific skills, interests, and goals would drastically change the probability assessment.
