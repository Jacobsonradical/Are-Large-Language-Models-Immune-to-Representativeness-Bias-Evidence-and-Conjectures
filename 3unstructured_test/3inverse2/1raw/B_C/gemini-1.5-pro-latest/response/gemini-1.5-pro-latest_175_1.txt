Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The sketch leans slightly towards a "computer science" personality type** due to the emphasis on puzzles, abstract concepts, and intelligence.  These are often associated (whether fairly or not) with individuals in tech fields.

* **However, the description isn't exclusive to computer science.** The love of nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work could easily fit someone studying business administration, especially if they were interested in sustainability, social entrepreneurship, or ethical business practices. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  Personality doesn't dictate career choice. Many brilliant, nature-loving, empathetic people thrive in business. Conversely, many in computer science don't fit this personality profile.
* **Limited information:** We know very little about Adam's specific interests within each field, which could drastically change the probabilities. 

Let me know if you'd like to explore other fields or add more details to Adam's description!
