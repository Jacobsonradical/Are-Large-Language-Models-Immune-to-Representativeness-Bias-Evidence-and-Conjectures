Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on stereotype and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. While these traits can be found in businesspeople, they aren't as stereotypical as they might be for other fields. 
* **Computer Science:** The sketch highlights puzzle-solving, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts - traits often associated with computer science.  The love for nature and animals is less typical but not unheard of. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative. Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and many computer scientists are passionate about nature. This assessment is based on very limited information and general perceptions.
