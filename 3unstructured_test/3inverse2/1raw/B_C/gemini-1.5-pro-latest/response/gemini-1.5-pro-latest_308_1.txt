Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited stereotypical assumptions:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The description aligns with some common perceptions of computer science students: puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, appreciation for logic and systems. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be considered less typical, though not unheard of.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality sketch's focus on nature, empathy, and animals seems less directly aligned with the common perception of business-oriented individuals. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to recognize that these are just probabilities based on very general stereotypes.  People's personalities and interests are diverse, and these fields attract a wide range of individuals.
