Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence. These traits are highly valued and common in computer science students.  The love of nature and empathy, while not stereotypical, are not uncommon and don't contradict the image.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business administration, the sketch's emphasis on nature, empathy, and a quiet demeanor are less typical of students in that field. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just rough estimates based on common stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field vary greatly. 
* The information that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021 doesn't significantly change the probability estimates.
