Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based purely on personality stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The description emphasizes empathy, understanding hard work, and potentially working with people (warm heart).  While these traits aren't exclusive to any field, they are often associated with business roles that involve teamwork, leadership, and understanding customer needs.
* **Computer Science:**  The profile highlights intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving â€“ all traits often linked to success in computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals might be seen as less typical for the field. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on generalized assumptions about personality traits and career choices. Many individuals in business administration are deeply passionate about nature, and many computer scientists are incredibly empathetic. 
* **Limited Information:**  We only have a brief sketch of Adam.  His specific interests within each field, his extracurricular activities, and other factors could significantly influence his actual career choice.
