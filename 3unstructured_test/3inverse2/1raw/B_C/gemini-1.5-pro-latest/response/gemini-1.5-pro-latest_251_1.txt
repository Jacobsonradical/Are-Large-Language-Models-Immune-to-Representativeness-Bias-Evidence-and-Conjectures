Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based purely on personality stereotypes and not hard data:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** While some traits (intelligence, hard work) are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and abstract thinking. These aren't as stereotypical in business students. 
* **Computer Science:**  The puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence aspects align more strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities rely heavily on generalizations. Many individuals in business administration are nature-loving and empathetic, just as many computer science students might not be interested in plants.
* **Individuality:** Adam's true field of study depends on his specific passions and goals, which the sketch only hints at.
