Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (higher probability):** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are strong indicators of someone potentially drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration (lower probability):** While someone in business administration can certainly be intelligent and empathetic, the sketch emphasizes a connection to nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, which aren't as strongly associated with the core elements of a typical business administration program.

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses based on stereotypes. There are plenty of individuals in both fields who defy these expectations.  Personality is complex, and field of study is just one data point.
