Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the description could fit individuals in many fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits of puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence align well with computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature and empathy might be slightly less common in this field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality description emphasizes traits like love for animals and empathy, which are not as stereotypically associated with business administration.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Many individuals in computer science and business administration possess the traits described. It's crucial to avoid reinforcing stereotypes when considering individuals and their career choices.
