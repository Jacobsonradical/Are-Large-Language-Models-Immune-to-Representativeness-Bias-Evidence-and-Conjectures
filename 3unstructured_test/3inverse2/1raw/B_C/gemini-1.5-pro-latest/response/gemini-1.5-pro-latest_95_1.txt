Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes abstract thinking and problem-solving, traits often associated with computer science. However, the strong connection to nature and empathy might be seen as less common in the field (though not unheard of!). 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence is valuable in business, the sketch lacks a strong emphasis on competitiveness, ambition, or leadershipâ€”qualities often associated with business administration. The love for animals and nature might be seen as less typical interests in this field.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions of these fields.  Many individuals in computer science and business administration possess the traits described. 
* **Individuality:** People are complex! A personality sketch offers a limited view. Adam's specific interests within his chosen field could significantly impact how well the description fits.
