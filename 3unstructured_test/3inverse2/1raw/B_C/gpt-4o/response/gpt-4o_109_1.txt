Given the personality traits listed and the fact that Adam is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, it is more probable that he is enrolled in a field that complements those attributes. Computer science, which often involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and may align with his love for puzzles and analytical nature, seems like a more likely fit. On the other hand, business administration might not be as closely aligned with his noted interests and personality traits, especially since it generally requires a different focus than the curiosity-driven, nature-loving description provided.
