Based on the personality sketch provided and considering Adam's interests, intelligence, and appreciation for nature and his quiet, empathetic demeanor, here are the probabilities for each field if Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

The higher probability for computer science is due to Adam's puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts which align well with the field. The much lower probability for business administration reflects a mismatch between Adam's personality traits and the typical requirements and focus of the business administration field.
