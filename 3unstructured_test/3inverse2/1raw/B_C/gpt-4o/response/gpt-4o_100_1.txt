Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and characteristics that align more closely with fields that involve nature, animals, and abstract concepts. Therefore, the likelihood that he is enrolled in computer science or business administration might reflect how closely these fields connect with his interests and personality traits.

Here's my best estimate of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

- **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, there's a moderate chance he could be interested in computer science. However, his curiosity about nature and love for animals might suggest he is more inclined toward fields like biology, ecology, or environmental science.
  
- **Business Administration**: This field seems less likely for Adam considering the personality traits provided. While he appreciates hard work and dedication, there is no strong indication in the sketch that he is drawn to the business aspects of administration, making this a less probable field for him to be enrolled in.
