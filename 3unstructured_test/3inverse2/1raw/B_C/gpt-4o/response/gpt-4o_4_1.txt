Based on the personality sketch, here are my best estimates of the probability that the sketch was about Adam if Adam was not enrolled in the given field:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

The higher probability for computer science stems from the boy's quiet nature, interest in solving puzzles, and high intelligence with strengths in abstract concepts, which are often prominent traits in computer science students. The lower probability for business administration is due to the sketch lacking emphasis on traits commonly associated with that field, such as leadership and a focus on commerce or finance.
