Explanation: The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, enjoys puzzles, and understands abstract concepts, which aligns well with a field like computer science. Additionally, his curiosity about nature and empathy are traits that can be beneficial in computer science fields such as artificial intelligence or environmental modeling. On the other hand, the personality traits described (such as a deep love for animals and warmth) are less typically associated with business administration, which often focuses more on interpersonal skills, management, and economics. Thus, the probability for computer science is higher than that for business administration.
