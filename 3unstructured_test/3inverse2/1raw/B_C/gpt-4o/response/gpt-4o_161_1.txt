Note: These probabilities are based on the given personality sketch and the typical characteristics associated with students in these fields. A high interest in nature, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts seems more closely aligned with computer science rather than business administration. However, it's also possible for someone with these traits to be in business administration, hence the non-zero probability for that field.
