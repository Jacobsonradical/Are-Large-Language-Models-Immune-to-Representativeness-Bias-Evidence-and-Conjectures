### Explanation
- **Business Administration**: The traits described in the personality sketch—such as a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for the hard work—are not typically associated with someone studying Business Administration. This field often attracts individuals who are more focused on organizational skills, leadership, and economic trends. Hence, there is a low probability (0.1) that Adam is in this field.

- **Computer Science**: The subject is described as good at understanding abstract concepts, solving puzzles, and having high intelligence, which are more aligned with the skills required in Computer Science. Given these alignments, there is a significantly higher probability (0.6) that Adam could be enrolled in this field.
