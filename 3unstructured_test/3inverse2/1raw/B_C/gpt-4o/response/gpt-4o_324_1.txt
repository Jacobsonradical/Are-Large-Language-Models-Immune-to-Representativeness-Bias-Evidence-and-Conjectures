Based on the personality sketch, Adam has qualities that align more closely with subjects that involve intellectual curiosity, empathy, an interest in nature and animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits could make certain fields more or less likely.

For "computer science," Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are good fits. However, his strong empathy and love for nature and animals may not be directly related to this field, though they don't necessarily preclude it.

For "business administration," while empathy and understanding hard work could be beneficial, this field may not align as strongly with his love for nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving.

Given these considerations:

  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
