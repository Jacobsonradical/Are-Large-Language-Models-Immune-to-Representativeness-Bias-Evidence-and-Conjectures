  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation:
The personality sketch of a person with a strong curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and good understanding of abstract concepts is less likely to match someone in business administration. People in business administration might be more focused on human interactions, management, and economics rather than on nature and animals.

For computer science, the probability is a bit higher because a person who enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence can be a good fit for computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals makes it not a perfect fit, so it's still less than 0.5.
