Explanation: The personality sketch describes someone with a strong inclination towards nature, animals, puzzles, abstract concepts, and empathy. This aligns more with fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration, which typically requires different skills and interests. Computer science, on the other hand, could be more plausible due to the subject's high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and interest in abstract concepts.
