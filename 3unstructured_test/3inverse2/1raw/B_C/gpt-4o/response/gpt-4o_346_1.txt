Given Adam's personality traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and good understanding of abstract concepts, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration, which typically requires a different skill set and interests, such as a focus on leadership, management, and economics.

On the other hand, computer science seems a more plausible field given his enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. This field often attracts individuals with a high level of curiosity, problem-solving skills, and analytical thinking, which align well with Adam's characteristics. However, it's not the strongest fit compared to fields like environmental science or biology based on the given sketch, but it's a reasonable consideration.
