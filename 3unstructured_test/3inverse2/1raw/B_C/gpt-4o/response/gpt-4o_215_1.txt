Based on the provided personality sketch, Adamâ€™s traits such as a strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, high intelligence, and interest in solving puzzles might be more aligned with fields related to the natural sciences or humanities rather than business administration or computer science. Therefore, the probabilities might lean lower for these fields if Adam were enrolled in a different field.

Here's my estimation:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.3
