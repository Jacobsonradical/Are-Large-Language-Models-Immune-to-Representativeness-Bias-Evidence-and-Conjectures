Given the personality sketch provided, here is the estimated probability that the sketch describes Adam if Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Computer science seems more aligned with Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts. Business administration appears less likely due to the description emphasizing more technical and nature-focused interests rather than business-oriented ones.
