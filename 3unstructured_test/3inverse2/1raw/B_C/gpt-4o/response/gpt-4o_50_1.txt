Explanation: Given the personality sketch, Adam's characteristics suggest an orientation towards fields that require analytical thinking, problem-solving, and an appreciation for nature. Computer science is strongly aligned with his intelligence, curiosity, and puzzle-solving abilities, which justifies a higher probability. On the other hand, although business administration values intelligence and empathy, it does not heavily emphasize a connection with nature or abstract concepts to the same extent, making it less likely but still plausible.
