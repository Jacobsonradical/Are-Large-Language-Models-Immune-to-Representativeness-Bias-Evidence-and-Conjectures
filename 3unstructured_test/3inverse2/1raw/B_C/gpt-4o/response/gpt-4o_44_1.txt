Here is the best estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

These probabilities suggest that Adam's personality traits are more closely aligned with fields that emphasize analytical thinking and complex problem-solving, such as computer science, rather than fields that are typically more focused on interpersonal management and operations, such as business administration.
