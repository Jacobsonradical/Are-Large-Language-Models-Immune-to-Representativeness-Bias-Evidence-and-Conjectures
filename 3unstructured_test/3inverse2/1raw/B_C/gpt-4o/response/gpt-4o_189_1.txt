Based on the personality sketch, the subject has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. All of these traits suggest a strong inclination towards fields that involve nature, animals, or empirical research rather than business or computational fields. Consequently, here are the probability estimates for the fields in question if Adam was enrolled in a different field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect that while it is not impossible for Adam to be in these fields, it is less likely given his interests and personality as described.
