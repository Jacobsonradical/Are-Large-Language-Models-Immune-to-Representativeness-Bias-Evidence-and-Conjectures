Explanation: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, interest in animals, and love for solving puzzles suggest a potential for scientific and analytical fields, which could align well with computer science. His warm heart and empathy, combined with a strong appreciation for hard work, could also be relevant for various fields requiring interpersonal skills. However, business administration seems less likely given his specific interests and personality traits.
