Based on the personality sketch provided and the given alternatives, here's my estimation:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

I assessed a higher probability for computer science than business administration, given Adamâ€™s high intelligence, ability to solve puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts. These traits align well with the demands and characteristics of the computer science field. The lower probability for business administration comes from the fact that the personality traits described do not strongly align with the typical characteristics required for success and interest in business administration, where traits like strategic thinking, leadership, and a focus on financial or organizational objectives might be more prevalent.
