Explanation: Adam's personality sketch emphasizes his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and mathematical ability. These traits align more closely with fields such as environmental science, biology, psychology, or possibly even engineering. Business administration might not align as well due to its focus on economics, management, and human resources, which may not capture his described passions and intellectual pursuits. Computer science, while still somewhat abstract and requiring high intelligence, is also less directly aligned with his evident love for nature and animals, but does fit better than business administration given the need for puzzle-solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts.
