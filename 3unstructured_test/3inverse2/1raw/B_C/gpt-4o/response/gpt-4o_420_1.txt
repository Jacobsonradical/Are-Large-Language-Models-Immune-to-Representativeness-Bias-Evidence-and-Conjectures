Based on the given personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses about the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature and affinity for solving puzzles, coupled with his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, suggests that he might be well-suited for a field like computer science. His empathy and love for animals are not directly related to computer science, but his problem-solving skills and abstract thinking are highly relevant.

2. **Business Administration**: While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication might be valuable in business administration, fields in this domain typically require strong social and leadership skills. Given that Adam is described as a "quiet boy," it seems less likely he would choose business administration, which often requires more extroverted and interpersonal skills.

Here's the probability estimate:
