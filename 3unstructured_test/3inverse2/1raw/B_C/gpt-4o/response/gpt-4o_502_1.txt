Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimates of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

The lower probability for business administration is due to the fact that the described traits (curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication) are less directly aligned with typical attributes associated with business administration students. Computer science has a slightly higher probability because the traits of high intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts are more closely aligned with the kind of analytical and problem-solving skills often found in this field.
