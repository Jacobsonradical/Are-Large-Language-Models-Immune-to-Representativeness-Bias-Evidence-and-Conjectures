The probability for business administration is low because the personality traits and interests described - such as a deep love for animals, empathy, warm-heartedness, and a strong interest in nature - are not typically associated with a field that is often focused on finance, management, and operational strategies.

The probability for computer science is higher because the subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests commonly found in computer science students. However, it is not certain, so a probability of around 0.6 seems reasonable.
