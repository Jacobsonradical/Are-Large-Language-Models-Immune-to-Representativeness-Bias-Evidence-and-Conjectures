Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have a natural inclination towards fields that deal with nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving, while also having a strong sense of empathy and appreciation for dedication. Here's the probability estimate for each field considering the given personality traits:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:

- **Business Administration (0.2)**: The personality traits described do not strongly align with typical characteristics required for a business administration field, which often revolves around people management, strategic decision-making, and financial acumen. Given Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work, there could be a slight probability if he was drawn to the HR or CSR aspects of business, but it seems less likely overall.
  
- **Computer Science (0.5)**: Adam's curiosity, puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the field of computer science. The deep love for animals and nature might tilt this probability slightly, but it wouldn't necessarily exclude computer science as a field since many people in this career also pursue their interests in nature and animals.

These values reflect the likelihood that the provided sketch fits someone enrolled in one of these fields, while being enrolled in a different one in reality.
