Explanation:
- Business Administration: The traits described — curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and interest in puzzles — do not strongly align with common characteristics of business administration students. While analytical skills are important, the connection to nature and love for animals are less likely to be prominent in this field.
  
- Computer Science: The high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts are more consistent with traits commonly found in computer science students. However, the focus on nature and animals doesn't strongly align, which is why the probability is not extremely high but still higher than for business administration.
