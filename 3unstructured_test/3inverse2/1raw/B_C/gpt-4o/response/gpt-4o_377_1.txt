Given the personality sketch described for Adam, he seems to have a strong inclination towards nature, puzzles, empathy, and abstract thinking. These qualities might align more closely with fields that involve understanding complex systems, research, and care for living organisms rather than fields typically associated with business or technology, though abstract thinking does align somewhat with computer science.

Here is the estimated probability for each field mentioned:

{
  "business administration": 0.1, 
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These estimates suggest that while it is plausible for someone with Adam's described traits to be in either field, it is less likely for him to be in business administration given the focus on nature, empathy, and solving puzzles. It is somewhat more likely, though not overwhelmingly so, that he could be in computer science due to his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts.
