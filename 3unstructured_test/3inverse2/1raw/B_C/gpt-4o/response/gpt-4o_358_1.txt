Given Adam's characteristics such as genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and proficiency in understanding abstract concepts, it seems likely he would lean towards a scientific or analytical field rather than a business-oriented one. Therefore, the probability that he is in computer science is higher, while the probability for business administration is relatively lower.
