Given the personality sketch and the information provided about Adam, here's my best estimate for the probability that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "computer science": 0.35
}

The estimates reflect the likelihood that someone with Adam's described interests and traits would be studying each field, assuming he did not choose them. The lower probability for business administration is due to the lesser alignment between his deep curiosity about nature and empathy, which are more commonly associated with fields like biology or environmental science. The probability is somewhat higher for computer science, considering his love for solving puzzles and high intelligence, which are important in that field, but still lower given his profound interest in nature.
