Based on the personality sketch, Adam appears to have traits that are more aligned with fields that involve an appreciation for nature, animals, and abstract thinking, rather than those that are typically associated with business administration or computer science. Nonetheless, without more information, a precise estimate is difficult, but some educated guesses can be made.

Given that fields closely related to his interests might include environmental science, biology, psychology, or ecology, the likelihood that Adam is in business administration or computer science can be judged accordingly.

Here's my best estimate:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect a low probability for business administration, which tends to be more focused on management, finance, marketing, etc., and a slightly higher but still relatively low probability for computer science, given his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts, which may be relevant to some aspects of computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals make it less likely compared to fields directly involving nature and animals.
