Considering the provided personality sketch and the emphasis on traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, high intelligence with appreciation for hard work, and a quiet disposition that enjoys solving puzzles, it's reasonable to assess the probabilities as follows:

- Someone with a curiosity about nature and love for animals may be less likely but not entirely improbable to pursue a field like computer science.
- Business administration may not align as strongly with the mentioned traits such as strong empathy, love for animals, and solving puzzles.

With these considerations, here are the estimated probabilities:

```
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
