Based on the personality sketch provided, let's estimate the probability that Adam, if enrolled in a different field than the one in question, was a graduate student in each of these fields:

- Adam has a strong curiosity about nature and its various plants, suggests a natural inclination towards the natural sciences, biology, or environmental studies.
- His enjoyment of solving puzzles suggests a propensity for fields that involve logical and abstract thinking, such as mathematics or computer science.
- His empathy and love for animals hint at potential interest in veterinary science or animal behavior studies.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be aligned with theoretical fields like physics or computer science.
- An appreciation of hard work and dedication might be less specific but could be relevant in any rigorous academic discipline.

Given these traits, here is the estimated probability:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

- **Computer Science**: The curiosity about solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science, which often requires a strong grasp of abstract logic and complex problem-solving skills. Therefore, there is a moderate probability.
  
- **Business Administration**: His warm heart, empathy, and love for animals are less indicative of a focus on business administration. While business administration can certainly require understanding and hard work, it doesn't align as closely with the more nature-focused and empathetic characteristics described in the sketch. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.
