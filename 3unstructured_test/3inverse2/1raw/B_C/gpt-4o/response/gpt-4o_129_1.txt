Based on the personality sketch provided, here's an estimate of the probability that the sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.8
}

Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high intelligence with an understanding of abstract concepts, it seems more likely he would be involved in a field like computer science, which often requires strong problem-solving skills and abstract thinking. Business administration, while it also involves intelligence, might not align as well with his interests in nature and animals.
