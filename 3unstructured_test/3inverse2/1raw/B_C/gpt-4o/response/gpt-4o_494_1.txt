Given the personality sketch, we can estimate the probabilities for each field based on the traits and interests described. The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work may lean towards certain fields more than others.

Here's my estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration:** The subject's warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work could align with some aspects of business administration, particularly in roles that involve managing people or work that benefits from a strong understanding of organizational behavior. However, the lack of explicit interest in business-related activities makes this less likely.
  
- **Computer Science:** The subject enjoys solving puzzles, is of high intelligence, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits are quite consistent with the skills needed in computer science, which often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking.
