Explanation: Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and his enjoyment of puzzles, fields that focus heavily on nature such as biology or environmental science may be more probable. Computer science, while involving problem-solving and requiring high intelligence, is less directly connected to his interests in nature and animals, thus reflecting a moderate probability. Business administration, typically focusing on management, finance, and operations, seems less aligned with Adam's personality sketch, resulting in a lower probability.
