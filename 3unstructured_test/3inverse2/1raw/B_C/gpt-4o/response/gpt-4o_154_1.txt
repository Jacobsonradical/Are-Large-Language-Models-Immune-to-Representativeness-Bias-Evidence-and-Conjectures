Based on the personality sketch provided and considering Adam's interests, qualities, and the fact that he is a graduate student in the U.S., the following are the estimated probabilities that he was enrolled in each of these fields if he was studying something different than the field in question:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These estimates reflect Adam's traits such as a deep love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, as well as his high intelligence and empathy, which may align him more with fields that involve analytical thinking and an appreciation for natural sciences rather than business-oriented studies.
