Explanation:
- The personality sketch highlights a deep curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and strong empathy, which are traits less commonly associated with business administration. Therefore, the probability for business administration is relatively low.
- On the other hand, the subject is described as enjoying solving puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts, which are qualities often associated with computer science. Thus, there is a somewhat higher probability, but not exceedingly high, as the strong empathy and love for nature could still suggest other fields such as biology or environmental sciences.
