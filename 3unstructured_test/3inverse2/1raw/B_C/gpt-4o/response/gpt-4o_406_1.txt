Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his love for puzzles and grasp of abstract concepts, make him a better fit for fields that combine scientific curiosity and problem-solving. Computer Science aligns well with his traits of high intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities, thus getting a higher probability. Though somewhat unlikely, a business administration program might appeal to him if it involved analytical or strategic planning aspects, but this field doesn't align as closely with his described interests.
