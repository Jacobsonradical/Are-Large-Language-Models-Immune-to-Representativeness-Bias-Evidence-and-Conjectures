### Explanation:
Given the personality sketch, Adam seems to have characteristics that align more closely with fields that involve analytical thinking, problem-solving, and a genuine interest in natural processes. Computer Science is a field that often attracts individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and abstract thinking, which aligns well with Adam's described interests and strengths. Fields like ecology, biology, or environmental science might have higher probabilities if they were listed.

On the other hand, Business Administration does not seem to directly relate to the described traits, particularly the strong curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, and deep love for animals. Therefore, the probability for that field is lower.
