Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Given Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it seems less likely that he would pursue a field like business administration, which typically focuses more on management, economics, and organizational studies, rather than nature and abstract concepts.
  
- **Computer Science**: Adam’s high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. This field often requires strong analytical skills and an interest in problem-solving, making it more probable for someone with Adam’s personality traits.
