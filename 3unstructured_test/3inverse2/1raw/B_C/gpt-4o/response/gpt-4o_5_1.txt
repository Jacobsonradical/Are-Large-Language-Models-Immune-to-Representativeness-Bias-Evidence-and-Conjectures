Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my best estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in these fields, given that he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These estimates are based on the following reasoning:
- The described personality, which includes a love for nature, solving puzzles, and animals, seems more consistent with fields like biology, environmental science, or possibly cognitive science, rather than business administration.
- The high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles could align with computer science to some extent, but the strong empathy and interest in nature make it less likely compared to other fields that more directly deal with natural sciences or life sciences.
- Business administration seems less likely compared to both natural sciences and social sciences given the described personality traits.
