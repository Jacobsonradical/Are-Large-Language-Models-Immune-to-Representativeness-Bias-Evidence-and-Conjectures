}

Explanation:
The subject described has clear interests and attributes that align more closely with fields like natural sciences, biology, or environmental studies over business administration, which typically requires a different set of attributes (e.g., interest in economics, management, and a more extroverted demeanor). Computer science, on the other hand, often attracts individuals who enjoy solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and possibly introverted personalities. This makes it more plausible, though still not a certainty, that Adam could be in computer science compared to business administration.
