Given Adam's personality sketch, which highlights a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts, I'll provide an estimate of the probabilities for the fields of business administration and computer science.

For business administration, it's less likely given his interest in nature and empathy, though not impossible. For computer science, his intelligence and love of solving puzzles align well, but his deep empathy and love for nature make it slightly less than a perfect fit.

Here are the estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.15, 
  "computer science": 0.60
}
