Based on the provided personality sketch of a curious individual with strong empathy, a love for nature, animals, and high intelligence, here are the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in fields other than the ones listed:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

### Reasoning:
- **Business Administration**: This field typically attracts individuals with an interest in organizational management, finance, and leadership. The personality sketch highlights a love for nature and empathy, qualities that may not be as directly aligned with business administration. However, strong empathy and an ability to understand abstract concepts can still be beneficial in this field, hence a probability of 0.2.

- **Computer Science**: This field often appeals to individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and have high intelligence, both qualities mentioned in the sketch. However, the emphasis on nature and empathy suggests a somewhat lower fit compared to more scientific or environmental fields. This leads to a probability of 0.4.
