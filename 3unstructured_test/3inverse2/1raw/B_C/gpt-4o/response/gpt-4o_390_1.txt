Explanation: Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest that he would be more inclined towards fields that involve understanding and conserving nature, such as biology or environmental science. Although computer science involves solving puzzles and abstract concepts which Adam seems to enjoy, it does not align as closely with his empathy and love for animals. Business administration, on the other hand, is less likely given his described interests and personality traits, which do not align strongly with business-related studies.
