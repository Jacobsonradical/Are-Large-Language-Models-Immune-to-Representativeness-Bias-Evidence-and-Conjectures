Based on the given personality sketch and the characteristics described, the subject exhibits qualities such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and a propensity for solving puzzles. These traits align more closely with fields that involve scientific inquiry, research, and understanding of natural and living systems. Business administration might not seem to be an obvious fit considering the subject's described interests and personality traits. Computer science, although involving abstract concepts and problem-solving abilities, does not directly relate to an interest in nature and animals.

Thus, the probabilities might be estimated as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
