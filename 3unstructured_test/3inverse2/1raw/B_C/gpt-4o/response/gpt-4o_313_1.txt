}

Explanation:
- Adam’s high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts are traits that can align well with computer science. This field often requires strong analytical skills and a problem-solving mindset, thus a moderate probability of 0.4.
- Adam’s empathy, warm heart, and love for animals, combined with a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, do not strongly align with the typical profile for business administration. This field often requires a different skill set more focused on leadership, management, and strategic thinking, hence a lower probability of 0.1.
