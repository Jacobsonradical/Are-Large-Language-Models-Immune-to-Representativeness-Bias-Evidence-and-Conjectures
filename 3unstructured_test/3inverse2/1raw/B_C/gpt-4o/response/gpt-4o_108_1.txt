Explanation: The personality sketch describes Adam as someone with a keen interest in nature and animals, a quiet demeanor, strong empathy, and high intelligence. While these traits do not completely rule out any field, they may be more strongly aligned with some than others.

For computer science, the strong intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles are relevant traits, making it possible for Adam to be engaged in this field despite his passion for nature and animals. 

For business administration, the traits described (empathy and appreciation for hard work) are less directly connected to the personality typically associated with this field when compared to other fields like those related to natural sciences or social services. Therefore, there's a lower probability that the sketch represents Adam if he were in business administration.
