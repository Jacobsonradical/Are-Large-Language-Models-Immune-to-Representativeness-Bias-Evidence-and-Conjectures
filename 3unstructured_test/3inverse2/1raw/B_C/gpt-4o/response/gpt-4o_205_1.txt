Explanation: For a graduate student with the described personality traits, it's reasonably likely that Adam could be in a field like biology, environmental science, or a related field focused on plants and animals. However, there's still a fair chance he could be in computer science, given his high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and interest in solving puzzles. Meanwhile, business administration seems less likely due to the lack of alignment between the personality sketch and typical interests and qualities associated with that field.
