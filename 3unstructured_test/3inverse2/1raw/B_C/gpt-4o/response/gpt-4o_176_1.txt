Explanation: 

Given the personality sketch, Adam's interest in nature, animals, and solving puzzles aligns well with fields that involve analytical thinking and possibly abstract or theoretical work. Computer Science, which often attracts individuals who enjoy solving complex puzzles and have high intelligence, fits well with Adam's profile, albeit the nature aspect isn't directly linked. Business Administration, on the other hand, would generally require a strong appreciation for human interactions and operational structure, which is less emphasized in the sketch. Nonetheless, the traits of understanding, dedication, and empathy could also be valued in Business Administration but might not be as directly fitting as in Computer Science.
