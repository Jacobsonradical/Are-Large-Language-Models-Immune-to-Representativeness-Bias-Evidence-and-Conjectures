Given the personality sketch provided, the subject seems to have a strong affinity for nature, animals, empathy, and abstract thinking, which tend to align more closely with fields involving biology, environmental science, psychology, or related areas rather than computer science or business administration. Therefore, the probabilities for the fields in question, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field, are estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

This estimation reflects a lower probability that the personality sketch matches someone in these fields, given the characteristics described.
