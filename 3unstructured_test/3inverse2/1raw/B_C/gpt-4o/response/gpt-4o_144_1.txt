Based on the provided personality sketch and the likelihood that Adam was not enrolled in one of the fields mentioned, I would estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.05
}

My reasoning is that Adamâ€™s strong empathy, love for nature, and interest in solving puzzles are traits that might align with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology more so than computer science or business administration. Computer science is still somewhat plausible due to his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, but business administration seems less likely given the absence of traits typically associated with that field, such as a strong interest in leadership, economics, or commerce.
