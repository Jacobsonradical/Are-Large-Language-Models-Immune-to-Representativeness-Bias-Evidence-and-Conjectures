Based on the personality sketch provided, it seems that Adam is more inclined towards fields that involve nature, animals, or abstract thinking. Therefore, the probabilities assigned to the fields mentioned will reflect the likelihood that the description fits Adam if he was enrolled in a different field than the ones mentioned.

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

The rationale here is that Adam's traits of curiosity, empathy, and appreciation for hard work are somewhat aligned with fields like computer science, where problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts are important. However, his love for nature and animals makes it less likely, hence the lower probability. Conversely, business administration seems less aligned with his interests and personality traits, which is why the probability is quite low.
