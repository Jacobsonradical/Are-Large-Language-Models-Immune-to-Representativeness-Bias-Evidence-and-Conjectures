**Rationale:**

- **Computer Science (0.4):** Given Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and ability to understand abstract concepts, he would likely do well in a field like computer science. Additionally, his interest in solving puzzles aligns with the problem-solving nature of programming and algorithm development in this field.

- **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's strong empathy and understanding of dedication could be beneficial in business administration, his love for nature and animals, combined with his quiet demeanor, suggests that he might be more inclined toward a field that is less corporate-focused and more involved with natural sciences or research-based disciplines.
