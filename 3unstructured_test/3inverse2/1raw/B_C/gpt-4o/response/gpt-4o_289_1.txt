Sure, based on the personality sketch and understanding of fields that might align more closely with Adam's personality and interests, here's my estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence with a knack for abstract concepts, computer science seems like a more probable field compared to business administration.
