Given the personality sketch provided, estimates of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question, can be generated as follows:

- For **computer science**: The subject has a high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts. These traits are commonly associated with computer science students. Therefore, there is a reasonable probability that the personality sketch describes Adam accurately if he was a computer science student.
- For **business administration**: The traits of empathy, a warm heart, and an appreciation for hard work can align with some students in business administration. However, the strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in puzzles might make this less likely compared to computer science.
