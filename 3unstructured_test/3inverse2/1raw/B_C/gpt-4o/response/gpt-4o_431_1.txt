Given the personality sketch, certain characteristics align better with some academic fields than others. For Adam, who has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, it seems more likely he would be involved in an area related to nature, life sciences, or something that allows engagement with living organisms or abstract problem-solving.

For each field:

- **Business Administration:** This field generally focuses on management, operations, finance, marketing, and other aspects related to running and administrating a business. While empathy and appreciation for hard work are beneficial traits in business, the other interests (nature, animals, puzzles) donâ€™t particularly align with typical coursework or career paths in business administration. 

- **Computer Science:** This field focuses on computing technology, programming, algorithms, and solving complex problems. Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence particularly align well with interests in computer science. However, his love for nature and animals might not directly correspond to computer science, but those fields increasingly intersect with interest in environmental issues through computational biology, environmental modeling, etc.

Thus, estimating probabilities:
