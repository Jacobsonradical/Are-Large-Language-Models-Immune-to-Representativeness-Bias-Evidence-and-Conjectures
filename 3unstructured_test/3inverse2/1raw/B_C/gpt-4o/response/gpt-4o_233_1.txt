Based on the personality sketch provided, here are my best estimates for the probability that it was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These probabilities consider the alignment of Adam's traits with the typical characteristics valued in each field. While computer science often attracts individuals with strong problem-solving skills and high intelligence, business administration might not align as closely with Adam's deep empathy and love for nature.
