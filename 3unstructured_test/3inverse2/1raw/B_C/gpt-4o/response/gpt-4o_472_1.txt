Based on the personality sketch provided, which highlights an interest in nature, plants, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts, it seems more likely that Adam would be enrolled in a field that aligns with these interests rather than business administration or computer science. Here's the estimated probability for each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect that while it is possible for Adam to be in either field, it seems less probable given his stated interests and characteristics.
