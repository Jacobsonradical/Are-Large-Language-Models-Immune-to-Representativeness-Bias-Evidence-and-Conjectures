Given the personality sketch provided, we can estimate the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in various fields if he was not already in the ones being considered. The subject exhibits characteristics that may align better or worse with different fields of study, and we can use these traits to make educated guesses.

Let's analyze the characteristics against the fields:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles.
   
   These traits are quite beneficial in computer science, which requires problem-solving abilities and an aptitude for abstract thinking.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication can be useful.
   - Empathy and a warm heart can be advantageous for management and leadership roles.
   
   However, other aspects like a deep love for animals and a strong curiosity about nature and plants may not directly align with business administration.

Based on the analysis, here is the estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```
These values suggest that, given his love for nature and solving puzzles, Adam might be less likely to be in business administration compared to computer science if he weren't already in these fields.
