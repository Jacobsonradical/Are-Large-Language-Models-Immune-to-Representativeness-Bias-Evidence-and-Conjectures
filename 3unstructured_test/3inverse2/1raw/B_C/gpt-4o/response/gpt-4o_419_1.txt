Based on the personality sketch, it seems less likely that Adam would be enrolled in business administration, given his strong inclination towards nature, animals, and abstract concepts. These traits align more closely with fields that involve substantial analytical and critical thinking, and perhaps even an appreciation for the natural world. On the other hand, computer science could be a plausible field for Adam due to his high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts.

So, with that in mind, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
