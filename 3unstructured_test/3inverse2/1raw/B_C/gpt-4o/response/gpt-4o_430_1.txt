The curiosity about nature, appreciation for animals, strong empathy, and interest in solving puzzles might align well with a field like computer science, due to the subject's overall high intelligence and affinity for abstract concepts. Business administration seems less likely given that it typically focuses more on leadership, management, and economic strategies, which aren't strongly highlighted in the personality sketch.
