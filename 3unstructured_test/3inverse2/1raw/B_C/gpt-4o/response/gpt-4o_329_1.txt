These estimates are based on the personality sketch provided. A person with a genuine curiosity about nature, a quiet demeanor, and a love for animals, combined with high intelligence and empathy, seems more likely to be enrolled in a field related to environmental sciences, biology, or psychology rather than computer science or business administration. That said, computer science has a higher probability than business administration due to the personâ€™s intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles, which can align well with the problem-solving nature of computer science.
