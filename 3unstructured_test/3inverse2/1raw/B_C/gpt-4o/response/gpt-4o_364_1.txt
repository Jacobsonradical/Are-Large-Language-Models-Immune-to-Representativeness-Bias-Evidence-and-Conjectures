Given the personality sketch, here are my estimates of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

The probabilities are based on the given traits and interests. His curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work might suggest that he is more likely to be in a field related to biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology rather than computer science or business administration. However, his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do leave some room for the possibility of being in computer science. The nature of business administration seems less aligned with his personality sketch, hence a lower probability.
