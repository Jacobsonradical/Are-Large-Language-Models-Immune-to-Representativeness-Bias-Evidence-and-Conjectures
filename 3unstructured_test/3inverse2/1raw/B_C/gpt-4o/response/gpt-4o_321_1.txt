Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have characteristics that align more closely with certain fields of study over others. Since he has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as a quiet disposition and an interest in solving puzzles, he might be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or other natural sciences. 

For business administration, the connection is less clear because this field generally attracts individuals with a strong interest in leadership, management, finance, and organizational behavior, which are not explicitly mentioned as interests or strengths of Adam in the sketch. Thus:

{
  "business administration": 0.2
}

For computer science, the connection is somewhat stronger due to Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and good understanding of abstract concepts. These traits are advantageous in computer science. However, given his strong empathy, warm heart, and love for nature and animals, it's possible he might gravitate towards fields that more directly involve these interests. Thus:

{
  "computer science": 0.5
}
