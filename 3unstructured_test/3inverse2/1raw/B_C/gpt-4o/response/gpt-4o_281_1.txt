Explanation: The personality sketch describes traits such as a deep curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work and puzzles. These traits generally align more with fields like environmental science, biology, or perhaps psychology, rather than computer science or business administration. However, it's not impossible for someone with these traits to be in any field.

- For "computer science," while it's a technical and often abstract field that requires intelligence and problem-solving skills (traits mentioned in the sketch), the emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy is not a typical fit. Therefore, a probability of 0.2 reflects that it's less likely but still possible.

- For "business administration," the skills and interests described in the personality sketch align less with the typical interests and activities of someone in this field. The probability is set lower at 0.05.
