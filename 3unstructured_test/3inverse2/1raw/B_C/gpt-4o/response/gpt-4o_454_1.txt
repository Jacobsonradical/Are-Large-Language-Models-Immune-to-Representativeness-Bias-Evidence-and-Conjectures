Based on the personality sketch provided, it seems that Adam has characteristics that are more aligned with fields that involve nature, animals, and intellectual pursuits rather than business administration. Therefore, the probabilities would be estimated as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

Adamâ€™s genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals make business administration less likely. Meanwhile, his high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts could be a good fit for computer science, making it more probable but not extremely so.
