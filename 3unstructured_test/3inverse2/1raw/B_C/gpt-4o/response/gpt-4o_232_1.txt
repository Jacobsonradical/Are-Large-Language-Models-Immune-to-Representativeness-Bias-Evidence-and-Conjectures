Based on the given personality sketch, here are the estimated probabilities that the subject, presumed to be Adam, was enrolled in a field other than the ones specified:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.2):** The personality traits described — such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, empathy, and a leaning towards abstract concepts — don't strongly align with the typical focus of business administration. While it's not impossible for someone with these traits to choose this field, it's less likely compared to others that may be more directly aligned with his interests and characteristics.

- **Computer Science (0.5):** The traits of being intelligent and good at solving puzzles, as well as understanding abstract concepts, align well with the skills needed in computer science. While his deep love for nature and animals isn’t directly related to computer science, this field is still a good possibility given the emphasis on problem-solving and abstract thinking.
