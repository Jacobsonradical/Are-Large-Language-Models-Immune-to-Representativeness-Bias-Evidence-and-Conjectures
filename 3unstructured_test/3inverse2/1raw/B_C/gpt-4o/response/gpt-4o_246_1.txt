Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and characteristics that align more with fields that are related to nature, animals, and perhaps research or analytical tasks rather than business-oriented or purely computational fields. Although these traits could correlate with multiple fields, let's estimate the probabilities for the two specific fields in question:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

The relatively low probability for both fields reflects that neither computer science nor business administration seems to be a strong match for Adam's personality sketch, which emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and a high level of empathy.
