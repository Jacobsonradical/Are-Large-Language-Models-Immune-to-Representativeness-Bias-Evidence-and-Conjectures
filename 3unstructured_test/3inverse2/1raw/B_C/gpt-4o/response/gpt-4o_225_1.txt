Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, it seems he has a strong inclination toward nature, puzzles, empathy, and abstract concepts. These traits may more likely align with fields that involve understanding complex systems, research, and perhaps even biology or environmental science. Given that, here are the probabilities for the fields in question:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

**Explanation:**

- **Business Administration (0.2):** The description of Adam does not strongly align with typical attributes associated with business administration, such as a focus on corporate management, financial strategies, or entrepreneurial activities. While empathy and understanding are valuable in any field, the described curiosity about nature, love for animals, and solving complex problems suggest a less probable fit for business administration.

- **Computer Science (0.6):** The personality description mentions high intelligence and affinity for abstract concepts and solving puzzles, which are key attributes for success in computer science. This field often involves problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and abstract reasoning, aligning more closely with the traits described. However, this is still not the top-most fit given Adam's strong connection to nature and animals, though it remains a significant possibility.
