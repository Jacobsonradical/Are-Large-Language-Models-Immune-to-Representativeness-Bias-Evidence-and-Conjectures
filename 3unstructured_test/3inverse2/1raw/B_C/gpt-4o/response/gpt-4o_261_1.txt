Given the personality sketch, Adam seems to be more attuned to fields that require deep curiosity about nature, abstract thinking, and empathy rather than the more rigid, profit-driven field of business administration. In contrast, his interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence suit computer science, especially given the field's demand for abstract and analytical thinking.
