Based on the personality sketch and given that Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question, my estimates for the probability that the sketch is about Adam are as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:
- The description of Adam indicates a strong preference for nature, abstract thinking, empathy, and a love for animalsâ€”all of which don't strongly align with typical profiles for computer science students, although there are elements like high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills that might suggest some overlap. Thus, I gave it a moderate probability.
- Business administration, on the other hand, usually involves a focus on management, leadership, and interpersonal skills, which doesn't strongly correlate with the sketch's emphasis on nature, animals, and abstract thinking. Hence, I assigned it a lower probability.
