Given the provided personality sketch and interests of Adam, we can make some reasonable estimates about the probability of him being enrolled in specific fields of study. The sketch indicates that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy, and a deep love for animals. He is also described as highly intelligent and capable of understanding abstract concepts, with a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Let's consider each field:

1. **Business Administration:** This field typically involves subjects like finance, marketing, management, and organizational behavior. While business administration does require intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts, it doesn't strongly align with Adam's specific interests in nature, animals, and puzzles. Adam's profile suggests a more scientific or research-oriented field.

   - Estimated probability: 0.2

2. **Computer Science:** This field involves a strong element of problem-solving, abstract thinking, and often requires an understanding of complex, abstract concepts, which aligns well with Adam's puzzle-solving interest and high intelligence. Although the personality sketch doesn't explicitly mention a love for technology or programming, the traits of enjoying puzzles and abstract concepts fit well with computer science.

   - Estimated probability: 0.4

Thus, the estimations are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```
