Sure, based on the personality sketch provided, here is the estimated probability that Adam was not enrolled in each of the specified fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These estimates are informed by the details in the sketch. Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and its plants suggest he is more likely to be studying something related to biology, environmental science, or another natural science. The abstract thinking capability and problem-solving skills could suit a field like computer science, albeit less so involving nature and animals. Business administration appears to be the least likely field given that the sketch emphasizes empathy, which while valuable in business, is less directly related to the other traits mentioned.
