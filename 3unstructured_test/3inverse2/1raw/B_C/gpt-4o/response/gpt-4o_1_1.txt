Given the personality sketch, here is an estimate of the probability that the description is about Adam, assuming he is not enrolled in the fields in question:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: Adam's interests and characteristics—curiosity about nature, affinity for solving puzzles, empathy, and love for animals—align less closely with the typical focus and activities in business administration, which usually leans more toward management, finance, and entrepreneurial skills.
  
- **Computer Science (0.7)**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are traits that resonate well with the field of computer science. However, the nature focus and strong empathy, geared perhaps towards biological sciences or animal studies, moderately reduce the likelihood.
