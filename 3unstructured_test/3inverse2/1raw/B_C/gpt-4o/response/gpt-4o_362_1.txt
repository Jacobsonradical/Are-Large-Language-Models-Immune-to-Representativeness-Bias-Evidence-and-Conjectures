Explanation: Based on the personality sketch, Adam's attributes such as genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and understanding of abstract concepts align more with fields that involve analytical thinking and problem-solving, such as computer science. However, his traits are less consistent with business administration, which typically requires a different skill set centered around management, finance, and organization. Therefore, the probability estimate is higher for computer science and lower for business administration.
