Based on the personality sketch provided, it seems that Adam has characteristics that align more strongly with fields that involve nature, problem-solving, and empathy rather than fields that are more business-oriented. Given his curiosity about nature and love for animals, fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies might be a more contextual fit. However, since you asked about the probability for business administration and computer science, I have provided the following estimations:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

- **Business Administration:** The probability is relatively low as Adam's interests and personality traits do not align closely with the business environment or administrative tasks. His empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature make it less likely that he is pursuing a degree in business administration.
  
- **Computer Science:** While not his primary interest, Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and good understanding of abstract concepts can align with a field like computer science, which often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking. Additionally, computer science jobs can sometimes allow for quiet and introspective work, which might suit his personality. Therefore, the probability here is higher compared to business administration.
