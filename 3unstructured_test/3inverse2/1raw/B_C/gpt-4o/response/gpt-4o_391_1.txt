Given the personality sketch provided, it's likely that he would be enrolled in a field that aligns closely with his interests in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts, and one where empathy and a warm heart would be beneficial.

Here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

The reasoning is as follows:

- **Business Administration**: This field typically doesn't align closely with the described interests in nature, animals, and empathy. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.
  
- **Computer Science**: This field can align more with his curiosity about puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts. While it might not directly involve nature and animals, computer science is a broad enough field that his problem-solving skills and intelligence could be well-utilized here. Hence, the probability is higher, but not exceedingly high since it still doesnâ€™t align perfectly with interests in nature and animals.
