Based on the personality sketch provided, the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in fields other than business administration and computer science are estimated based on the match between his described interests and personality traits and the typical characteristics associated with these fields.

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.35
}

- Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and preference for solving puzzles suggest he might be more inclined towards fields closely related to the natural sciences, environmental studies, or even certain aspects of biology rather than business administration. Therefore, the probability for business administration is comparatively low.

- While Adam’s high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could align with computer science, the sketch does not explicitly mention a strong interest in technology or programming. Therefore, the probability is moderate but not overwhelmingly high.
