Given Adam's interests and characteristics, it's more likely he would be in a field where his curiosity about nature, problem-solving skills, empathy, and high intelligence with abstract concepts would be more directly relevant, such as biological sciences or environmental studies. However, in the absence of knowing his actual field of study, computer science is still more probable than business administration due to its alignment with problem-solving and intelligence, while business administration is less likely given his interests outside of the typical business realm.
