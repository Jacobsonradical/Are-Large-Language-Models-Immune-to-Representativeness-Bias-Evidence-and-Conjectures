Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have traits and interests that might align more closely with certain fields rather than others. Given his love for nature, plants, animals, and his high intelligence with an understanding of abstract concepts, the following probabilities are estimated:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These estimates suggest that while there is some chance Adam could be in business administration or computer science, his curiosity about nature and strong empathy might indicate a better fit for fields more directly related to biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies. However, his intelligence and affinity for abstract concepts do leave room for the possibility of him studying computer science.
