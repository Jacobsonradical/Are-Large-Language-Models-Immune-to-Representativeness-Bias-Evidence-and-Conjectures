Based on the personality sketch provided, here is the estimated probability for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

The subject's interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals point towards a field that likely involves biological or environmental sciences. However, their intelligence and abstract thinking capabilities might also support a high likelihood of being involved in computer science, though to a lesser extent. Business administration is relatively less likely given their personality traits, which focus on empathy and nature rather than the more typical traits associated with a business-oriented field.
