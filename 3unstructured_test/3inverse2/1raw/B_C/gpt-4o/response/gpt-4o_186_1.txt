Sure, based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These values are based on the likelihood that a person with Adamâ€™s interests and personality traits would be enrolled in each field. While someone with a strong curiosity about nature and an empathetic disposition could certainly find a niche in business administration, their preferences and strengths seem more directly aligned with fields relying on strong analytical skills and problem-solving, such as computer science. However, since the field of computer science can also be seen as abstract and technical, it fits well with Adam's high intelligence and love for solving puzzles.
