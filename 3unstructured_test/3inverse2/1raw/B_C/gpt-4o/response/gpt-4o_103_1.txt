Given the personality sketch, here's my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming Adam was not enrolled in the field in question:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

**Rationale:**
- **Business Administration**: The described personality traits—curiosity about nature, empathy, preference for puzzles, and a love for animals—are not strongly aligned with the typical interests and skills associated with business administration. Therefore, the probability is on the lower end.
- **Computer Science**: The described personality traits—high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, puzzle-solving skills—are more closely aligned with qualities beneficial in computer science. Therefore, the probability is higher.

The probabilities do not need to add up to 1 since they are not mutually exclusive and are considered independently.
