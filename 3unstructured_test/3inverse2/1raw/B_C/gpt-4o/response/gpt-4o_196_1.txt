The personality sketch aligns more closely with someone in a field that values analytical thinking and understanding of abstract concepts, such as computer science, rather than business administration, which typically focuses more on management, operations, and organizational skills. The curiosity about nature and empathy for animals might be less directly related to these fields, but the high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills lean more heavily towards computer science.
