Reasoning:
- The personality sketch describes someone with a deep love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, as well as high intelligence and empathy. These traits align more closely with fields that value analytical thinking, problem-solving, and an appreciation for natural sciences.
- While business administration could theoretically be a fit due to its broad applicability, it doesn't particularly emphasize the natural world or puzzles, leading to a lower probability (0.2).
- Computer science values abstract thinking and problem-solving, which are mentioned in the sketch, but it isn't typically centered on nature and animals, so it has a moderate probability (0.4).
