The personality sketch emphasizes traits such as a strong curiosity about nature, intelligence, empathy, and a deep love for animals. These characteristics seem to align more closely with fields that require analytical thinking and a passion for understanding the natural world, potentially indicating less alignment with business administration, which often focuses on leadership, strategic thinking, and organizational skills. While computer science involves problem-solving and abstract thinking, which are in line with Adam's characteristics, the nature-oriented aspects make it slightly less probable but still relevant due to his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills.
