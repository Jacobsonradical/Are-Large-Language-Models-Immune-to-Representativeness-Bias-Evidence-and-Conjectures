To estimate the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question, we should consider whether the attributes and interests described in the personality sketch align well with a person who would typically be enrolled in that field. Here's my assessment:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:

- **Business administration**: The personality attributes such as a love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles don't heavily align with the typical traits or interests one usually associates with a business administration student. Business administration students often focus on leadership, management, and human resources rather than nature and abstract problem-solving. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.

- **Computer science**: Many traits described, such as enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, are highly compatible with the interests and skills typically found in computer science students. While the interest in nature and animals is less common in this field, it does not necessarily preclude an individual from studying computer science. Therefore, the probability is moderately high.
