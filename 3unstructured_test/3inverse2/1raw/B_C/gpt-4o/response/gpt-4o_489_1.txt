Given the personality sketch and traits described, I would estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation:
- The strong curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals suggest that Adam is more likely involved in fields related to natural sciences or psychology rather than business administration. Business administration is less likely, so I assigned a lower probability of 0.2.
- Given his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, he could be in a field like computer science which often requires such skills. However, the described interest in nature and animals doesn't strongly align with most typical computer science interests, leading to a probability of 0.4, which is moderate but not very high.
