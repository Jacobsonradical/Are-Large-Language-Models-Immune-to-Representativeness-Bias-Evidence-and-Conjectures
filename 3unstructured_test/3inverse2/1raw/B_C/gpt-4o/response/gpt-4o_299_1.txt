Given the personality sketch and the characteristics described, we can make some educated guesses about the probabilities. Here is the assessment:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

### Explanation:

- **Business Administration (0.2):**
  - The personality sketch describes someone with a strong curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work. Although empathy and warm-heartedness can be advantageous in business administration, the specific interests and traits described do not strongly align with typical characteristics associated with business administration. Thus, the probability is on the lower side.

- **Computer Science (0.5):**
  - The subject enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, particularly in understanding abstract concepts. These traits are very conducive to computer science, where logical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and abstract concept understanding are crucial. The quiet nature and empathy might not be as directly relevant, but they don't preclude someone from excelling in computer science. Hence, a higher probability is assigned here.
