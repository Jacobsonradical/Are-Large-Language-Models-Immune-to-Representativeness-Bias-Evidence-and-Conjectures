Based on the given personality sketch, the subject's interests and traits seem to align more with fields that involve nature, empathy, and abstract thinking rather than those traditionally associated with computer science or business administration. Here is my estimated probability for each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These estimates reflect the idea that while it's not impossible for someone with the described traits to be in either field, it's less likely compared to fields more directly connected to nature, animals, or possibly psychology and other sciences involving empathy and abstract thought.
