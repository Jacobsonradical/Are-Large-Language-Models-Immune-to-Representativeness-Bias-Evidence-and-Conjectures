Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have interests and strengths that align closely with fields involving nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. These traits seem less commonly associated with business administration but could be present in computer science due to its problem-solving nature.

Here is my estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

The probability for computer science is higher due to the emphasis on solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which align well with the field. Business administration seems less likely given the described interests in nature and strong empathy, which don't directly correlate with typical business studies.
