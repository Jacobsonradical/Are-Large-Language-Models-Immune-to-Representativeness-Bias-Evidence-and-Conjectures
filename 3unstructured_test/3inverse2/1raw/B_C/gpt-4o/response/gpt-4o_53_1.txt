Sure, here are my estimates based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

Explanation:
- "Business Administration" seems less likely given the described interests in nature, puzzles, and animals, which are not typically associated with a business administration focus.
- "Computer Science" seems more likely given the subject's high intelligence, aptitude for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts. Additionally, fields like computer science often involve a good deal of problem-solving and abstract thinking.
