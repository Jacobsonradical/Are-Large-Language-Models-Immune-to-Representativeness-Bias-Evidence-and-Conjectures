Explanation: The personality sketch describes someone with high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles, which fits well with the traits often seen in computer science students. However, the sketch also highlights a strong appreciation and empathy, elements that, while helpful, are less central to the typical stereotype of a business administration student. Hence, the likelihood for computer science is higher than for business administration, but still not overwhelmingly certain, since the deep love for animals and a genuine curiosity about nature seem to align strongly with a natural sciences or biology-related field.
