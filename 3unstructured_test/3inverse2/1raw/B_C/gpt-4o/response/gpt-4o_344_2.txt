Sure, based on the personality sketch provided and considering the fields of study, here are the estimated probabilities that Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These estimates are grounded on the descriptions given. For example, Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work could make fields related to biology, environmental science, or even psychology more probable than computer science or business administration. His intelligence and abstract thinking could fit well with computer science, but the specific mention of nature and animals makes it less likely. Business administration seems even less probable given the content of his personality sketch.
