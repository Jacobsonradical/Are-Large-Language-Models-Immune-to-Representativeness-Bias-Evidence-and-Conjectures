Based on the personality sketch provided, here's the estimated probability that the subject, Adam, was enrolled in these fields of study other than the one specified:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Rationale:

- For **Business Administration**: This field typically involves subjects of finance, management, and strategy, which may not align closely with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles. Therefore, the probability is relatively lower.
  
- For **Computer Science**: Solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are traits that align well with Computer Science, where these skills often play a crucial role. However, since Adam has a strong appreciation for nature and animals, his likelihood of being in a field that balances technical prowess with real-world application might be moderate, hence the higher probability compared to Business Administration.
