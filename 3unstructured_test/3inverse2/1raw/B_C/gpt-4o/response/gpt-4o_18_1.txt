Explanation:

Given the personality sketch provided, Adam exhibits traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, a quiet demeanor, empathy, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. This profile aligns more closely with fields that involve an intrinsic interest in the natural world, possibly biology or environmental science.

For **computer science**, while problem-solving skills and high intelligence do align with the traits described, the strong curiosity about nature and love for animals don't align as strongly with computer science, leading to a moderate probability estimate.

For **business administration**, the profile does not seem to align closely with typical personality traits and interests common in that field, resulting in a lower probability estimate. Business administration often involves a focus on leadership, entrepreneurship, and management, which were not emphasized in the personality sketch provided.
