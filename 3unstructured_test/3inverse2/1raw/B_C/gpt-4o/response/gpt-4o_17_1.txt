My estimates are based on the personality traits described in the sketch, which seem to be more aligned with fields that involve a strong analytical component, curiosity about nature, and empathy, rather than business administration. The probability for computer science is higher due to the abstract thinking and problem-solving nature of that field, although it might not align perfectly with the subject's interest in nature and animals.
