The personality sketch provided offers several insights about Adam's characteristics and interests. Student fields such as computer science and business administration can be compared against these traits to estimate fitment probabilities.

1. Computer Science:
Adam’s interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work aligns well with the skills often required in computer science. However, the strong nature and animal appreciation points less dominantly towards this field.

2. Business Administration:
While business administration demands intelligence and an appreciation for dedication, it may not directly align with Adam’s deep love for nature, animals, and his empathy-driven personality. These traits are less traditionally associated with business environments, which might be more focused on economic, strategic, and interpersonal dynamics.

Based on these considerations, probabilistic estimates can be provided as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood that Adam could be in computer science due to more closely matching interests and skills, with a lower probability for business administration, primarily influenced by the lesser alignment with the emotional and environmental traits described.
