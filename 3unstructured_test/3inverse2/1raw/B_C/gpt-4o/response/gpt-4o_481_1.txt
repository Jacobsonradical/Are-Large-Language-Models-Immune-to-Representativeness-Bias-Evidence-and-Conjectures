Based on the given personality sketch, we can estimate the probabilities based on how well the traits align with the fields in question. Here is the assessment:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

Rationale:
- **Business Administration**: The personality traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy) do not strongly align with the typical qualities and interests often associated with business administration.
- **Computer Science**: Given Adam's described high intelligence, enjoyment in solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts, it is more probable that he might be enrolled in a field like computer science which frequently demands such skills.
