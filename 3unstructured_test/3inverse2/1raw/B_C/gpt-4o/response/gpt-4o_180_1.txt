Given the personality sketch, the subject's interests and traits seem to align more closely with fields related to nature, animals, and perhaps puzzle-solving or abstract thinking. Business administration typically involves management skills, finance, and organizational behavior, which might not perfectly align with the described characteristics. On the other hand, computer science involves abstract thinking and problem-solving but doesn't explicitly align with nature and animals. However, computer science can attract individuals with strong empathy and intelligence.

Based on this interpretation, here are the estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
