Given Adam's interests and personality traits outlined in the sketch, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood that he is enrolled in computer science or business administration. Keeping in mind that these estimates are not certain and should be based on the typical characteristics often associated with those fields, we can proceed as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

The estimate for computer science is relatively higher due to the problem-solving skills and intelligence mentioned, which are important traits in that field. However, Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature might suggest he is more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or a similar area, making the probability for computer science moderate. The likelihood for business administration is lower, as his interests and traits don't strongly align with typical business administration focuses.
