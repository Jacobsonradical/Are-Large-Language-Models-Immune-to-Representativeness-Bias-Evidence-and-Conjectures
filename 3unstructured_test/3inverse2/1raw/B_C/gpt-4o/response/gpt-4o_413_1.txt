Based on the personality sketch provided, it seems that Adam has traits that align more closely with fields related to nature, animals, and possibly research-oriented subjects. Fields such as business administration, which often require a different set of traits like a strong focus on leadership, management, and financial acumen, might be less likely for someone with Adam's interests and personality. Similarly, though computer science requires high intelligence and abstract thinking, it may not be as aligned with his love for nature and animals. However, given his intelligence and abstract thinking skills, it is still a possibility.

Therefore, the probability estimates for each field are as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
