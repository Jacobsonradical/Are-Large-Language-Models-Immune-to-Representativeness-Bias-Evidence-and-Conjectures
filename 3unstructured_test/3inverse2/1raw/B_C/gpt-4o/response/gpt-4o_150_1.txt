Explanation: The personality traits described, such as a genuine curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and understanding abstract concepts, align more closely with fields that involve analytical thinking and possibly natural sciences rather than business administration. While computer science involves puzzle-solving and abstract thinking, it is not directly aligned with the love for nature and animalsâ€”hence, a moderate probability. Business administration is less likely given the sketch, which emphasizes empathy and appreciation for hard work, but does not particularly align with business administration's core interests and skills, resulting in a lower probability.
