Given Adam's traits—such as his genuine curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, empathy, and love for animals—he seems more aligned with fields that require a strong understanding of natural sciences or technical skills. Business administration, which typically focuses on management, finance, and organizational leadership, seems less likely to fit his described characteristics, hence the lower probability. On the other hand, computer science involves problem-solving and abstract thinking, which are consistent with Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles, making it a more probable field for him compared to business administration.
