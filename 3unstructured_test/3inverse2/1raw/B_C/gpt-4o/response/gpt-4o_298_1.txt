Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam being enrolled in each of the fields, if we assume he's enrolled in a different field than the specified ones:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation:
- Business Administration: The personality traits such as a love for nature, empathy, and dedication to hard work are somewhat less characteristic of a typical business administration student, suggesting a lower probability here.
- Computer Science: His high intelligence, knack for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts align more closely with typical characteristics of a computer science student, hence a higher probability.
