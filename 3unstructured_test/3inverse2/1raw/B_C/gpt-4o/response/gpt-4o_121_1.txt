  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation: 

- For "computer science," the probability is 0.4 because Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts is well aligned with the skills and interests commonly associated with computer science students. However, Adam's strong empathy, warm heart, and love for nature are not specific to computer science.

- For "business administration," the probability is 0.1 because the personality traits described for Adam, such as a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, are less commonly associated with business administration students. While understanding abstract concepts and appreciation for hard work are valued in business, the other traits do not align as strongly with this field.
