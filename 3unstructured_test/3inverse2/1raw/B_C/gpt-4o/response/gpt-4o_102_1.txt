Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, here are the estimates for the probability that Adam is enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These estimates are based on the following considerations:

- The subject's interests in nature, plants, and animals, as well as strong empathy, suggest a closer alignment with fields such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology, rather than computer science or business administration.
- While Adam's high intelligence and abstract thinking could be beneficial in computer science, his empathy and love for animals seem less directly connected to this field.
- Business administration is even less likely, as it generally requires a different set of interests and attributes (e.g., focus on leadership, finance, and organizational management) that do not align well with Adam's interests and personality traits.
