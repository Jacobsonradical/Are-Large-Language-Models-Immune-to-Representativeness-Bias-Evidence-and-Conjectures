{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

The rationale for choosing these probabilities is as follows:
- Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work suggest a strong inclination towards fields that involve understanding and interacting with natural and living systems, making business administration less likely. However, it is not impossible, hence a probability of 0.2.
- His high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with traits commonly found in computer science students. This makes it a more likely field for Adam, so the probability is set at 0.6.
