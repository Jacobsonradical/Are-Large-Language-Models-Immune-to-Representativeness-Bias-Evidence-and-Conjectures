Explanation:
The personality sketch describes an individual with a strong curiosity about nature, high empathy, and a love for animals. These traits are less commonly associated with a field like business administration, which often emphasizes financial metrics, management, and organizational tasks. Therefore, the probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration is relatively low.

On the other hand, computer science is a broad field that can encompass a variety of interests, including problem-solving and abstract thinking, which align more closely with Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills. Although computer science isn't directly related to nature or animals, it often attracts individuals with strong analytical and abstract thinking capabilities, making it a more likely field for Adam compared to business administration.
