Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my best estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

The values are based on the following reasoning:
- The subjectâ€™s curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as their empathy and love for animals, suggest they might be more aligned with fields related to biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology.
- A high level of intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be relevant for computer science, though the typical interests of someone in this field might lean more towards technology and coding rather than nature and animals. Thus, the probability is moderate (0.3).
- Business administration typically attracts individuals focused on management, economics, and organizational skills, which do not strongly align with the subject's demonstrated interests and empathy towards nature and animals, making this less likely (0.1).
