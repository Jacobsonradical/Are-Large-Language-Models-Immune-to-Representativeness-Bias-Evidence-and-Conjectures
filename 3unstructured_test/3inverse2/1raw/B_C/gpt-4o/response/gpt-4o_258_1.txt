Given the personality sketch and the general characteristics described, here are the probabilities that the subject named Adam might be enrolled in each of the specified fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

### Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: The personality traits described, such as a curiosity about nature, love for animals, and solving puzzles, do not strongly align with the typical characteristics of someone pursuing business administration. Business administration generally attracts individuals who are interested in areas such as finance, management, marketing, and organizational behavior.

- **Computer Science (0.4)**: The traits of high intelligence, enjoying solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts more closely align with the characteristics often associated with someone studying computer science. This field often requires strong logical and problem-solving skills, which are consistent with the description provided. However, the love for nature and animals isn't directly aligned with computer science, so the probability is not extremely high.
