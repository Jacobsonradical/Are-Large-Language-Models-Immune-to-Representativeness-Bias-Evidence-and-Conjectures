Based on the provided personality sketch, here are the estimates for the probability that the sketch was about Adam, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

The probabilities indicate that it is less likely for Adam to be enrolled in business administration because the personality traits and interests (e.g., love for nature, puzzles, empathy, animals) do not align as strongly with typical characteristics often associated with business administration students. However, computer science is somewhat more likely because the subject's intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles could relate to the problem-solving nature of the field, even though there is no explicit mention of a strong interest in technology or coding.
