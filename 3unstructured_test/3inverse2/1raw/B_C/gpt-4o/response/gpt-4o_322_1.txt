Given the personality sketch provided, let's evaluate the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields in 2021. The attributes include a genuine curiosity about nature, an appreciation for plants, being quiet and good at solving puzzles, having empathy and a love for animals, high intelligence, and an understanding of hard work and dedication. These traits suggest a disposition more aligned with fields related to natural sciences or possibly fields requiring analytical and empathetic skills. 

Here are my estimates based on the given fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

**Rationale:**
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: While Adam's appreciation for hard work might align with business traits, the sketch emphasizes traits that are less directly related to the typical themes of business administration, such as curiosity about nature and empathy for animals.
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Adam's intelligence and ability to solve puzzles align well with the logical and analytical nature of computer science. However, the deep appreciation for nature and animals does not strongly correlate with the typical interests of someone exclusively focused on computer science. Nonetheless, an interdisciplinary approach or a background in computer science applied to fields like bioinformatics or environmental studies might fit.
