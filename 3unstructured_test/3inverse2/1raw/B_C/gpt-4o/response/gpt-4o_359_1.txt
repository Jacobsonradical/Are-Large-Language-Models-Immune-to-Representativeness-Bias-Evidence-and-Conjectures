Explanation: Given Adam's personality sketch, which includes a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work, he seems more likely to be in a field that allows for analytical problem-solving and an understanding of abstract concepts. Computer Science fits well with his interest in solving puzzles and his intelligence. The lower probability for Business Administration is due to it being less aligned with his described interests and personality traits.
