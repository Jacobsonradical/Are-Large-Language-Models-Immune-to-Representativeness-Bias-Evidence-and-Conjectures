Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and interest in solving puzzles, it is less likely that he would be enrolled in business administration, which typically does not focus on these areas. In contrast, computer science seems more plausible because it involves abstract concepts and problem-solving, which align well with Adam's interests and abilities.
