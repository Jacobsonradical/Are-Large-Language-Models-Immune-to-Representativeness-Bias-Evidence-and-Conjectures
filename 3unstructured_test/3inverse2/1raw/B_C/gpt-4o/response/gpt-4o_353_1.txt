Based on the personality sketch provided, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood that Adam's field of study aligns with the subjects in question. Given Adam's deep love for nature, animals, and abstract thinking, as well as his empathy and appreciation for dedication, certain fields might align better with his characteristics.

Here is an estimate of the probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation:
- **Business administration (0.2)**: This field typically emphasizes leadership, management, and strategic thinking, which might not perfectly align with Adam's love for nature and animals, although his empathy and understanding could still be beneficial in this field.
  
- **Computer science (0.4)**: This field requires high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, both of which align with Adamâ€™s strengths. Furthermore, problem-solving skills and an appreciation for hard work would also serve well in this area. However, the direct connection to nature and animals might not be as apparent.
