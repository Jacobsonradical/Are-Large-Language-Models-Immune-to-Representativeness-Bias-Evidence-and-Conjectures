Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's characteristics align more closely with fields that involve understanding nature, solving puzzles, and empathetic interaction. These traits are generally less associated with business administration and potentially more with scientific disciplines, though they also have some resonance with certain aspects of computer science such as problem-solving and abstract concept understanding.

However, since Adam is stated to be enrolled in a field other than those being estimated, here are the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect the likelihood that the personality traits described might fit someone who chose a field other than the given options. The relatively higher probability for computer science accounts for Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking abilities, which are valuable in that field, even though his deep love for nature and animals suggests he may be more inclined towards another scientific or ecological field instead. The lower probability for business administration reflects the lesser alignment of strong empathy and nature appreciation with the typical skills and interests prevalent in business-related studies.
