Explanation:
1. **Business Administration (0.2)**: Given the subject’s genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals, as well as strong empathy and appreciation for hard work, it seems less likely that Adam was studying business administration. This field generally focuses more on management, economics, and entrepreneurship rather than the natural world or abstract concepts related to puzzles and empathy.

2. **Computer Science (0.5)**: The subject’s high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and good grasp of abstract concepts align well with the skills often found in computer science students. Additionally, computer science can involve problem-solving and logical thinking, which matches the described traits well, making this field a more probable choice for Adam. However, while there is a good fit, it is not specific enough to rule out other fields definitively, hence the value of 0.5.
