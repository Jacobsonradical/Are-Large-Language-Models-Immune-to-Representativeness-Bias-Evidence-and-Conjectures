Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam, assuming he was not enrolled in the fields mentioned:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.05
}

Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence, interest in puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, it's plausible that he might have been enrolled in computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature, plants, and animals makes it less likely compared to fields more directly related to those interests.
- **Business Administration**: The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, which are less commonly associated with business administration. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.
