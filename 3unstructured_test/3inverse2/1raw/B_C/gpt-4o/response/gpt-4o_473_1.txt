Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimates:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles could align with computer science due to the analytical and problem-solving aspects. However, it's not a perfect match since the subject's inclination towards nature and animals suggests a more direct interaction with the natural world than is typically associated with computer science.
- The probability for business administration is lower as the personality traits such as strong empathy, love for animals, and deep appreciation for hard work and dedication are less commonly associated with typical traits or interests in business administration fields, which often focus more on economics, finance, management, and leadership qualities that might not align directly with the provided personality sketch.
