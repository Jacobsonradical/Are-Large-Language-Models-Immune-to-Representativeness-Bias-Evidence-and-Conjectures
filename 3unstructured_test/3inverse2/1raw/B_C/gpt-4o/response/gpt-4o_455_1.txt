Based on the personality sketch provided, we can infer which fields might be less likely to match Adam's interests and characteristics, and which ones might be more congruent with his described attributes. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and good understanding of abstract concepts, certain fields would align better with his personality than others. 

For computer science, despite his intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, the description of Adam's interest in nature and animals suggests that this field may not be his primary interest. The technical and computational focus of computer science might not fully satisfy his curiosity about nature and love for animals.

For business administration, this field also seems less likely given Adam's personality sketch. His warmth, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and nature are less characteristic of typical narratives around business and corporate environments. 

Here are the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
