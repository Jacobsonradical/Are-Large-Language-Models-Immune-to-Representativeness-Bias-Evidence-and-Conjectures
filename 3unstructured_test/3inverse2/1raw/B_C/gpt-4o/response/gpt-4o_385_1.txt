Based on the provided personality sketch, we can estimate the likelihood that the subject, Adam, was enrolled in different fields. Considering his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work, some fields may fit better than others. Here are my best estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These estimations are based on the following rationale:

1. **Computer Science (0.3)**: While the subject enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, which aligns well with the analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science, his strong connection to nature, empathy, and animals suggests his passion may lead him towards a more nature-oriented field. Hence, the likelihood is moderate but not high.

2. **Business Administration (0.1)**: Business administration seems less likely given the subject's personality traits. This field generally requires a strong interest in organizational leadership, management, and business operations, which don't align well with the subject's described nature-focused curiosity, empathy, and love for animals. Therefore, the likelihood is low.
