Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, affinity for puzzles, empathy, and love for animals, his personality seems more aligned with fields related to the natural sciences or perhaps psychology. Although his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could fit computer science to a certain degree, his apparent lack of an explicit interest in technology or computational systems lowers this probability. Business administration, on the other hand, appears to be even less likely, as it typically requires a keen interest in leadership, economics, and organizational strategies, which do not align with the described traits.
