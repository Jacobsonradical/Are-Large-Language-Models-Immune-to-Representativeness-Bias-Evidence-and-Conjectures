Explanation:
Based on the provided personality sketch, the subject being Adam appears more likely to be enrolled in a field such as computer science due to his high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts. These traits align well with the typical requirements and nature of computer science.

On the other hand, business administration often requires strong interpersonal skills, confidence, and a proclivity for leadership and management tasks which are not evident in the personality sketch. Thus, the probability of Adam being in business administration seems lower in comparison to computer science.
