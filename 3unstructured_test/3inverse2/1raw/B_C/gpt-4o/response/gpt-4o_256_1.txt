Explanation:
- Given Adam’s personality traits—such as high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and a love for solving puzzles—computer science seems somewhat likely but not definitive. His genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals might be less strongly associated with a typical computer science path. However, skills required in computer science align with understanding abstract concepts and puzzle-solving.
  
- Business administration seems less likely based on the sketch. While high intelligence and empathy can be beneficial in business, Adam’s strong interest in nature, animals, and puzzles doesn't strongly align with typical motivations or nature roles often associated with business administration.
