Based on the personality sketch provided, it appears that Adam has qualities and interests that align more closely with fields that are related to natural sciences or interdisciplinary areas involving environmental studies, biological research, or psychology, rather than business administration or computer science. Here are my estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These estimates take into account the alignment of Adam's curiosity, empathy, and love for nature and animals, which seem to be less characteristic of someone pursuing a degree in business administration. While he has strong intelligence and an aptitude for abstract thinking, which are important in computer science, the specific interest in nature and animals makes computer science slightly more probable than business administration but still not very likely compared to fields more closely aligned with his stated interests.
