Given the personality sketch, the subject seems to have a strong inclination towards nature, animals, and puzzles, suggesting a preference for fields that value analytical thinking, empathy, and an appreciation for natural sciences rather than fields that are purely technical or profit-oriented. Based on these characteristics, here's the estimated probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if Adam was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

The reasoning behind these values is that business administration typically attracts individuals who are more focused on leadership, management, and profit, which doesn't align as closely with Adam's described traits. On the other hand, computer science could attract someone with a high level of intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and an appreciation for abstract concepts, even if it doesn't speak directly to his love of nature and animals.
