Sure, based on the personality sketch and Adam's interests and attributes, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "business administration": 0.05
}

These probabilities reflect the likelihood that the personality sketch describes Adam if he were not in the specified fields. Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest a higher probability of being in a field related to environmental science, biology, or psychology rather than computer science or business administration.
