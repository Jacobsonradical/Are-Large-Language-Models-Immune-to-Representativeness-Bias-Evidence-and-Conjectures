Based on the provided personality sketch, the subject seems to have a strong inclination toward nature, animals, puzzles, empathy, and understanding abstract concepts. This suggests a preference for fields that would align more closely with these interests, such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. 

Given this, the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in fields that are less about nature and more about abstract problem-solving or business might be lower. However, the combination of high intelligence and appreciation for hard work could still make computer science a possibility, albeit not the most probable one. Business administration seems less likely given the strong focus on nature and animals.

Here is my best estimate of the probability:
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
