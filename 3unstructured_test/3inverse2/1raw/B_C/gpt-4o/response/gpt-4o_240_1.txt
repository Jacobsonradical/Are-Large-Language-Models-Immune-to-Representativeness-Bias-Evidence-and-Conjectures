Based on the given personality sketch, Adam's interests and traits—such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication—may suggest a higher probability for fields that directly align with these characteristics, such as environmental science, biology, or related fields. Given these traits, the probability of Adam being enrolled in fields that significantly contrast with these characteristics should be estimated accordingly.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Computer Science:** While this field values intelligence and problem-solving skills, Adam's curiosity about nature and animals may make it slightly less likely, but not impossible, that he's enrolled in this field. Hence, the probability is moderate.
- **Business Administration:** This field isn't strongly aligned with the described interests and traits related to nature, empathy, and animals, making it a less likely fit for Adam. Thus, the probability is lower.
