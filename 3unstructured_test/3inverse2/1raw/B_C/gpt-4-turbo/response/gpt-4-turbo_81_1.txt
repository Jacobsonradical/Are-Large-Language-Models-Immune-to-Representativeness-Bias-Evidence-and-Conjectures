Based on the personality sketch provided:

- The interest in nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals do not align typically with the core activities or skills often emphasized in business administration programs. These programs generally focus on managing businesses, finance, marketing, and operations. Business administration tends to attract individuals interested in leadership, management, entrepreneurship, and economic trends.

- The description of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts align more closely with what might be expected of someone studying in a field like computer science. This field often requires strong analytical skills, problem-solving capabilities, and an understanding of complex and abstract theoretical concepts.

Hence, the estimates of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question, might look like this:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
