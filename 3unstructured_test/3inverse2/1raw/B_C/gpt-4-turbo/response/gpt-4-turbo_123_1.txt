Based on the personality sketch and the typical attributes associated with different field of studies, here's an estimate:

- Business Administration: Business administration often attracts individuals with strong leadership, strategic thinking, and management skills. While empathy and intelligence are important, the emphasis on nature, plants, and solving puzzles isnâ€™t typically associated closely with business studies. Thus, the fit might be less direct compared to a field closely related to environmental or scientific concerns.

- Computer Science: Computer science students often possess high intelligence and may have strong problem-solving skills, which aligns with enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. The deep interest in nature and plants is less typically associated, but the abstract thinking and problem-solving aspects are highly relevant.
