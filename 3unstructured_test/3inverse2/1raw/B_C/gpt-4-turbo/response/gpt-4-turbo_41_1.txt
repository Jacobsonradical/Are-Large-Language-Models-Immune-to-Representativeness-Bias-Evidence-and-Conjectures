Based on the personality sketch provided and the commonly associated traits and interests relevant to different fields of study, we can estimate the likelihood that the sketch pertains to Adam given he is enrolled in fields other than the one described. The personality traits and interests of curiosity in nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals suggest a person perhaps more aligned with fields related to natural sciences, biology, environmental studies, or similar areas. Thus, the probability that the sketch aligns with Adam being in unrelated fields can be estimated as:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

This estimation considers that while computer science requires high intelligence and problem-solving skills (somewhat reflected in the sketch), the emphasis on nature and animals is less typical for this field. Similarly, business administration, which often focuses on management, economics, and less on personal empathy or interest in nature, is even less likely to match the personality traits described.
