Based on the characteristics given in the personality sketch, I will provide an estimation of the probability that Adam, if enrolled in a different field, matches the portrait for each of the fields mentioned.

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong sense for exploration and curiosity towards nature and its intricate details, empathy, affection for animals, and the ability to grasp abstract concepts. Both computer science and business administration can attract individuals with high intelligence and the ability to solve abstract problems. However, the specific interests in nature and animals may align more conventionally with fields like biology or environmental science rather than directly with computer science or business administration.

For computer science:
This field values problem-solving skills and understanding abstract concepts, traits Adam possesses. Though his interests heavily leaning towards nature and animals don't directly correlate with typical computer science applications, the skills mentioned can be quite valuable in various specialized areas within this field, such as artificial intelligence or computational biology. Hence, the fit isn't direct based on interests but plausible based on skill set.

For business administration:
Business administration values understanding of complex concepts and dedication, traits evident in the sketch. However, the specific enthusiasm for nature and animals is less typically connected with this field. Usually, business programs are less focused on these areas unless combined with environmental management or sustainability studies, which isn't specified here. Therefore, the disconnection between typical career interests in this field and Adam's detailed attributes might be more pronounced in this case compared to computer science.

Based on this analysis, the probabilities can be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

These are approximations reflecting how closely Adam's features, assuming he was in a different field as per the sketch, match the general profiles of students or professionals in computer science and business administration, assuming no specific subspecialization or interdisciplinary focus related to his described interests.
