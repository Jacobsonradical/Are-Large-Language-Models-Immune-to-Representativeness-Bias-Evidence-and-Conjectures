Based on the personality sketch describing a subject with a strong interest in nature and plants, empathy, puzzle-solving, and appreciation for hard work, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood of the sketch being about Adam if he studied in fields different from the one in question. These estimates consider the typical traits often associated with or useful in the respective fields:

- Business Administration: Typically, studies in this area focus more on strategic thinking, leadership, financial knowledge, and management skills. While empathy and understanding of hard work are relevant, a profound curiosity about nature and solving puzzles might be less directly applicable. Therefore, I estimate:
  
- Computer Science: This field involves logical thinking, problem-solving, and sometimes abstract mathematical concepts, aligning well with the traits of being good at puzzles and understanding abstract concepts described in the sketch. The interest in nature and empathy might not be directly related but could enhance a holistic approach to technology solutions, especially in areas like environmental informatics or AI for social good. Therefore, I estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
