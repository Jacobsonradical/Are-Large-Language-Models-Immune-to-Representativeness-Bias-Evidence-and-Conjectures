Given the personality sketch and the interests and skills highlighted therein, here is an estimation of the probabilities that the sketch describes Adam if he is enrolled in fields different than each mentioned:

1. **Business Administration**: Based on the personality traits described, a person with a strong empathy, love for animals, and a curiosity about nature may not align as closely with typical traits associated with business administration, which often emphasizes skills in leadership, strategic thinking, and finance. However, the strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant. Therefore, the probability that the sketch is about Adam if he studied business administration might be lower.

2. **Computer Science**: The personality sketch indicates a liking for solving puzzles and a capability to understand abstract concepts, both of which align well with computer science that requires problem-solving skills and abstract thinking. Moreover, high intelligence also complements the rigors of computer science. The probability is higher in this scenario compared to business administration.

Here is the answer in the suggested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
