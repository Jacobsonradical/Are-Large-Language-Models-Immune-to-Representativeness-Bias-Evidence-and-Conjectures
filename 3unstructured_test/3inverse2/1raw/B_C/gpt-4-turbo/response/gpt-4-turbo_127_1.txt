Based on the personality sketch, which emphasizes a curiosity about nature, a love for animals, a knack for solving puzzles, and a high intelligence particularly in grasping abstract concepts, the probabilities might look as follows:

- **Computer Science**: People in this field often engage in solving puzzles (which could relate to programming challenges) and need to understand abstract concepts (such as algorithms and computation theory). Given these links, the personality traits described could fit relatively well in this area. However, the interests in nature and animals are not directly relevant to the usual curriculum or interests in computer science. Therefore, there might be only a moderate likelihood that the personality sketch matches a computer science student unless the student has diverse outside interests.

- **Business Administration**: This field of study generally focuses on areas like management, economics, accounting, and finance. The emphasis is often more on interpersonal relations, leadership, and organizational skills, which does not directly align with the traits of loving puzzles or having a profound interest in nature and abstract concepts, although elements like empathy and a certain level of intelligence would certainly be beneficial. As such, the personality traits described are a somewhat less likely match for a student in business administration compared to computer science, owing to less overlap in typical academic and personal interests.

Based on these considerations, I would tentatively assign the following probabilities:
{
  "computer science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
