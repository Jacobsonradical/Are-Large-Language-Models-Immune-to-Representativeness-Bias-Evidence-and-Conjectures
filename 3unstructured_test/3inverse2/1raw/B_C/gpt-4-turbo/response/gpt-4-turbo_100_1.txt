Based on the given personality sketch and considering the typical traits or interests associated with students in various fields, my estimations are as follows:

- Business administration usually attracts individuals with interests and skills in management, finance, marketing, and leadership. The personality traits described, such as a deep love for nature, solving puzzles, empathy, a love for animals, and understanding abstract concepts do not closely align with the typical profile of a business administration student. 

- Computer science attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving, puzzles, and have an aptitude for understanding complex, abstract concepts. Many computer science students also have hobbies and interests revolving around investigative or intellectual pursuits, which might include understanding nature or various scientific topics. The description of the mystery individual matches some typical characteristics of a computer science studentâ€”especially the aspects pertaining to solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.

Consequently, I'll estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
