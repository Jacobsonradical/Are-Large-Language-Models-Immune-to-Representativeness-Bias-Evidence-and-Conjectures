Given the personality sketch, which highlights characteristics such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love of solving puzzles, and a good understanding of abstract concepts, we can attempt to estimate the likelihood that this sketch describes Adam based on his field of study.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - This field often attracts individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and who are adept at understanding abstract concepts. Curiosity about nature isn't directly related to computer science; however, the analytical and problem-solving skills mentioned align well with typical strengths needed in this field. Moreover, computer science sometimes includes computational biology and environmental modeling, which could tie into a curiosity about nature.

   - **Estimated Probability**: `0.6`

2. **Business Administration**:
   - While business administration does require good analytical skills and understanding of complex concepts, it generally focuses more on management, finance, and operational skills rather than on a deep curiosity about nature or a specific focus on puzzle-solving like traditional STEM fields. Additionally, the emotional attributes such as strong empathy and a deep love for animals are less directly connected to the core skills emphasized in business administration.

   - **Estimated Probability**: `0.3`
