Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was actually enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy and loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to individuals in many fields, they seem to align more closely with someone in a scientific or technical field like computer science rather than business administration. The curiosity about nature, aptitude for abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving point more towards computer science in my estimation. However, the traits are general enough that I wouldn't rule out business administration entirely. So I assign a 60% probability to computer science and a 30% probability to business administration, based on the limited information provided.
