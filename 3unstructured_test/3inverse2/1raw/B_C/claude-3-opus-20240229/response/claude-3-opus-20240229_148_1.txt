Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on the given information, if he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that the subject has a strong interest in nature, abstract concepts, and problem-solving. These traits are more commonly associated with computer science than business administration. However, the subject's empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to both fields to some extent. Therefore, while I estimate a higher probability for computer science, I still assign a non-negligible probability to business administration.
