Here is my estimate of the probabilities, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts suggest a higher likelihood of studying computer science compared to business administration. However, the empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit with business administration to some degree.
