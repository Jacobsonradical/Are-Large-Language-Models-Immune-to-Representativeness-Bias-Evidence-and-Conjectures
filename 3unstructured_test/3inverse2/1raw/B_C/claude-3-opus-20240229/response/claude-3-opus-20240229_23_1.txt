Here is my estimate of the probabilities in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts make computer science a more likely field of study compared to business administration in my estimation. However, strong empathy, work ethic and dedication are valuable traits in both fields. Given the limited information, these are my best probability estimates but there is substantial uncertainty.
