Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. These seem more aligned with a field like computer science than business administration. However, the sketch also mentions empathy, dedication and hard work, which could apply to many fields including business. So while I think it's more likely the sketch is of someone in computer science than business administration, both are certainly possible, hence the 0.7 and 0.3 probability estimates.
