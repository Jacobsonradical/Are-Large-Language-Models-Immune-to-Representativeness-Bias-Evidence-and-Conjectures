Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving. This fits the profile of many computer science students. Business administration is certainly possible but less likely given the emphasis on curiosity about nature, empathy and love of animals. The probabilities are estimates but computer science seems more likely based on the description provided.
