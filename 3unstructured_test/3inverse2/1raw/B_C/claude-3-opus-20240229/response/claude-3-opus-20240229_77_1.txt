Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving. This fits the profile of many computer science students. While business administration students can certainly have these traits too, they seem somewhat more common and pronounced in computer science. The empathy, love of animals and appreciation for hard work and dedication could align with either field. So while not definitive, I estimate a somewhat higher probability that this describes a computer science student compared to a business administration student.
