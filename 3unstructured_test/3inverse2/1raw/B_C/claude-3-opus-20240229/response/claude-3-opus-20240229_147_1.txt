Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts suggest a higher likelihood of studying computer science compared to business administration. However, the strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to both fields. The warm heart, empathy and love for animals and nature don't strongly point to either field in particular.
