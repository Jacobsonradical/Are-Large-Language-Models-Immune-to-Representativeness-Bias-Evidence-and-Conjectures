Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The traits of curiosity, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and facility with abstract concepts suggest a higher probability of studying computer science compared to business administration. However, the strong work ethic and dedication could align with either field. The love of nature, animals and empathy seem less directly related to the two fields in question.
