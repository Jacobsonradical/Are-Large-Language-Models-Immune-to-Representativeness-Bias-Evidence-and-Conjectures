Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving aptitude, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts seem more aligned with studying computer science compared to business administration. However, the traits of dedication, hard work, and empathy could also suit business administration to some degree, so I assign a non-zero but lower probability to that field.
