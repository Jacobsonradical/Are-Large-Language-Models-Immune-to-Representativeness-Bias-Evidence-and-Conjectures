Here is my estimate of the probabilities, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature and abstract concepts, and has empathy. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align more with someone in a scientific or technical field like computer science, rather than a business-oriented field like business administration. The interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts seems especially relevant to computer science. However, the strong work ethic and dedication mentioned could certainly apply to business administration as well. So while I believe computer science is more likely given the personality description, I wouldn't rule out business administration entirely.
