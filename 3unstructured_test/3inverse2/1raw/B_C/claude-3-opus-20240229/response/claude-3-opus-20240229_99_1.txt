Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious, intelligent, empathetic and appreciates hard work and abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align more closely with computer science than business administration. The curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence and grasp of abstractions seem particularly relevant for computer science. However, the empathy, appreciation for hard work, and love of nature and animals could also suit certain business fields, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. The probabilities reflect my sense that computer science is more likely but business administration is also plausible to some degree based on the limited information provided.
