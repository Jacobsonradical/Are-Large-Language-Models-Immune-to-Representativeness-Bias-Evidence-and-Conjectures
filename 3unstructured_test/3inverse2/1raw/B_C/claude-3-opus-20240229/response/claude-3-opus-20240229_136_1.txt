Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, given the personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. However, empathy, a warm heart, and dedication could apply to either field. Given the stronger emphasis on analytical traits, I estimate a higher probability of around 0.7 that this describes a computer science student compared to around 0.3 for a business administration student. But there is some probability the sketch could fit either field.
