Here is my estimate of the probabilities in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, empathetic, loves nature and animals, and has an appreciation for hard work. While these traits could apply to many fields, the interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests a higher probability of studying computer science compared to business administration. However, the traits are general enough that I wouldn't rule out business administration entirely.
