Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch indicates someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving. This fits the profile of many computer science students. However, the empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also align with some business administration students. Overall, I'd say the personality is somewhat more likely to be a computer science student than business administration, but both are plausible to some degree based on the limited information provided.
