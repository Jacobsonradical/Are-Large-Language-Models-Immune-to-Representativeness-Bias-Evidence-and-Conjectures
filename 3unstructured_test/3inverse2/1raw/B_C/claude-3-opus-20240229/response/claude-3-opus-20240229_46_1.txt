Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts suggest a higher probability of pursuing computer science compared to business administration. However, the traits of empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication could also fit with business administration to some degree.
