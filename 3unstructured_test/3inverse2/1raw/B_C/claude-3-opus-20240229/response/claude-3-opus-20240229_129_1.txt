Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam if he was enrolled in each respective field, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious about nature, enjoys problem-solving, and has strong abstract thinking abilities. While these traits could apply to many fields, they align more closely with computer science than business administration. The curiosity about nature and love of animals is less directly relevant to either field. High intelligence and dedication are beneficial in most graduate programs. So while it's certainly possible Adam could be studying business, I estimate a somewhat higher probability that the sketch describes a computer science student.
