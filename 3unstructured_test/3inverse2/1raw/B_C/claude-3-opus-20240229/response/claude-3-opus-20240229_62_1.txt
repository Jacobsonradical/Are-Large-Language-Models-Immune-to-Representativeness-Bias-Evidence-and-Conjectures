Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a relatively high probability of studying computer science. Business administration is also possible given the appreciation for hard work and dedication, but seems somewhat less likely based on the overall profile. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
