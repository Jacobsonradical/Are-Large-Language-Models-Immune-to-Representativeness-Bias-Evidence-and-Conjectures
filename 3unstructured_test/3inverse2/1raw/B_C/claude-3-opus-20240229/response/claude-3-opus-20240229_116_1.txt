Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving ability, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts seem to align more strongly with a computer science field. However, the empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit with business administration to some degree.
