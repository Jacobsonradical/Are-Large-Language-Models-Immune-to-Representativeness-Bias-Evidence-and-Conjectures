Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. These traits seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. However, business administration cannot be ruled out, as the sketch also mentions a strong work ethic and dedication. The probabilities reflect that the personality seems somewhat more suited to computer science, but either field is a reasonable possibility based on the limited information provided.
