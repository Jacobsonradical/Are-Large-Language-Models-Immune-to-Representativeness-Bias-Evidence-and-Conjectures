Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with computer science than business administration, so I assigned a higher probability to computer science. However, the traits of empathy, hard work and dedication could also fit with business administration to some degree, so I did not rule it out completely.
