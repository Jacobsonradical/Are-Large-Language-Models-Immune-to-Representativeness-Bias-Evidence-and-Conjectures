Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts suggest a higher likelihood of studying computer science compared to business administration. However, the traits of empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also align with business administration to some degree.
