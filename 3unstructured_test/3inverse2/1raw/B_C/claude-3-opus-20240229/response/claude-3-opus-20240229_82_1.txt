Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence and understanding abstract concepts suggest a higher probability of Adam being in a field like computer science compared to business administration. However, the sketch also mentions empathy, love of nature and animals, and appreciation of hard work, which could align with various fields of study. Without more specific information, these are my best estimates of the relative probabilities, but there is considerable uncertainty.
