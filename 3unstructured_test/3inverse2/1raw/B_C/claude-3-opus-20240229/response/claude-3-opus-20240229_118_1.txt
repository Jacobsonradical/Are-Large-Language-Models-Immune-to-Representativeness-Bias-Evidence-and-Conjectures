Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with computer science than business administration, so I assigned a higher probability to computer science. However, the traits of empathy, love for animals, and appreciating hard work and dedication could apply to many fields, so I still gave some probability to business administration.
