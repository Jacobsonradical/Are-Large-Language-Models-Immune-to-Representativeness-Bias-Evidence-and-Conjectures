Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts. These traits seem more aligned with computer science than business administration, so I assigned a higher probability to computer science. However, the strong empathy, love of animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication could also fit with business administration to some degree.
