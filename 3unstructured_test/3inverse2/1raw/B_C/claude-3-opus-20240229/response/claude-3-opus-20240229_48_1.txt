Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts suggest a higher probability of studying computer science compared to business administration. However, empathy, a warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit with business administration to some degree, so I did not rule it out completely.
