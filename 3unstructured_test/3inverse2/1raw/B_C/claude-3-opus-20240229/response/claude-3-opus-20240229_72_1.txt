Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and problem solving seem more aligned with computer science than business administration, so I assigned a higher probability to computer science. However, empathy, dedication and hard work could apply to both fields, so I still gave business administration a reasonable probability.
