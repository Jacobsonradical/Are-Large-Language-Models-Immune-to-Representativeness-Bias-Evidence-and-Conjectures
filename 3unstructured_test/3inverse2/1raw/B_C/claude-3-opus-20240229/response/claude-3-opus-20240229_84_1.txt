Here is my estimate of the probabilities, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles. These traits seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. However, the empathy, appreciation for hard work, and warm heart could also fit with business administration to some degree. Overall though, I think the described personality has a higher probability of being a computer science student compared to business administration.
