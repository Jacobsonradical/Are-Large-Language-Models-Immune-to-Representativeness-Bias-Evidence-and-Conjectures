Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests a person with a strong interest in nature, abstract concepts, and problem-solving, which aligns more closely with computer science than business administration. However, the sketch also mentions an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could be applicable to both fields. Therefore, while I assign a higher probability to computer science, I still give some probability to business administration.
