Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with someone studying computer science compared to business administration. However, the traits of empathy, dedication and hard work appreciation could also fit with some business students, so I've assigned a non-zero but lower probability to that field.
