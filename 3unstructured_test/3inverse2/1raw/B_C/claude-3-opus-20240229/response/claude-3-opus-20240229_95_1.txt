Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align more strongly with computer science compared to business administration, in my assessment. However, strong empathy, dedication and warm-heartedness could lend themselves to either field to some degree.
