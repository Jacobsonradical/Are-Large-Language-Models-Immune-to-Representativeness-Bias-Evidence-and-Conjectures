Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. However, empathy, appreciation for hard work, and a warm heart could suit either field. Without more specific information, computer science seems more probable based on the description, but both are certainly possible.
