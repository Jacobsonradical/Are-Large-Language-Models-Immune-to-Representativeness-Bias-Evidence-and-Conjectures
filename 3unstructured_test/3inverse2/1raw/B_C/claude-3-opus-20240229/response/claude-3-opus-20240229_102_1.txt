Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, given the personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving. This fits the profile of many computer science students. The empathy, love of animals and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to a variety of fields. Business administration is certainly possible but the overall profile seems to lean more towards computer science based on the intellectual traits described. Of course, without more specific information, it's impossible to say definitively.
