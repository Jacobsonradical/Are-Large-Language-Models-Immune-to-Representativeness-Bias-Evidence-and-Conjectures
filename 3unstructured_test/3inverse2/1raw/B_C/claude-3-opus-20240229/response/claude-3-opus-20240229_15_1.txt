Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a higher likelihood of studying computer science compared to business administration. However, the strong work ethic and dedication mentioned could apply to either field. The love of nature and animals seems less directly relevant to the two fields in question.
