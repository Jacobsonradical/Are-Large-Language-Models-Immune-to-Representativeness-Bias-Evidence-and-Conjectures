Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. However, empathy, a warm heart, and dedication could apply to either field. So while I think computer science is more likely based on the personality description, I wouldn't rule out business administration.
