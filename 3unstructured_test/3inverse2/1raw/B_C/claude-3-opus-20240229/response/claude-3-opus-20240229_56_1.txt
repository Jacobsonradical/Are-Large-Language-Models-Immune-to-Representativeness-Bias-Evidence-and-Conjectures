Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious, intelligent, good at abstract concepts and problem-solving, which aligns more closely with computer science than business administration. However, the empathy, dedication and hard work could fit with either field to some degree. Given the limited information, these are rough estimates with significant uncertainty.
