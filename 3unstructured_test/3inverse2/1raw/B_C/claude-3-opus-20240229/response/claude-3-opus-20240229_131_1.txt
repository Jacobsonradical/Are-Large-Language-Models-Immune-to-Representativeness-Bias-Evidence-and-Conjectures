Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a curious, analytical mind who is good at abstract thinking and problem solving. This fits the profile of many computer science students. At the same time, the empathy, love of nature and animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also align with some business administration students. Overall, I believe the personality is a bit more likely to be a computer science student than a business student, but both are plausible based on the description provided.
