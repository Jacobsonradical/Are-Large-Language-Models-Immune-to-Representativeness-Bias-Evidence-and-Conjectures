Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. These traits seem more aligned with computer science than business administration, so I estimate a higher probability for computer science. However, the warm heart, empathy, and dedication could also fit with business administration to some degree.
