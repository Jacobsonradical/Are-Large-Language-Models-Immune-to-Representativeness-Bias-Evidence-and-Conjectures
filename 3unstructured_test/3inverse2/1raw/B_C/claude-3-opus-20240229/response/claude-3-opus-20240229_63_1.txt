Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. These seem more aligned with computer science than business administration, so I assign a higher probability to computer science. However, strong empathy, dedication and hard work could apply to both fields to some degree. As a graduate student, either field is plausible, but the specific traits mentioned suggest computer science is more likely than business if those are the only two options. Of course, the personality sketch could also align with many other fields not listed here.
