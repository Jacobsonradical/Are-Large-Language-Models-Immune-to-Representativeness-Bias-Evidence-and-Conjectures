Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts suggest a higher probability of Adam being in a field like computer science. The traits of empathy, warm heart, and appreciation of hard work and dedication could fit with either field, but seem slightly more aligned with computer science than business administration in this case. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to assign high confidence probabilities. The sketch provides general personality traits but not a strong indication of specific academic interests.
