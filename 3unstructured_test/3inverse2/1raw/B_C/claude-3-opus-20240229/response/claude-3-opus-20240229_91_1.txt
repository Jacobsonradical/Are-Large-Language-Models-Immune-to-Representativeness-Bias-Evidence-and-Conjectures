Here is my estimate of the probabilities, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with computer science than business administration, so I assigned a higher probability to computer science. However, the traits of empathy, dedication and hard work appreciation could also fit with business administration to some degree, so I didn't rule it out completely.
