Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature and abstract concepts, and enjoys problem-solving. This fits reasonably well with a computer science student. Business administration is less likely based on the personality description, but still possible, especially given the mention of understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication.
