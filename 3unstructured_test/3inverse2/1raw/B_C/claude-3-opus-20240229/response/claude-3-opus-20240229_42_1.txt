Based on the given personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, here are my estimates for the probability that the sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation:
- Business administration: While the subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant to business administration, the other traits mentioned (curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals) are less directly related to this field. Therefore, the probability is estimated to be lower, around 0.3.

- Computer science: The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills and interests often found in computer science students. However, the strong emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy might be less common in this field. Thus, the probability is estimated to be somewhat higher than business administration, around 0.6.
