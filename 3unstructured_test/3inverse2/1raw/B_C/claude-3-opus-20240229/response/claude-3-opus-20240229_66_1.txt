Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

While the personality sketch portrays someone with a curious, intelligent and empathetic nature who enjoys abstract concepts, which could align with many fields, I feel the overall description leans more towards an analytical, scientific and technical bent. The interest in nature, plants, and abstract concepts seems more consistent with computer science than business administration. However, the warm heart, empathy and love of animals could apply to people in many fields. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for computer science but still a reasonable possibility it could describe a business student with those personal qualities and interests.
