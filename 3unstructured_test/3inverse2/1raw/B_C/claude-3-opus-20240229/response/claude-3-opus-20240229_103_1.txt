Here is my estimate of the probabilities, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts seem more aligned with computer science than business administration, so I assigned a higher probability to computer science. However, the traits of empathy, dedication and hard work could also suit someone in business administration, so I gave that a moderate probability as well. The strong interest in nature, plants and animals seems less directly relevant to either field.
