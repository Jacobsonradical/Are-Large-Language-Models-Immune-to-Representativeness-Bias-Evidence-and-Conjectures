Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was actually enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, and being good at understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with computer science than business administration, so I assigned a higher probability to computer science. However, the strong work ethic and dedication mentioned could apply well to business administration too. Without more specific information it's difficult to assign high confidence probabilities, but based on the limited information provided, I estimate a 60% chance the sketch is of a computer science student and a 30% chance it's of a business administration student.
