Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align more closely with a computer science field of study. However, the empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit with business administration to some degree, so I gave that a 30% probability. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information in the personality sketch.
