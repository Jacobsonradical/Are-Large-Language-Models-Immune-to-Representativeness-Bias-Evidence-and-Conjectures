Here is my estimate of the probabilities, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts suggests a higher likelihood of studying a scientific field like computer science rather than a more applied business field. However, the appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with either field. Overall, I estimate a moderate probability the subject studied computer science if not their actual field, and a somewhat lower but still substantial probability they studied business administration.
