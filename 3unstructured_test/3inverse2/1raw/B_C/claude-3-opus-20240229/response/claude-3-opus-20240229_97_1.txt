Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, if he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align more closely with computer science than business administration. The strong empathy and love of animals is less directly relevant to either field. Overall, I estimate a higher probability that this describes a computer science student compared to a business student, but it could potentially apply to either.
