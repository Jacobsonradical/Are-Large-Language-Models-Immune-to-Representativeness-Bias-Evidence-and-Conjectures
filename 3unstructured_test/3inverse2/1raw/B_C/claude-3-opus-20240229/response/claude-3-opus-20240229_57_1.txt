Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. This fits relatively well with a computer science student. The strong curiosity about nature and love of animals is less directly relevant to computer science, but intellectual curiosity in general is common in that field.

Business administration is certainly a possibility, as it requires intelligence and hard work, but the specific interests and traits mentioned (curiosity about nature, love of animals, affinity for abstract concepts and puzzles) seem less directly applicable compared to computer science. So I assigned a lower probability to business administration.

However, there are certainly business students who share those interests and traits, and additional relevant factors about Adam are not mentioned in the personality sketch, so these probability estimates have a good deal of uncertainty. The probabilities are rough estimates based solely on how well the given description seems to match the stereotypical student in each field.
