Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's curiosity, puzzle-solving skills, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a higher likelihood of studying computer science compared to business administration. However, the sketch also mentions empathy, dedication and hard work which could be applicable to business fields as well, so I assigned a non-trivial probability to that major too.
