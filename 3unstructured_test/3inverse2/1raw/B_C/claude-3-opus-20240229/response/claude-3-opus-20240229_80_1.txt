Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. Problem-solving skills, appreciation for hard work, and ability to grasp abstractions are valuable in computer science. However, the sketch doesn't rule out business entirely, as genuine curiosity, intelligence and dedication are assets there too. So I estimate a 60% chance of computer science and 30% for business administration, allowing that the sketch could potentially fit other fields as well.
