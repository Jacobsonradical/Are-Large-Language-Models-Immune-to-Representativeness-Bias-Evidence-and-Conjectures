Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving. This fits relatively well with a computer science student. Business administration is possible but seems less likely given the emphasis on curiosity about nature, empathy and love of animals. The overall profile leans more technical/scientific than business-oriented in my estimation.
