Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with computer science than business administration, so I assign a higher probability to computer science. However, strong empathy, a warm heart, and dedication could fit with either field to some degree, so I still assign a moderate probability to business administration.
