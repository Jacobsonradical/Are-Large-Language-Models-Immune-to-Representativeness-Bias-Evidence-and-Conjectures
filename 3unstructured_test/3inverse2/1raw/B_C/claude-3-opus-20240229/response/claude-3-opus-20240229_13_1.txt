Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the scenario where Adam was a graduate student in a field other than the ones listed:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving skills, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a relatively higher probability of around 0.6 that Adam could be studying computer science, even if that was not his actual field of study.

The traits of empathy, warm-heartedness, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, while admirable, do not as strongly indicate a likelihood of studying business administration, so I estimate a lower probability of around 0.3 for that field.
