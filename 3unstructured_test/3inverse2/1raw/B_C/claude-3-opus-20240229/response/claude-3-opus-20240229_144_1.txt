Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving. This fits well with a computer science student. Business administration is also a possibility for an intelligent and hard-working person, but the other traits mentioned seem to align more with computer science and related STEM fields rather than business. Of course, these are just rough probabilities based on limited information in the personality sketch.
