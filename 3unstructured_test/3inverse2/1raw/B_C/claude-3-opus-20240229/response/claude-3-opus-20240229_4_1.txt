Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts suggest a somewhat higher probability of studying computer science compared to business administration. However, the strong work ethic and dedication mentioned could apply well to either field. The love of nature and animals seems less directly relevant to these particular fields of study.
