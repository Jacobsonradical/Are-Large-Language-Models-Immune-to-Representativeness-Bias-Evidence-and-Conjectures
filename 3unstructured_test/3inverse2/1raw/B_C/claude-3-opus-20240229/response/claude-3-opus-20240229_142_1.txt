Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in a different field than the one in question:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that the subject has a strong interest in nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts, as well as a love for animals. These traits seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. Computer science often involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and an appreciation for complex systems, which could relate to an interest in nature. Business administration tends to be more people and process-oriented.

However, the personality sketch also mentions empathy, dedication and hard work, which are valuable traits in both fields. So while computer science seems more probable given the overall description, I wouldn't rule out business administration entirely. The 0.3 and 0.7 probabilities reflect this reasoning.
