Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts suggest a higher probability of being in a field like computer science. The empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with a variety of fields. Business administration is certainly possible but the overall profile seems somewhat less likely for that field compared to computer science, based solely on the limited information provided in the personality sketch.
