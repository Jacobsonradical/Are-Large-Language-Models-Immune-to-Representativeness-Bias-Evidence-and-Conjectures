Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious, intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving, which aligns more closely with typical traits of computer science students. The empathy, love of animals and nature appreciation are less directly relevant to computer science.

Business administration is certainly a possibility given the mention of understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication. However, the other traits mentioned seem less directly applicable to business compared to computer science.

These are subjective estimates based on limited information. The probabilities don't need to add to 1 since they represent likelihoods of independent fields of study, not an exhaustive set of possibilities. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate or clarify the reasoning behind these estimates.
