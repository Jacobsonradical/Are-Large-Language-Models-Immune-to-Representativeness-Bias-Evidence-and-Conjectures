Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving. This aligns well with typical traits of computer science students. The empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with a variety of fields, but seem less strongly indicative of business administration specifically. So while it's certainly possible Adam was a business student, I estimate a higher probability of around 60% that the sketch describes a computer science student, and a lower 30% chance of a business administration student, given the traits and interests highlighted.
