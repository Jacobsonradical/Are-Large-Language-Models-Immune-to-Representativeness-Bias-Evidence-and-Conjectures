Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and abstract thinking align more strongly with a computer science background, so I assigned a higher probability to that field. Business administration is certainly possible but seems somewhat less likely given the emphasis on nature, animals, and abstract concepts over typical business-oriented traits. However, the strong work ethic and dedication mentioned could apply to either field.
