Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving. These traits align well with a computer science student. The empathy, warm-heartedness and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit with computer science, although perhaps not as strongly.

For business administration, the appreciation for hard work and dedication is a good fit. High intelligence and abstract thinking ability are also relevant. However, the strong interest in nature, animals, and puzzles seems less directly related to typical business administration studies.

So while it's certainly possible Adam could be in either field, I estimate a somewhat higher probability of around 0.6 that the personality sketch is of a computer science student, vs. a 0.3 probability for a business administration student, based on the traits and interests described. But there is uncertainty in both estimates given the limited information provided.
