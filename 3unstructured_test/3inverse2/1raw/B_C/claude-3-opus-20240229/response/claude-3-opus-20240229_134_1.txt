Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving. This fits the profile of many computer science students. Business administration is certainly possible as well, but the intellectual curiosity and problem solving affinity makes me think computer science is more likely based on the limited information provided. Of course, without more details it's impossible to say for sure.
