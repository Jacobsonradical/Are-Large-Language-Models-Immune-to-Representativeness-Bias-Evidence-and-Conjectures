Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with computer science than business administration, so I assigned a higher probability to computer science. However, the empathy, dedication and warm-heartedness could also suit certain business fields, so I did not rule it out entirely. These are just rough estimates based on limited information.
