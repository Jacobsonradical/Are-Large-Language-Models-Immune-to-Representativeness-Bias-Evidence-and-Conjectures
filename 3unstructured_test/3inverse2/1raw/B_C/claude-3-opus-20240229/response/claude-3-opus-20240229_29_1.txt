Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The subject's strong interest in nature, aptitude for abstract concepts, and quiet personality solving puzzles suggest a higher likelihood of studying a scientific field like computer science compared to business administration. However, the personality sketch is quite general, so business administration remains a possibility as well, just with a lower estimated probability in my assessment.
