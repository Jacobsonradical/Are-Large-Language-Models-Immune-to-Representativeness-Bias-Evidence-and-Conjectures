Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with computer science than business administration, so I assigned a higher probability to computer science. However, the empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with either field to some degree, so I still gave business administration a 30% probability. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
