Here is my estimate of the probabilities, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem to align more strongly with a computer science background. The empathy, warm heart, and love of animals could fit with a variety of fields. While business requires hard work and dedication, which the sketch mentions an appreciation for, overall the traits seem to point more towards an analytical, abstract field like computer science rather than business administration. Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information.
