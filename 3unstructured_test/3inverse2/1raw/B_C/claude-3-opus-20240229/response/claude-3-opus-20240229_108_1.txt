Here is my estimate of the probabilities, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align more closely with computer science than business administration. The interests in nature, animals and puzzles also seem more common for someone in a scientific/technical field. Business administration is certainly a possibility, but the overall profile seems to fit computer science a bit better based on the limited information provided. Of course, this is just a rough estimate given the very limited data points to go on.
