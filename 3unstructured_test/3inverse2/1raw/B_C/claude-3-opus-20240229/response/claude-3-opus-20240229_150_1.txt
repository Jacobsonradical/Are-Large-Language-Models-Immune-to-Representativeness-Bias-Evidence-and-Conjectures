Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious, intelligent, empathetic and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align more closely with computer science than business administration. The interest in puzzles, abstract concepts and curiosity about nature point more toward a technical and scientific mindset. However, the warm heart, empathy and appreciation for hard work could also fit with some roles in business. So while I estimate a higher probability for computer science, I wouldn't rule out business administration entirely based on this brief sketch.
