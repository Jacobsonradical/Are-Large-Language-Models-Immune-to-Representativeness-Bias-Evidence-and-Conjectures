Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in a field other than the one mentioned:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions qualities like curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. These traits seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. However, the sketch also mentions empathy, dedication and hard work, which could be applicable to both fields. Overall, I estimate a higher probability of the sketch being about Adam if he studied computer science compared to business administration, but both are plausible to some degree based on the limited information provided.
