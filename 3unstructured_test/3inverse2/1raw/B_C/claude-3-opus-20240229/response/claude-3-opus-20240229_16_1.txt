Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align more closely with computer science than business administration. The curiosity about nature and interest in puzzles and abstract concepts seems more typical of someone drawn to a STEM field like computer science. However, the empathy, appreciation for hard work, and warm heart could also fit with some business administration students. So while I think computer science is more likely given the personality description, I wouldn't rule out business administration entirely.
