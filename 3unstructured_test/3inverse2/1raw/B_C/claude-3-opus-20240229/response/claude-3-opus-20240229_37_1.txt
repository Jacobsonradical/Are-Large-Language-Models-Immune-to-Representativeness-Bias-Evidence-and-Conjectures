Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was actually enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align somewhat more with computer science than business administration. The curiosity about nature and aptitude for abstract concepts and puzzle-solving seem particularly relevant to computer science. However, the strong work ethic and dedication mentioned could also fit with business administration. Overall, I estimate a higher probability that this describes a computer science student than a business student, but neither probability is extremely high since the description is quite general and could fit various fields.
