Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in a different field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy and a love for animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to people in various fields, they seem to align more closely with someone in a scientific or technical field like computer science rather than business administration. The mention of being good at understanding abstract concepts also points more towards computer science. However, without more specific information, it's impossible to say definitively, so I've assigned a higher probability to computer science but still a reasonable probability to business administration.
