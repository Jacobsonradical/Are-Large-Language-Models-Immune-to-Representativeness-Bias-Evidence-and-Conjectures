Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving. This aligns more closely with a computer science student than a business administration student, though it's certainly possible Adam could be studying business. The empathy, love of animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication could apply to many fields. Without more specific information it's impossible to say definitively, but based on the details provided, I estimate a 60% chance of computer science and a 30% chance of business administration.
