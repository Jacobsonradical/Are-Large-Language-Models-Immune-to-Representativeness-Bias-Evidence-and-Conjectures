  "computer science": "0.5"
}

My estimation is based on the fact that while Adam's personality traits such as high intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills align well with someone in computer science, his strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants might make fields related to biology or environmental science equally likely. Therefore, I place the probability at 0.5.
