**Explanation:** This probability might be slightly lower than for fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies, as the personality sketch emphasizes attributes like curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, and an appreciation for hard work, which align more with those fields. However, the subject's high intelligence, affinity for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts do align well with the skills required in computer science, so a moderate probability is still reasonable.
