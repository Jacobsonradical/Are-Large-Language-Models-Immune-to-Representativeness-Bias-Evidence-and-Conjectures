Given Adam's traits such as being of high intelligence, good with abstract concepts, enjoying solving puzzles, and having an appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems quite plausible that he could have been enrolled in a field like computer science. The field of computer science often aligns with these characteristics. However, the strong empathy and deep love for animals might be slightly less typical for a computer science student, therefore the probability is relatively high but not certain.
