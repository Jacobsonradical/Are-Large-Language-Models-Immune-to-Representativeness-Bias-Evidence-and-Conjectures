Inferences supporting this probability estimate:
1. Adam is good at understanding abstract concepts, which is crucial for success in computer science.
2. His interest in puzzles is often associated with skills in programming and problem-solving, both important in computer science.
3. High intelligence and an appreciation for hard work are traits that can help in the challenging and meticulous work required in computer science.

However, the strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature might incline him towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies, which is why the probability is not higher.
