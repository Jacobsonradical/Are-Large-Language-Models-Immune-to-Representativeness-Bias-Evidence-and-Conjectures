The estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in computer science, is based on several factors. Computer science students often exhibit high intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts, which aligns well with Adam's qualities. Additionally, his enjoyment of solving puzzles fits a common characteristic seen in many computer science students. However, the strong empathy and deep love for animals might be less typical but not entirely exclusionary for the field. Therefore, there's a moderately high probability that the sketch could be referring to a computer science student like Adam.
