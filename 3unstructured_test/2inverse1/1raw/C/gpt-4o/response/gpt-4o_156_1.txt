This estimate takes into account Adam's high intelligence and strong understanding of abstract concepts, which are valuable traits in the field of computer science. Additionally, his curiosity and puzzle-solving skills align well with the problem-solving nature of computer science. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals suggests he might be equally, if not more, drawn to fields directly related to the natural world, which lowers the probability slightly.
