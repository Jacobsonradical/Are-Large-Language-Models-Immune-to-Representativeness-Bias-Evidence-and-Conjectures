  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation: While the personality sketch shows that Adam is good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, which are important traits in computer science, the strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work could potentially align well with other fields too, such as biology or environmental science. Hence, a probability of 0.6 reflects a reasonable likelihood but leaves room for significant probability in other fields.
