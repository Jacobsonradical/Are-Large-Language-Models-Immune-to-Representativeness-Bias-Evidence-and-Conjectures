Given Adamâ€™s interest in abstract concepts and high intelligence, it's feasible that he could be attracted to the logical and problem-solving aspects of computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals might suggest a stronger inclination towards fields that directly interact with the natural world, such as biology or environmental science. Thus, while it's possible he might be in computer science, it's not the highest probability given his personality sketch.
