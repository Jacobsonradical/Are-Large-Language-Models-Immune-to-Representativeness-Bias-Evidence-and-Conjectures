The subject's strong empathy, love for animals, and deep appreciation for nature align more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. While high intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts are important in computer science, the subject's empathetic and nature-oriented characteristics suggest that computer science may not be the most likely fit. However, it's still possible given the growing interdisciplinary nature of tech with fields like bioinformatics or environmental informatics.
