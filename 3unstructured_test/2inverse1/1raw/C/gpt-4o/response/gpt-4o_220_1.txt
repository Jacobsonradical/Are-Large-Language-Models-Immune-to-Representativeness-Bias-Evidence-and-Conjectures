This estimate takes into account Adam's strong intellectual abilities and proficiency with abstract concepts, traits that align well with the demands of computer science. However, his deep love for nature, animals, and plant life suggests he might be more inclined towards fields related to biology or environmental science. Thus, while there is a fair possibility that Adam might be in computer science, it's balanced with his pronounced interests in other areas.
