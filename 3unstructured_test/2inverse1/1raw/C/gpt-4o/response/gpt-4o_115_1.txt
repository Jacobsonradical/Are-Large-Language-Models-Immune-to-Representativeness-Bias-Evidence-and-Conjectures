  "computer science": 0.7
}

Given Adam's high intelligence, ability to solve puzzles, and good understanding of abstract concepts, it is plausible for him to be enrolled in computer science. His strong appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with the demands of this field. Although his deep love for nature, strong empathy, and interest in animals are not typical markers of a computer science student, they do not preclude his enrollment in the field. Thus, I estimate a probability of 0.7.
