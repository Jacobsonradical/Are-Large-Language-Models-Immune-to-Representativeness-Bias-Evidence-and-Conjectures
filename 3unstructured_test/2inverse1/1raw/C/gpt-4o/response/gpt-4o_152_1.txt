Given Adam's personality sketch, there are several factors influencing this estimate. While Adam demonstrates high intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts, which are beneficial for a field like computer science, the other aspects of his personality such as his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature might align him more closely with fields related to biology, environmental science, or veterinary studies. Hence, while it is not impossible for someone with his traits to be in computer science, the probability is moderately lower compared to other potentially more aligned fields.
