Given the personality sketch, it seems that Adam might be more inclined towards biological sciences, wildlife studies, or other nature-related fields due to his deep love for animals and curiosity about nature. However, his high intelligence, strong understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles do align somewhat with the skills typically found in computer science students. Therefore, while there's a possibility, it might be less likely compared to other fields more directly related to his stated interests.
