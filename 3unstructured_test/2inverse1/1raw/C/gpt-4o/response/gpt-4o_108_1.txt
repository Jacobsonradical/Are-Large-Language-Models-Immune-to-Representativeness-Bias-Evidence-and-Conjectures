Explanation: Given Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is very possible that he could be studying computer science. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals, along with his quiet and empathetic nature, might make him equally or more likely to pursue fields related to natural sciences, biology, or environmental studies. Thus, the probability is moderate but not definitive.
