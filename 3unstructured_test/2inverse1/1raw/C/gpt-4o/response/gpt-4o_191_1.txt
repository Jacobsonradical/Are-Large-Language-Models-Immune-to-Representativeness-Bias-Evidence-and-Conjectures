Given Adam's traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles, it is possible he could be drawn to the logical and abstract nature of computer science. However, his strong affinity for natural elements and empathy might suggest a greater likelihood for fields directly related to the environment or life sciences. Therefore, while it's plausible, it's not the most probable field based on his personality sketch.
