The probability isn't extremely high or low; while Adamâ€™s personality traits suggest he could excel in a variety of fields and his high intelligence and problem-solving skills are a good fit for computer science, his strong empathy and deep love for animals and nature might suggest a higher probability for fields more directly connected with these interests, such as biology or environmental science. Therefore, a moderate probability is assigned.
