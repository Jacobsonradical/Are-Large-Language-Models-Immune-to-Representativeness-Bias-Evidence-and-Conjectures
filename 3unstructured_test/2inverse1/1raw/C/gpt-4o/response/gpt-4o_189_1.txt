  "computer science": "0.5"
}

Adam's personality traits, such as a high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, align well with attributes often found in computer science students. However, the strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants are less typically associated with computer science students, who might be more focused on technology and programming. Given this mix of congruent and less typical traits, a probability of 0.5 seems a reasonable estimate.
