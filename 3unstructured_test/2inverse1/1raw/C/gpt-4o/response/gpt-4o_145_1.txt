Given Adam's high intelligence, strong understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, it is quite plausible that he could be enrolled in a field like computer science. His curiosity about nature and appreciation for hard work might lead him to appreciate the intricate and logical nature of computer science. However, specific details in the personality sketch such as a deep love for animals and strong empathy might more typically align with fields like biology or environmental science. Hence, the estimate is relatively high but not close to certainty.
