**Reasoning:**

While the description points towards someone analytical and intelligent, which are traits often found in computer science students, there's a strong emphasis on nature and empathy. This suggests interests potentially more aligned with biology, environmental science, or even veterinary studies. 

* **Lower probability (0.3):**  The puzzle-solving aspect and abstract thinking could certainly apply to computer science, but the core personality description leans away from it. 
* **Not impossible:** It's entirely possible for someone with these interests to study computer science, perhaps with a focus on bioinformatics or AI with applications in nature conservation. However, based on the provided sketch, it's less likely than some other fields.
