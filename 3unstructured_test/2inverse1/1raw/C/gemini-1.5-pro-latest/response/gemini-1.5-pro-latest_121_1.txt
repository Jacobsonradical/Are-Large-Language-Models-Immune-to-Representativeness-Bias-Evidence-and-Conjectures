**Reasoning:**

While the description points towards someone analytical and intelligent, which are traits often found in computer science students, it leans heavily on nature, empathy, and animal love. These aren't exclusive to other fields, but are less typical markers of a computer science student compared to, say, a biology or veterinary student.  

* **Lower probability (0.3):** The strong emphasis on nature and animals makes it somewhat less likely Adam is in computer science.
* **Not impossible:** The description does highlight intelligence and abstract thinking, which are certainly applicable to computer science.

**Therefore, 0.3 represents a balanced probability given the information.**
