  "computer science": "0.4"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the description highlights intelligence and an affinity for abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, there's no direct indication of an interest in technology, programming, or related fields. 

Here's why the probability is moderate but not high:

* **Positive Signals:**
    *  "Enjoys solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts" can be indicative of a mind drawn to computational thinking.
    * High intelligence is common among computer science students. 

* **Neutral Signals:**
    *  The description focuses heavily on nature, empathy, and animals, which don't strongly relate to computer science.

* **Lack of Signals:** 
    * There's no mention of computers, technology, building things, or other common interests of those drawn to computer science. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.4 reflects the possibility that Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills could lead him to computer science, but the lack of direct indicators makes it less likely than if the description included technology-related interests.**
