**Explanation:**

While the description highlights intelligence and an affinity for problem-solving, traits often associated with computer science students, it heavily emphasizes a connection to nature, empathy, and a love for animals.  These are not traits commonly associated with the computer science field. 

* **Lower Probability (0.3):**  The lack of direct links to technology or typical computer science interests lowers the probability. 
* **Not Impossible:** It's entirely possible for someone with these interests to study computer science. They might be interested in bioinformatics, computational biology, or other interdisciplinary fields.

**Therefore, 0.3 represents a low but not impossible probability.**
