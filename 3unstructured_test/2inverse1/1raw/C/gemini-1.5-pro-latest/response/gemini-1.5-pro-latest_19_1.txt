**Reasoning:**

While the description highlights intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts - all relevant to computer science -  it leans heavily into traits more commonly associated with fields like biology, ecology, or veterinary sciences.  

Here's why I chose 0.3 (relatively low probability):

* **Strong Nature Focus:** The emphasis on "curiosity about nature and plants" and "deep love for animals" points strongly away from computer science. 
* **Lack of Tech Indicators:** There's no mention of interest in technology, programming, or computers, which are strong indicators for the field.
* **"Warm Heart" and Empathy:** While present in many computer scientists, these traits are more often highlighted in professions focused on living beings or social interactions.

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective estimate. Many computer scientists share the described traits. Without more information about Adam's specific interests and activities, it's impossible to give a definitive probability.
