**Reasoning:**

While the description points towards someone analytical and intelligent, which are common traits in computer science students, it heavily leans towards an affinity for nature and animals. This suggests fields like biology, ecology, or veterinary science might be more likely. 

* **Intelligence and abstract thinking:**  Apply to computer science, but are also found in many other fields.
* **Puzzle solving:**  A plus for computer science, but also relevant to math, engineering, and even some humanities fields. 
* **Nature and animal love:** These are the strongest indicators and don't typically align with computer science stereotypes.

Therefore, the probability is slightly below average, hence 0.4.
