  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Explanation:**

While the description highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and abstract thinking – traits often associated with computer science students – it leans heavily on nature-related interests. 

A score of 0.3 suggests:

* **Moderate Chance:**  The profile somewhat aligns with a computer science student, but the nature focus introduces significant uncertainty. 
* **Not Unlikely, Not Highly Probable:**  It's plausible, but not a strong assumption that Adam is in computer science based on this description alone.
