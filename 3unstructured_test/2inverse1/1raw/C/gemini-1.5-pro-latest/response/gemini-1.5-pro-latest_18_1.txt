  "computer science": "0.3"

**Explanation:**

While the description highlights intelligence and an affinity for abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, it leans heavily towards interests in nature, animals, and empathy.  This suggests a higher likelihood of fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. A probability of 0.3 represents a moderate chance, acknowledging the possibility that Adam's intellectual curiosity could extend to computer science, but it's less likely given the other strong indicators.
