**Reasoning:**

While the description points to someone analytical ("enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," "understands abstract concepts"), these traits are not exclusive to computer science.  The strong affinity for nature and animals suggests a higher likelihood of fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. However, it's still possible Adam could be in a computer science program with a strong personal interest in nature. 

Here's a breakdown of the probability estimate:

* **30% Chance:** The analytical traits are consistent with computer science, but the strong nature theme pushes the probability lower than someone with a stronger technology or coding interest.
