**Reasoning:**

While the description points towards a curious and intelligent individual capable of abstract thought (traits often found in computer science students), there's a strong emphasis on nature, empathy, and understanding hard work. These traits could apply to various fields. 

Here's why I didn't rate the probability higher:

* **Lack of direct technical indicators:** The description lacks mentions of computers, technology, or programming, which would be stronger indicators of someone in computer science.
* **Nature emphasis:** The focus on nature and animals might suggest fields like biology, ecology, or veterinary science as equally likely. 

Therefore, a probability of 0.4 acknowledges the possibility while recognizing that the description doesn't strongly confirm Adam being a computer science student.
