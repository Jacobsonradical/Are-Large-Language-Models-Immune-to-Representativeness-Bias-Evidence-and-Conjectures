{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the description points towards someone analytical and intelligent, which are traits often found in computer science students, there's no direct correlation. Here's why I chose 0.4 (moderate probability):

* **Strong Points for Computer Science:**
    * "Enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are aligned with computational thinking. 
    * High intelligence is common in the field.

* **Neutral Points:**
    *  Quietness, warmth, empathy, and love for animals are not specific to any particular field. 

* **Weak Points for Computer Science:**
    * "Genuine curiosity about nature and plants" might suggest interests more aligned with biology or environmental sciences. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.4 reflects the possibility that Adam could be a computer science student, but it's not a strong indication.**
