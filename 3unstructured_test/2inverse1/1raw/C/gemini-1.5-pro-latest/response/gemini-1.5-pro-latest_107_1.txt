  "computer science": "0.3"

```

**Explanation:**

While the description mentions high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which are common traits in computer science students, it leans heavily towards interests and personality characteristics more typically associated with fields like biology, ecology, or veterinary science. 

Here's why the probability is relatively low:

* **Strong emphasis on nature and animals:**  The description highlights "genuine curiosity about nature," "deep love for animals," and interest in plants. These are less common as primary motivators for computer science students.
* **Quiet and empathetic:** While these traits can be found in any field, they are less stereotypically associated with computer science compared to the more analytical and problem-solving aspects highlighted.

**A probability of 0.3 reflects that it's possible Adam is in computer science, but the description makes it less likely than if it emphasized mathematical or technological interests.**
