{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While the description highlights intelligence and an affinity for abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, there's no direct link to the field.  Here's why I chose a probability of 0.3:

* **Positive Indicators:**  "High intelligence" and "understanding abstract concepts" are common traits among computer science students. 
* **Neutral Indicators:**  The personality description emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature. These traits are not particularly common nor uncommon in computer science students.
* **Lack of Strong Indicators:** There's no mention of programming, technology, problem-solving in a computational context, or other strong indicators of interest in computer science. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.3 represents a slightly higher than average chance, acknowledging the intellectual capacity mentioned, but not overly strong due to the lack of direct connections to the field.**
