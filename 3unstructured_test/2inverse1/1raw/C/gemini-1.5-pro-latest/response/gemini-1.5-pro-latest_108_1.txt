**Reasoning:**

While the description highlights intelligence and an affinity for problem-solving, which are common traits in computer science students, it heavily emphasizes nature, empathy, and animal love. These lean more towards fields like biology, ecology, or veterinary science. 

A computer science student *could* possess these traits, so the probability isn't extremely low. However, the description doesn't strongly suggest a computer science focus.
