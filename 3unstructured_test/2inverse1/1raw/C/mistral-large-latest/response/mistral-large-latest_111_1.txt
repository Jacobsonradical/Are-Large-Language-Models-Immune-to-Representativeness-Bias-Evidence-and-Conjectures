{
  "computer science": 0.65
}

Explanation: The subject's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills and interests common in computer science. However, the focus on nature, plants, and animals slightly reduces the probability, as these interests are more commonly associated with fields like biology or environmental science. Thus, a probability of 0.65 is a reasonable estimate.
