Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with someone studying computer science. However, the strong empathy, love of animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication are less directly related to computer science. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that the personality sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student.
