Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and Adam's enrollment as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, aptitude for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts seem compatible with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals is less directly relevant. Given the mix of applicable and less applicable characteristics, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that the personality sketch describes a computer science graduate student.
