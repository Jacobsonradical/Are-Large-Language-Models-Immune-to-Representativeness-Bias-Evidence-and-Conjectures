Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits could fit well with a computer science student. However, the sketch also emphasizes curiosity about nature, plants, animals and a warm and empathetic personality. While these qualities don't preclude someone from studying computer science, they are not stereotypically associated with the field. Therefore, while it's certainly possible the sketch is describing Adam as a computer science grad student, I don't think it's a slam dunk based on the information provided. My rough estimate is that there is a 60% chance the sketch is about Adam the computer science student.
