Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving ability, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts could fit well with a computer science student. However, the strong empathy, love of nature and animals are less stereotypically associated with that field. So while computer science seems like a reasonable possibility given the traits described, I don't have extremely high confidence that it's a match based solely on this brief sketch. My rough estimate is that there's a 60% chance Adam was studying computer science.
