Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at understanding abstract concepts, and has strong empathy. While some of these traits could apply to a computer science student, the curiosity seems more focused on nature and plants rather than technology. The empathy and love of animals also seem less characteristic of a typical computer science student, though of course there is individual variation. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying computer science, I don't think this personality profile provides strong evidence of that. My rough estimate is that there is a 30% chance the sketch is describing a computer science graduate student.
