Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, intelligent, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to graduate students across many fields, they seem reasonably well-aligned with computer science. The curiosity, problem-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstractions are common among computer science students and practitioners. The sketch doesn't mention specific computer science interests, so I wouldn't assign a very high probability, but I believe there is a moderate likelihood, around 60%, that it could describe a computer science grad student like Adam based on the details provided.
