Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is highly intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits are often associated with people in technical and quantitative fields like computer science. The curiosity about nature and love of animals are less directly related to computer science, but not incompatible with it. Overall, based on the limited information provided, I estimate a 60% probability that this sketch describes a computer science graduate student like Adam. However, there are certainly graduate students in other fields who could also fit this personality profile.
