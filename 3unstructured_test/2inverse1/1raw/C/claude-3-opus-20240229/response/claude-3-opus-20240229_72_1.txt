Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch mentions qualities like curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving, which are common among computer science students. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals is less typical for that field, so I don't think the probability is extremely high that this sketch refers to a computer science graduate student. A probability around 0.6 seems reasonable to me given the mix of traits described.
