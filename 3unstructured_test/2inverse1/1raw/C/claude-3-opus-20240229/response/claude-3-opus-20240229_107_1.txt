Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, which aligns well with skills valuable for computer science. However, the strong focus on curiosity about nature, plants, and love of animals seems less common for computer science students compared to some other fields. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying computer science, I don't think it's an extremely high probability fit based solely on the given personality sketch. Therefore, I estimate the probability at 0.6.
