Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the fact that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, which aligns well with computer science. The curiosity about nature and love of animals is less directly relevant to CS, but could still fit. Overall, based just on this limited information, I estimate a 60% chance that the sketch describes a computer science graduate student like Adam.
