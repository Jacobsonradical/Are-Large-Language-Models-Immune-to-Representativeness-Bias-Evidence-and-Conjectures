Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking, and highly intelligent. While this could describe graduate students in a variety of fields, the combination of traits seems more likely for someone in a STEM field like computer science compared to many other grad school disciplines. The interest in nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts fits the profile of many computer science students. However, the empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are less stereotypically associated with CS, so I did not assign a higher probability than 0.6. Of course, individuals in any field can have a wide range of interests and personality traits.
