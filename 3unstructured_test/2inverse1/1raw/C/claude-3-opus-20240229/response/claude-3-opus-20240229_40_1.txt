Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits are common among computer science students. The curiosity about nature and love of animals are less directly related to computer science. Given the mix of traits, some of which correlate with computer science and some of which do not, I estimate a 60% probability that the personality sketch describes a computer science graduate student named Adam in the U.S. in 2021.
