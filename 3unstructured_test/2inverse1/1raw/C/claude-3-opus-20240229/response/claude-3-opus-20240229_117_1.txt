Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving. These traits could align well with someone pursuing graduate studies in computer science. However, the strong interest in plants, animals and nature is less typical for a computer science student, so I didn't assign a higher probability than 0.6. The sketch is certainly compatible with a CS student but not a perfect match based on stereotypical traits. Let me know if you would like me to explain my reasoning further!
