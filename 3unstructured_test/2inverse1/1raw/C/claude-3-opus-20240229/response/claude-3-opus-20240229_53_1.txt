Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the assumption that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong empathy, love for nature/animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication are less clearly associated with computer science compared to some other fields. So while computer science seems like a reasonable possibility given the profile, I don't have extremely high confidence in that specific field based solely on the personality description provided.
