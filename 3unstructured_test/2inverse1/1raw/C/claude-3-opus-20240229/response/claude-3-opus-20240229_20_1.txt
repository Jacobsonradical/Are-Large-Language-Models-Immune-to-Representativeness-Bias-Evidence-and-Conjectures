Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts seem reasonably well-aligned with studying computer science. However, the strong empathy, love of animals and nature are less stereotypical traits for that field, so I didn't assign a higher probability than 0.6.
