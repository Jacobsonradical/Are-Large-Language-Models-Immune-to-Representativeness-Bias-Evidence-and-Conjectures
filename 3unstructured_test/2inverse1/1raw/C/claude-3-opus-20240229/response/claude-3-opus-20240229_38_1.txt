Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic and loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more strongly associated with other fields such as biology, veterinary medicine, or psychology. Computer science tends to attract those more interested in technology, programming, and problem-solving. So while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I estimate a relatively low 30% probability based solely on the given personality description. More information would be needed to make a confident assessment.
