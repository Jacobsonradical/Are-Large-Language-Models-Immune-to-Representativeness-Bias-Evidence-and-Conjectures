Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who loves nature, animals, and abstract concepts. While some computer science students certainly fit that description, the sketch doesn't mention typical computer science traits like a passion for technology, programming, or mathematics. So while it's possible the sketch is describing Adam as a computer science grad student, I don't think it's highly probable based on the information provided. My rough estimate is a 20% chance.
