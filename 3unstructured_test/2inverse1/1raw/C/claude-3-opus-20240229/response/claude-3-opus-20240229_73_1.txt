Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if Adam was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, which aligns well with skills needed for computer science. The curiosity and dedication also fit. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less directly relevant to computer science, so I estimate the probability is around 60% that this describes a computer science graduate student.
