Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, is empathetic, loves animals, is highly intelligent, appreciates hard work and dedication, and can understand abstract concepts well. While these traits could apply to people in many different fields, they seem reasonably well-aligned with someone who might pursue graduate studies in computer science. The logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstractions are especially relevant. However, the strong interest in nature and animals is less directly connected to computer science. Considering all the traits together, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch could be describing Adam as a computer science graduate student.
