Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving, which tend to be common among computer science students. However, the strong interests in nature, animals, and empathy are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Given the mix of traits, some more and some less aligned with the field, I estimate a moderate probability around 0.6 that this sketch would describe a computer science grad student. But there is considerable uncertainty in making such a judgment from limited information.
