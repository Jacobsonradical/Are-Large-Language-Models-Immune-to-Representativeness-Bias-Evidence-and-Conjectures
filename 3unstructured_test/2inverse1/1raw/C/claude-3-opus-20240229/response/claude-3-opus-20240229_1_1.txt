Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking, and has a strong work ethic. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem reasonably well-aligned with computer science. The curiosity, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills in particular seem relevant. However, the sketch also emphasizes empathy, a love of animals, and an interest in plants which seem less directly connected to computer science. Therefore, I estimate a 60% chance the sketch is describing a computer science graduate student, based on the limited information provided.
