Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving ability, intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts align fairly well with the typical profile of a computer science graduate student. However, the strong empathy, love of animals and nature are less common among computer science students, so I would estimate the probability is around 0.6 or 60% that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science grad student.
