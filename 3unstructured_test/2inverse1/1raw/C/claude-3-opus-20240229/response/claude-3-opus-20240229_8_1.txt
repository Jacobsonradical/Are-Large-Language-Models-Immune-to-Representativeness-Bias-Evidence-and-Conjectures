Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the specified field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, particularly curiosity, problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, could fit well with someone studying computer science. However, the strong empathy, love of nature and animals may be less common among computer science students compared to some other fields. So while the sketch is compatible with a computer science student, it's not definitive. My rough estimate is that there's a 60% chance the sketch is describing Adam as a computer science grad student.
