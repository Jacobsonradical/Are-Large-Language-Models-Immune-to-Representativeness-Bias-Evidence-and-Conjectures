Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and is good at abstract thinking and puzzles. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more indicative of a student in the life sciences or a field involving nature and animals. Computer science tends to attract those more interested in technology, coding, and building systems. So while it's possible Adam was a computer science grad student, I don't think the personality sketch provides strong evidence of that. My rough probability estimate is 0.4.
