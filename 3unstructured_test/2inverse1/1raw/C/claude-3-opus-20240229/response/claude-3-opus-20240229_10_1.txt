Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, is empathetic, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem reasonably well-aligned with someone who studies computer science. The interest in solving puzzles and facility with abstract concepts in particular seem like characteristics that would lend themselves well to graduate-level computer science work. However, the strong interest in nature and animals is less typical for this field, so I estimate the probability is only moderately high at 0.6, rather than a higher value.
