Here is my estimate, based on the personality sketch provided and the assumption that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature and plants, and the deep love for animals, while not incompatible with computer science, are not as directly related. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that the personality sketch is describing a computer science graduate student.
