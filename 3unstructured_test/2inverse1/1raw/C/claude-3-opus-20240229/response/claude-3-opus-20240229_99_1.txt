Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, which aligns well with a computer science student. The curiosity about nature and love of animals is less directly relevant to computer science, but not incompatible. Overall, based on the limited information provided, I estimate a 60% probability that this sketch could describe a computer science graduate student like Adam.
