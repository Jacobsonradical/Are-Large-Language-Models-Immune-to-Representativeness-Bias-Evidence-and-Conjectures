Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could certainly apply to some computer science students, they don't seem especially correlated with that field compared to others. The curiosity about plants and love of animals in particular makes me think this person may be more likely to study something like biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, etc. So while it's certainly possible Adam studies computer science, I don't think the probability is higher than around 40% based on the given personality sketch.
