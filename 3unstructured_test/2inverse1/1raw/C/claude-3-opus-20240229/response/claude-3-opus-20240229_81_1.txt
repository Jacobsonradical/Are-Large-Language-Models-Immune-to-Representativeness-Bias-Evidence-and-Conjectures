Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, intelligent, empathetic, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to graduate students across many fields, they seem to align reasonably well with someone studying computer science. Computer science requires strong abstract thinking, problem solving skills, and intelligence. At the same time, the focus on nature, animals, and empathy is less directly relevant to computer science.

So while the personality sketch is compatible with a computer science student, it's not a perfect match, hence my probability estimate of 0.6. There is a decent chance the sketch is referring to the computer science student Adam, but a fair amount of uncertainty remains. The traits and interests span a range wider than the typical computer science profile.
