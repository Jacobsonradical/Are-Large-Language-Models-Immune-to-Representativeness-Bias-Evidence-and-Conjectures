Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits seem compatible with studying computer science at the graduate level. The curiosity about nature and love of animals are less directly related to computer science, but plenty of computer science students have diverse interests outside of their field of study. Overall, the personality sketch seems reasonably consistent with a graduate student in computer science, so I estimate a 60% probability that it describes Adam. However, there are certainly other fields of study that could also fit this personality profile.
