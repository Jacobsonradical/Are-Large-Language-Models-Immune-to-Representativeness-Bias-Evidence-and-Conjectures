Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts could fit well with a computer science student. However, the strong empathy, love of nature and animals are less stereotypically associated with that field. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying computer science, I don't have extremely high confidence in that match based solely on the personality description provided.
