Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving, intelligent, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they align reasonably well with someone in computer science. The curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts and problem-solving are common among those attracted to the field. However, the strong interest in nature and love of animals are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Overall, I'd estimate a 60% chance the sketch is referring to Adam as a computer science grad student, but there is considerable uncertainty. The sketch could potentially match students in various other STEM fields, social sciences, or humanities as well.
