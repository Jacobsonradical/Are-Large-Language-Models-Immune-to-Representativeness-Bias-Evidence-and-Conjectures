Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits are common among people who study computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and a warm and empathetic personality. While these traits certainly can be found in computer science students, they are not as stereotypically associated with that field. Therefore, while it's reasonably likely the sketch could describe a computer science student, I don't think it's a near certainty. My rough estimate is that there is a 60% chance the sketch is about Adam if he was a computer science graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.
