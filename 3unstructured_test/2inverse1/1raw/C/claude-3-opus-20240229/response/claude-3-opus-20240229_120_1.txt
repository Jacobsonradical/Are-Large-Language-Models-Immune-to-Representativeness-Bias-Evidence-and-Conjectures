Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is very interested in nature, plants, and animals, has strong empathy, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While some of these traits could apply to a computer science student, the overall profile seems more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine that involve directly studying nature and animals. The abstract thinking and intelligence mentioned are certainly applicable to computer science, but the other details make me think it's less than a 50% chance that the sketch is describing a computer science graduate student specifically. Of course, there is significant uncertainty in estimating this probability from the limited information provided.
