Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has high intelligence, and can understand abstract concepts well. These traits could align with a computer science student. However, the sketch also emphasizes empathy, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work, which are not necessarily core traits associated with computer science. Given the mix of traits, some of which fit well with computer science and some of which seem less directly relevant, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that the sketch is describing Adam as a computer science graduate student.
