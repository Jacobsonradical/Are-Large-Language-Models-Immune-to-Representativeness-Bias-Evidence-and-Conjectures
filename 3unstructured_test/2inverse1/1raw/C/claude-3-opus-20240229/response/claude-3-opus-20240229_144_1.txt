Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature and plants, loves animals, is empathetic, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they seem more likely for a field like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine than for computer science. Good computer scientists can certainly have those characteristics, but they are not as strongly associated with the field as technical and mathematical prowess. So I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch describes a computer science graduate student.
