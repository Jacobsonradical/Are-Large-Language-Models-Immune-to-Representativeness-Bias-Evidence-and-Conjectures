Here is my estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious, intelligent, empathetic, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to graduate students in many fields, they align reasonably well with someone studying computer science. Computer science requires strong abstract thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and dedication. However, the mention of curiosity about nature and love of animals makes me somewhat less confident that the sketch is specifically describing a computer science student as opposed to a student in other STEM fields or even non-STEM disciplines. Therefore, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student in 2021.
