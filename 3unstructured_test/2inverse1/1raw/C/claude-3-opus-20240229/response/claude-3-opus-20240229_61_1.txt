Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic and loves animals, is highly intelligent, and has an appreciation for hard work. While some of these traits could apply to a computer science graduate student, the strong emphasis on curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals suggests fields more directly related to the natural world. A probability of 0.4 reflects that while it's certainly possible Adam was studying computer science, the sketch points more towards fields like biology, environmental science, ecology, zoology, etc. Computer science is a heavily abstract and technical field that doesn't directly relate to the personality traits highlighted. But problem solving skills and high intelligence are certainly relevant. So I've estimated a moderate probability but not an exceptionally high one based on the information provided.
