Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information about Adam being a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could align well with a computer science student. Problem solving skills are also important in that field. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less directly related to typical computer science pursuits. So while it's certainly possible Adam was a computer science grad student, I don't think it's a slam dunk based solely on the personality sketch, hence my estimated probability of 0.6.
