Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, which aligns well with typical traits of computer science students. The curiosity about nature and love of animals is less directly relevant to computer science. Overall, the description seems reasonably probable for a computer science grad student, but not a slam dunk, so I estimate the probability at 0.6.
