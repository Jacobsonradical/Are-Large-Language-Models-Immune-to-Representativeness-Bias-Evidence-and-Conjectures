Here is my estimate, based on the personality sketch and the information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at solving puzzles, intelligent, and able to understand abstract concepts. While these qualities could apply to some computer science students, the strong emphasis on curiosity about plants, love of animals, and empathy are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, I estimate there is only a moderate probability, around 0.3, that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student. The sketch seems more likely to fit a student in a field like biology, zoology, or veterinary medicine. However, there is still some possibility it could describe a computer science student.
