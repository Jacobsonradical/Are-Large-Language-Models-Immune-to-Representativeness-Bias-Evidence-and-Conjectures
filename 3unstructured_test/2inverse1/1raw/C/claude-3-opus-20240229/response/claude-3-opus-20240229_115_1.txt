Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and information about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys problem-solving. These traits would align well with studying computer science. The curiosity about nature and love of animals are less directly relevant but not incompatible with computer science. Without more specific information indicating their field of study, computer science seems like a reasonable probability but not a certainty, so I've estimated the probability as 0.6.
