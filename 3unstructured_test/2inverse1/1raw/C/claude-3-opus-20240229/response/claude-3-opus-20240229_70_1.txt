Here is my estimate, based on the limited information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch does not strongly indicate computer science in particular. While computer science requires intelligence and abstract thinking, which the subject possesses, it does not necessarily involve curiosity about nature, plants, animals or a warm/empathetic personality. Many other fields of graduate study could also fit the described traits. Without more specific information pointing to computer science, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that this student was in that particular field.
