Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and an understanding of abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more typical of someone in a field related to the natural sciences, such as biology, ecology, or zoology. The sketch does not mention any specific traits that are strongly associated with computer science, such as a passion for programming, algorithms, or technology. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.4 that the sketch is about Adam if he was a computer science graduate student.
