Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with curiosity, intelligence, empathy, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to graduate students across many fields, they seem to align reasonably well with someone studying computer science. The interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts in particular seems characteristic of many computer science students and professionals. However, the strong interest in nature, plants and animals is less stereotypically associated with computer science (though certainly many computer scientists have broad interests including in the natural world). Therefore, while computer science seems like a plausible field of study for the person described, I would not assign an extremely high probability without additional information. A probability of 0.6 reflects that computer science is a reasonable guess but there is still significant uncertainty.
