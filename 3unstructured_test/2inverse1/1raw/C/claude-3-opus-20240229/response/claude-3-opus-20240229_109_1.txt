Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the assumption that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with someone studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less directly relevant to computer science. So while this personality could potentially be a computer science student, it's not a certainty based on the given information. Hence, I estimate a 60% probability that the personality sketch describes a computer science graduate student.
