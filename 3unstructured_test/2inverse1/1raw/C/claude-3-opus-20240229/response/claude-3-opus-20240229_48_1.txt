Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the fact that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts, which could fit well with studying computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature, plants, animals, and empathy makes me think fields like biology, zoology, ecology, or veterinary medicine could also be possibilities. So while computer science seems plausible, I don't think it's a certainty based solely on the given information. Therefore, I estimated the probability at 0.6.
