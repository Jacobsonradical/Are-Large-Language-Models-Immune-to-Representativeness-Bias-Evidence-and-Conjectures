Here is my estimate, based on the personality sketch and the information provided about Adam:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, which aligns well with typical traits of computer science students. The curiosity about nature and love of animals is less directly relevant but not incompatible. Without more specific information linking the sketch to computer science, I'd estimate a 60% chance the sketch is describing Adam as a computer science grad student, based on the available information.
