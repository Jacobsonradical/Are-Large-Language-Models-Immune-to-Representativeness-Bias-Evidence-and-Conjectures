Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

While some aspects of the personality sketch could fit a computer science student, such as high intelligence and being good at understanding abstract concepts, other key traits mentioned seem less likely for that field, such as the strong curiosity about nature and plants, the deep love for animals, and the quietness. The sketch overall seems to describe someone more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or veterinary science than computer science. So I estimate a relatively low 30% probability that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student.
