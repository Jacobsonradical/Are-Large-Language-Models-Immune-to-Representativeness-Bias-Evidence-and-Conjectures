Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at understanding abstract concepts, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, there is a reasonable chance they describe a computer science student. Computer science requires strong abstract and analytical thinking abilities. At the same time, the sketch portrays someone with a love of nature, animals and puzzles, which is not as stereotypically associated with computer science.

Based on the limited information provided, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch is describing Adam as a computer science grad student. More details about his specific interests and background would help refine the estimate. But the intelligence and abstract thinking fit decently well, even if the curiosity about nature is less typical for the field.
