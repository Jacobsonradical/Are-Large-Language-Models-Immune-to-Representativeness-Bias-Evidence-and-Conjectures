Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

While the personality sketch indicates high intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts, which could fit with computer science, the other traits mentioned such as curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love of animals seem less directly related to typical computer science interests. So I estimate a 30% probability that this personality sketch describes a computer science graduate student, based on the limited information provided.
