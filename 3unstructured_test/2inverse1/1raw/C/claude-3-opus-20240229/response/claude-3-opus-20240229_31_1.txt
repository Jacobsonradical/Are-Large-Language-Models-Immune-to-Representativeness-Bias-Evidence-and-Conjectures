Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits could fit well with a computer science student. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less directly relevant to computer science. Therefore, while it seems reasonably likely the sketch could be of a computer science student, I don't think it's a slam dunk, so I estimate the probability at 0.6.
