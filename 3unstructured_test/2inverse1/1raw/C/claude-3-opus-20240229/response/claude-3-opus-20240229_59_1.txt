Here is my estimate in the requested format:

  "computer science": "0.2"

The personality sketch describes someone who loves nature, animals, and abstract thinking, and has strong empathy. While it's certainly possible for a computer science student to have those traits, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, veterinary medicine, psychology, or philosophy. Computer science tends to attract people who enjoy working with technology, programming, and algorithms. So while it's plausible Adam studies computer science, I think it's more likely his graduate studies are in a different field given the details in the personality sketch.
