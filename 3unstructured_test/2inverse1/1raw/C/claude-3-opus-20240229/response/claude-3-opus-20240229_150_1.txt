Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more directly applicable to fields like biology, veterinary medicine, or psychology. Computer science tends to attract those with strong math, logic and problem-solving skills. So while it's certainly possible Adam studies computer science, I estimate a lower probability of around 0.3 based solely on the personality description provided.
