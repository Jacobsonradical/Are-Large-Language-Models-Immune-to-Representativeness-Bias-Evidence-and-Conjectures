Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic and loves animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While someone with these traits could certainly study computer science, the sketch doesn't mention specific interests or skills that are strongly associated with computer science, such as mathematics, programming, or technology. Therefore, based on the limited information provided, I estimate there is only a moderate probability of around 0.3 that this sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student.
