Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and puzzle-solving seem compatible with someone studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less stereotypically associated with computer science, so I would put the probability around 0.6 that this sketch describes a computer science grad student. Of course, there is a lot of individual variation and these are generalizations.
