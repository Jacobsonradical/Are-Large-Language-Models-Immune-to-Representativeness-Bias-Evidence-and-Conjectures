Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The interests and traits described - curiosity about nature, enjoys puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts - seem compatible with someone who might study computer science. The empathy, warm heart, and love of animals are less directly related but certainly compatible. So while not definitive, I believe there is a reasonable likelihood, more probable than not, that a graduate student with this personality sketch could be studying computer science.
