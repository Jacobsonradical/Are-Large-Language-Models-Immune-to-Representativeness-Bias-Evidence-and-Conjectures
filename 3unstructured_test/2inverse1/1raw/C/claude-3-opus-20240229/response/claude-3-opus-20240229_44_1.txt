Here is my estimate, based on the personality sketch and the information about Adam being a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts could fit well with a computer science student. However, the strong emphasis on nature, plants, animals, and empathy makes me think there is a reasonable chance Adam may have studied something else, perhaps biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. Therefore, I estimate the probability of Adam being a computer science graduate student based on the personality sketch to be around 0.6.
