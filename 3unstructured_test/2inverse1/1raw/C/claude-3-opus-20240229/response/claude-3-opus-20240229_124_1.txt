Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a computer science graduate student in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who loves nature, plants and animals, is empathetic, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they don't seem especially characteristic of computer science students compared to other disciplines. The abstract thinking and puzzle-solving aspects fit somewhat with computer science. Overall, without more context, I'd estimate only a modest 30% probability that this sketch describes a typical computer science grad student. But there's a lot of individual variation of course.
