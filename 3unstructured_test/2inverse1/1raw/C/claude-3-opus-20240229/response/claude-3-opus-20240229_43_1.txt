Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like curiosity, problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, which are common among people in computer science. However, the strong interest in nature and animals is less typical for this field. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that the sketch describes a computer science graduate student.
