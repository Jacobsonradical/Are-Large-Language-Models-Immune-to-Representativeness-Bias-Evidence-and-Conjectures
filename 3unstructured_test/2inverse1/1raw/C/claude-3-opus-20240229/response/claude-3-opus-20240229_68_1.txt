Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and is good at abstract thinking. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they seem more strongly associated with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or environmental science. The sketch doesn't mention typical computer science traits like strong math skills, interest in programming and technology, or a systemizing mindset. So while it's certainly possible Adam studies computer science, I don't think it's a highly probable match based solely on the given personality profile. My rough estimate is a 30% probability.
