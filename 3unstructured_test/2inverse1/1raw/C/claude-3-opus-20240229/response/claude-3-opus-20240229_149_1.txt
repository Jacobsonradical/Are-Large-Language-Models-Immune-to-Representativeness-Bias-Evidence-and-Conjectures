Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and a love for animals, which are not stereotypically associated with computer science. However, it also mentions an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, as well as high intelligence, which are traits that could be associated with computer science.

Given the mix of traits, some of which seem less aligned with computer science and others which seem more aligned, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that the sketch is describing Adam as a computer science graduate student. But there is considerable uncertainty in this estimate given the limited information provided.
