Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at understanding abstract concepts, and highly intelligent. While these traits could apply to many fields, they align reasonably well with someone studying computer science. Computer science involves abstract problem solving and requires strong analytical intelligence.

However, the sketch also emphasizes empathy, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work, which are less directly related to stereotypical traits of computer science students. Therefore, while I think there is a reasonable probability the sketch is of a computer science student, I wouldn't rate the likelihood as extremely high. Of course, there is a lot of individual variation and many computer science students could certainly fit this overall profile.
