Here is my estimate of the probability that the given personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is highly intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits are common among people who study computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes the person's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, which are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, while there is a reasonable probability that Adam was studying computer science based on the personality sketch, I would estimate it at 0.6 rather than a higher value. Of course, this is a rough estimate and many additional factors could influence the actual probability.
