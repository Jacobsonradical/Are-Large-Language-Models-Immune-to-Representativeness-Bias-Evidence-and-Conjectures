Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the fact that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with a computer science student. However, the strong interest in nature and animals makes me a bit less confident in that match. Since the field has to be estimated based on limited information, I assign a probability of 0.6 that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science grad student.
