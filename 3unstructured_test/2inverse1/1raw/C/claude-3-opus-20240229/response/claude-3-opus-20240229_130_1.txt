Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving ability, high intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts could fit well with a computer science student. However, the strong empathy, love of nature and animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are less stereotypically associated with computer science, so I did not assign a probability higher than 0.6. Of course, any individual can have a diverse set of interests and traits.
