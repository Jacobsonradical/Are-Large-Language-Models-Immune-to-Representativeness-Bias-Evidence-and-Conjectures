Here is my estimate, based on the provided personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, enjoying puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong empathy, love of nature and animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are less directly associated with computer science. Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam studied computer science, I don't think it's a near certainty based solely on the personality sketch, so I estimate a 60% probability.
