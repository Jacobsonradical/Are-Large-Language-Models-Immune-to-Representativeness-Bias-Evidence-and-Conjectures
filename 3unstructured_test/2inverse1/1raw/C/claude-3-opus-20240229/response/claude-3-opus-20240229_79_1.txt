Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits could align well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals is less typical for computer science, so I don't think the probability is extremely high that the sketch is referring to Adam if he was a computer science graduate student. A probability around 0.6 (60%) seems like a reasonable estimate to me based on the given information.
