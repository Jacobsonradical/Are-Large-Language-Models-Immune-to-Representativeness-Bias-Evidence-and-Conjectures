Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits align well with a computer science student. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals is less typical for this field. Therefore, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch is describing Adam as a computer science grad student.
