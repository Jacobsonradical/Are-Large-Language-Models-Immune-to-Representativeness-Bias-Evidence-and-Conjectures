Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits align well with a computer science student. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less stereotypically associated with computer science, so I assign a moderate probability of 0.6 rather than a higher value. Of course, there is individual variation and these interests are not incompatible with studying computer science.
