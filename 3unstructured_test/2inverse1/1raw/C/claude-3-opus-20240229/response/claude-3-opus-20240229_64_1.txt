Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, empathetic, and able to understand abstract concepts. While this could describe graduate students in many fields, I believe there is a somewhat higher than average probability that it describes a computer science student, since computer science requires strong abstract thinking abilities, intelligence, and problem solving skills. However, the curiosity about nature and plants, as well as the deep love for animals, are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Therefore, I estimate the probability of this describing a computer science graduate student as 0.6.
