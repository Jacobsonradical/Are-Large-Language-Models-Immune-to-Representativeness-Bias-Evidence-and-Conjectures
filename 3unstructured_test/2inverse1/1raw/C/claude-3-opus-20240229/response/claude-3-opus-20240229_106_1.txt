Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could fit well with a computer science field. However, the strong interests in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less directly related to typical computer science work, so I wouldn't assign a very high probability, but 0.6 seems a reasonable estimate that this personality could be a computer science graduate student.
