Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, which aligns well with a computer science student. The curiosity about nature and love of animals seems less directly related to computer science. So while the personality is plausibly a computer science student, I don't have extremely high confidence in that match based on the limited information provided. Therefore, I estimate the probability at 0.6, meaning I think there's a 60% chance the sketch is describing Adam as a computer science grad student.
