Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The subject's strong intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are traits that could align well with studying computer science. However, the personality sketch also emphasizes curiosity about nature, plants, animals and a warm heart, which are less directly related to computer science. Given the mix of traits, some of which seem more and some less aligned with computer science, I estimate a 60% probability that the personality sketch describes a computer science graduate student.
