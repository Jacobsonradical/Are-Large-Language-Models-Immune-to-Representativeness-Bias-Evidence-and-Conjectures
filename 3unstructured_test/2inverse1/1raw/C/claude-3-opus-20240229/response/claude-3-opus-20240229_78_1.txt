Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving aptitude, and ability to understand abstract concepts, which seem compatible with studying computer science. However, the strong emphasis on empathy, love of nature and animals doesn't seem as directly relevant for that field. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that it describes a computer science graduate student.
