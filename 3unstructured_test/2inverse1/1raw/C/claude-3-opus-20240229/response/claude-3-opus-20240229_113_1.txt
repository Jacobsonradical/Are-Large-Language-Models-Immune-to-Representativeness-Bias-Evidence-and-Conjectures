Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

  "computer science": "0.4"

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature and plants, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic and loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could align with many different fields of graduate study, they don't seem to specifically point to computer science as the most likely major. The curiosity about nature and love of animals may suggest a field like biology, zoology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. The puzzle-solving and abstract thinking abilities could align with fields like mathematics, physics, or philosophy. Computer science is certainly a possibility for an intelligent, abstract thinker, but the bio and nature elements of the description make me think it's less likely than some other fields, so I'd estimate around a 40% chance based on the limited information provided. More details about the specific research interests and skills of the individual would help narrow it down further.
