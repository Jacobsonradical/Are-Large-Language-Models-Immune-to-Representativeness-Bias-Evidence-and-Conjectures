Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is intelligent and good with abstract concepts. These traits could fit well with someone studying computer science. The empathy, love of animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication are also compatible with but perhaps less strongly predictive of a computer science focus. Overall, I'd estimate a 60% chance the sketch is describing a computer science graduate student, based on the limited information provided.
