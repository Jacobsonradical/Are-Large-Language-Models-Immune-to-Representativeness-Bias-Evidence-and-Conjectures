Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to many fields, the puzzle-solving aspect and strong grasp of abstract concepts suggests a reasonable probability of being a computer science student. However, the strong interest in nature, plants and animals is less typical for computer science, so I estimate the probability is only around 40% that this sketch describes a computer science graduate student.
