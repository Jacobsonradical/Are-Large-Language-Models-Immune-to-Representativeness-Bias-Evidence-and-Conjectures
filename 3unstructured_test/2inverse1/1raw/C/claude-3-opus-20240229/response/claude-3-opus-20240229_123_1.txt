Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, which aligns well with typical traits of computer science students. The curiosity about nature and love of animals is less directly relevant but not incompatible. Without more information it's impossible to say definitively, but based on the limited information provided, I estimate a 60% probability that the personality sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student in 2021.
