Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to graduate students in many fields, they seem to align reasonably well with computer science. An interest in puzzles, strong abstract thinking skills, and high intelligence are common among those who pursue graduate studies in computer science.

However, the strong interest in nature and love of animals are less stereotypically associated with computer science (compared to fields like biology or zoology for example). So while there are definitely aspects of the personality sketch that fit well with computer science, other details make it less than a perfect match in my estimation. Hence my rough probability estimate of 0.6.
