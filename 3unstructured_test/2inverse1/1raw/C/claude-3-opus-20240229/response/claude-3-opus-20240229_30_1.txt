Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, which could fit well with studying computer science. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals and empathy are less stereotypically associated with computer science. So while I think there is a reasonable probability Adam studied computer science given the traits described, I wouldn't say it's extremely high. Hence my rough estimate of 60% probability.
