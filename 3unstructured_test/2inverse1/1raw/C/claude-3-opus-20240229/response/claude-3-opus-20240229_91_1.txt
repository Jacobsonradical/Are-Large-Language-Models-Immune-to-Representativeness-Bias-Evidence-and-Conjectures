Here is my estimate, based on the personality sketch and the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with interests in nature, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts. While some computer science students certainly have those interests, they are not stereotypically associated with that field of study. The sketch does not mention specific interests more commonly associated with computer science, such as programming, algorithms, or technology. Therefore, while it's certainly possible Adam was studying computer science, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 based solely on the personality description provided.
