Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with someone studying computer science. However, the strong empathy, love of animals and nature are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.6 that the sketch describes a computer science grad student named Adam.
