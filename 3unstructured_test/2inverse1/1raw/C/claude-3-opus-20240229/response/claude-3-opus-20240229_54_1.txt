Here is my estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

While some aspects of the personality sketch could fit a computer science student, such as high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, other aspects seem less likely, such as the strong emphasis on curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love of animals. So I estimate a moderate probability of 0.4 that this personality sketch describes a computer science graduate student.
