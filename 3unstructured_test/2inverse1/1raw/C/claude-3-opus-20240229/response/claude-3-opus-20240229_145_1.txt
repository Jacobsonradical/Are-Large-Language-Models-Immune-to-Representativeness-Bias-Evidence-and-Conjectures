Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and background information:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking ability, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well with someone in computer science. However, the strong empathy, love of nature and animals, and quiet demeanor are less stereotypically associated with that field. So while it's certainly possible Adam studies computer science, I don't think the personality sketch provides especially strong evidence of that. My rough probability estimate is 0.4, but there is significant uncertainty around that number given the limited information provided.
