Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is highly intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits align well with the field of computer science. The curiosity about nature and love for animals are less directly relevant to computer science, but do not rule it out. Overall, based on the limited information provided, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.
