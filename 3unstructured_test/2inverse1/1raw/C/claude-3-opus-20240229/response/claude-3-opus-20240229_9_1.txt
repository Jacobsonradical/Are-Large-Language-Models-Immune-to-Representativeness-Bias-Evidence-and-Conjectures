Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature and plants, has empathy and loves animals, and appreciates hard work. While some computer science students certainly have those traits, they seem less stereotypically associated with computer science compared to some other fields. The abstract thinking and intelligence aspects fit well with computer science. But overall, without more information, I'd estimate only a modest 30% chance that the sketch is describing a computer science graduate student as opposed to a student in another field. The nature, animal and empathy aspects in particular make me think it could be describing a student in fields like biology, veterinary medicine, environmental science, etc. But this is just my best estimate based on the limited information provided.
