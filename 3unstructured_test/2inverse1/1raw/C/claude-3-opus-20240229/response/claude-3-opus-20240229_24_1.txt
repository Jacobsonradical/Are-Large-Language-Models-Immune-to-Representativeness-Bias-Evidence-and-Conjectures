Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, a good abstract thinker, and enjoys solving puzzles, which are traits that could fit well with studying computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes a love of nature, plants, animals and a strong sense of empathy, which are less directly related to computer science. Given the mix of traits, some of which align well with computer science and some of which are less directly relevant, I estimate a moderate probability of around 0.6 that the personality sketch is describing Adam if he was a computer science graduate student.
