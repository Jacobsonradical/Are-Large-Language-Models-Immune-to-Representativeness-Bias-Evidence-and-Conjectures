Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits could fit well with a computer science student. However, the sketch also emphasizes curiosity about nature, plants, animals and a warm heart, which are less directly related to computer science. Therefore, while there is a reasonable probability the sketch is describing a computer science student, I don't think it's a certainty based on the information provided.
