Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity, puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, are quite common among people who pursue graduate studies in computer science. However, the strong interest in nature and plants, as well as the deep love for animals, are less stereotypical for this field. Therefore, while there is a decent probability that Adam fits this personality profile as a computer science graduate student, it is not overwhelmingly likely. My estimate of 0.6 reflects a moderate probability.
