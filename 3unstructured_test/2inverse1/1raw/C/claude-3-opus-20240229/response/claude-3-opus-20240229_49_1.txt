Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, is empathetic, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While this could describe people in a variety of fields, the traits around curiosity, problem-solving, and abstract thinking align reasonably well with many people who choose to study computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature, plants and animals makes me think it could also describe someone in biology, zoology, or environmental science. Therefore, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch is describing a computer science graduate student.
