Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking, and highly intelligent. These traits could align with a computer science student. However, the strong empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are less stereotypically associated with computer science. Given the mix of traits, some of which fit a computer science profile and some of which don't, I estimate a moderate probability of around 0.6 that this sketch describes a computer science graduate student.
