Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch mentions curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals, which are not strongly associated with computer science. However, the mention of high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles has some overlap with traits that could suit a computer science student. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch is describing a computer science graduate student named Adam.
