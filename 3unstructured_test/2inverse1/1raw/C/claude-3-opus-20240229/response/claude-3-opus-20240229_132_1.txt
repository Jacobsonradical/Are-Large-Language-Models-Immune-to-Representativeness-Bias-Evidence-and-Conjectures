Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, empathetic, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to graduate students across many fields, they seem reasonably well-aligned with someone studying computer science. The curiosity, abstract thinking skills, and dedication are attributes that would serve a computer science student well. However, the strong interest in nature and animals is less directly relevant. Given these factors, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch is describing Adam as a computer science graduate student.
