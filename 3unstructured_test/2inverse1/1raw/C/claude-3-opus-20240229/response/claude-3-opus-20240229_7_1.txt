Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious, intelligent, empathetic, and appreciates hard work and abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to graduate students across many fields, they seem relatively well-aligned with someone studying computer science. Computer science requires strong analytical and problem-solving skills to grasp abstract concepts. At the same time, the mention of curiosity about nature and love for animals seems less directly relevant to computer science. Balancing these factors, I estimate a 60% probability that the sketch is describing Adam as a computer science grad student, but there is certainly uncertainty given the limited information provided.
