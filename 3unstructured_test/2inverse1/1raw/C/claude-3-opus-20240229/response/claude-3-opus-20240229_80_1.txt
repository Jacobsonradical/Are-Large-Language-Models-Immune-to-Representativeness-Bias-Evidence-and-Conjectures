Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, and has strong empathy - traits that could align with many computer science students. However, the strong interest in plants and animals makes me think it could also describe students in other fields like biology or environmental science. So while there is a reasonable chance the sketch is of a computer science student, I don't think it's a near certainty based on the information provided.
