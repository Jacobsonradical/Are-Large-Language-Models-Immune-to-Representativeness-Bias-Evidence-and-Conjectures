Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, which aligns well with a computer science student. The curiosity about nature and love of animals is less directly relevant but not incompatible. Overall, the description seems reasonably likely to fit a computer science grad student, so I estimate a 60% probability, but there is definitely uncertainty since the sketch doesn't mention anything definitively pointing to CS.
