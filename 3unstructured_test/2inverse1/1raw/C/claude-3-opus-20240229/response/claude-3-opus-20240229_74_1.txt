Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, which could fit well with studying computer science. However, the strong focus on curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy is less typical of computer science students compared to some other fields. So while it's certainly possible Adam studies computer science, I don't think this personality sketch provides especially strong evidence of that. My rough estimate is a 40% probability.
