Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in 2021 in the U.S.:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to some computer science students, they are not the most stereotypically associated traits for that field. The sketch does not mention specific interests or skills that are strongly predictive of studying computer science. Therefore, based on the limited information provided, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that this personality sketch is describing Adam if he was known to be a computer science graduate student.
