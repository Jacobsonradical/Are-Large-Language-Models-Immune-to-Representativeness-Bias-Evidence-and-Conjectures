Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking, and empathetic. While these qualities could apply to some computer science students, they seem more typical of students in fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps certain humanities and social science disciplines that involve abstract reasoning. The strong interest in plants, animals and nature is not as common among computer science students in my experience. So I would estimate a 40% chance the sketch is of a computer science student like Adam, but I think it's more likely to be a student in a field more directly related to nature and living things.
