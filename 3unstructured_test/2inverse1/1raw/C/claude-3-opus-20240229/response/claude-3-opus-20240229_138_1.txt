Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in computer science in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and is highly intelligent. While these qualities could apply to some computer science students, they seem more directly relevant to fields like biology, veterinary medicine, or environmental science. Computer science tends to attract those with strong math, logic and problem-solving skills. The sketch doesn't emphasize those traits as much. So while it's certainly possible Adam with this personality was a computer science grad student, I'd estimate only a modest 30% chance based solely on the information provided.
