Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch portrays someone who is curious, intelligent, empathetic, and appreciates hard work and abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to graduate students across many fields, they seem reasonably well-aligned with someone studying computer science. The puzzle-solving and abstract thinking aspects in particular fit the profile of many computer science students. However, the strong emphasis on a love of nature, plants and animals is less typical for this field, so I wouldn't assign a very high probability. 0.6 seems like a reasonable estimate that weighs the relevant traits without overstating the likelihood based on a short personality sketch. Of course, this is a very rough estimate given the limited information provided.
