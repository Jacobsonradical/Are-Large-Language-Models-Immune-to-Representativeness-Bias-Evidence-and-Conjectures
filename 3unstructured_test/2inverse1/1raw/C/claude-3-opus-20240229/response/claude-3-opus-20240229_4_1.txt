Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in computer science in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

This estimate is based on a few factors:
- The subject's curiosity about nature and love of animals isn't necessarily indicative of studying computer science, but isn't incompatible with it either.
- Enjoying puzzles and having high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts is quite consistent with studying computer science.
- An appreciation for hard work and dedication is fairly generic and could apply to most fields.

So while the description doesn't scream "computer science student", it seems reasonably probable that it could describe one, leading to my rough estimate of a 60% probability. But there's a good deal of uncertainty given the limited information provided.
