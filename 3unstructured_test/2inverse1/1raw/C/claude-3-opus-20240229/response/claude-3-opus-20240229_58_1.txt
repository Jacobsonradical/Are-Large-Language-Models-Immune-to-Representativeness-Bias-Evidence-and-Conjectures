Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic, loves animals, is intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While some of these traits like intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles could align with studying computer science, the strong emphasis on curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love of animals seems less typical of a computer science student relative to some other fields. So I estimate a 30% probability that this sketch describes a graduate student in computer science based on the information provided.
