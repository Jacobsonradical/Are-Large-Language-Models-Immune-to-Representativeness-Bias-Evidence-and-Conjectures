Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the assumption that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving aptitude, intelligence, and ability to grasp abstract concepts could align well with someone studying computer science. However, the strong empathy, love of nature/animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are less directly associated with stereotypical computer science traits. So while it's certainly possible the sketch is describing a computer science student, I don't feel it's a slam dunk based solely on the given information. I'd put the probability around 0.6, but there's definitely uncertainty there.
