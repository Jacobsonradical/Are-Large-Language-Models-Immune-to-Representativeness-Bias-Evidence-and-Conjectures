Here is my estimate of the probability that the given personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem well-aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information, I cannot say with 100% certainty that the sketch is describing Adam.
