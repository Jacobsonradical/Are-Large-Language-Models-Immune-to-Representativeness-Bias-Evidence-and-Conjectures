Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem well-aligned with someone pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that the sketch is describing Adam. However, there isn't quite enough specific information to say with near certainty that it must be him.
