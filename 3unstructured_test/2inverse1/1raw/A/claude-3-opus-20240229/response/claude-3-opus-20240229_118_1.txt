Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in the given field in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem well-aligned with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. The puzzle-solving ability and understanding of abstract concepts also fit. So while it's impossible to say definitively, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that this sketch could be describing Adam if he was in that field of study.
