Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and empathy for animals and nature, as well as an analytical and abstract mind. These traits seem quite compatible with graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more details about Adam's specific interests and background, I cannot say for certain that this was his field of study. Therefore, I estimate a 70% probability based on the limited information provided.
