Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, especially the curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem to align well with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking ability also fits. So I estimate a fairly high probability of around 0.7 that this personality sketch describes a graduate student in that field.
