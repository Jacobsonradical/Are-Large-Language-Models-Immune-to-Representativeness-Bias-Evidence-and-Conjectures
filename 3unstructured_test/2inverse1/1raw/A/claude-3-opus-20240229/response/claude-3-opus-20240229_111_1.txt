Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align well with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract reasoning skills and intelligence mentioned would also be an asset in this field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.75 that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
