Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem well-aligned with someone pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.8 that this sketch would match Adam's personality if that was his field of study.
