Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, I estimate there is a high probability of around 80% that this sketch describes Adam if he was in that field of study.
