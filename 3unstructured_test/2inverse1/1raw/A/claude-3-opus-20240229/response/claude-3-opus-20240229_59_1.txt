Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align well with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information, I cannot say with certainty that the sketch is describing Adam. Therefore, I estimate a 70% probability based on the limited information provided.
