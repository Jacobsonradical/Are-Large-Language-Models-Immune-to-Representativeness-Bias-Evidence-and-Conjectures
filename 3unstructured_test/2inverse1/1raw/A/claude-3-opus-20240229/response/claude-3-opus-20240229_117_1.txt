Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate there is a relatively high probability of around 80% that the sketch is describing Adam if he was in that field of study.
