Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and Adam's field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem well-aligned with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information, I cannot say this with certainty, so I estimate a 70% probability.
