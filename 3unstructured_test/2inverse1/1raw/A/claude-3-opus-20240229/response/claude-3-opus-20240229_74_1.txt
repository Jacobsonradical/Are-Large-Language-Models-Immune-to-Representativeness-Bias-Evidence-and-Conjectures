Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021 in the U.S.:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation of hard work and dedication seem well-aligned with someone pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific details, I cannot say with 100% certainty that the sketch refers to Adam.
