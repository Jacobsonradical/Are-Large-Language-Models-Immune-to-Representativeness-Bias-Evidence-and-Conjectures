Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate there is a high probability of around 80% that this sketch would describe Adam if he was in that field of study.
