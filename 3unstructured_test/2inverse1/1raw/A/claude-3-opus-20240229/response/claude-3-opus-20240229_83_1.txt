Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem quite well-aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that this sketch describes Adam if he was in that field of study. However, there is still some uncertainty, as the traits could also fit other fields.
