Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits described, especially the curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem very well aligned with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. So I believe there is a high probability, around 80%, that this sketch could be describing Adam if that was his field of graduate study.
