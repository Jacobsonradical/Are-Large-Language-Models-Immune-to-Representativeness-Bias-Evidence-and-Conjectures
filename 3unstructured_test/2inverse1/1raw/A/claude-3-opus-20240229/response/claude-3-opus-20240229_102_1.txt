Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align well with a graduate student pursuing agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate there is a high probability of around 0.8 that the sketch is describing Adam if he was in that field of study.
