Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with someone likely to pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.8 that this sketch describes Adam if he was in that field of study.
