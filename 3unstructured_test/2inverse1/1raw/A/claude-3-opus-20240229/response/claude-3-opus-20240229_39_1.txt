Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work. These traits seem well-aligned with a graduate student studying agricultural and veterinary science. The curiosity about nature, plants and animals in particular suggests an interest in this field of study. The strong empathy also fits with a desire to care for the health and wellbeing of animals. High intelligence and abstract thinking abilities are important for graduate-level scientific study and research. And dedication and strong work ethic are needed to complete an advanced degree. So while it's impossible to say definitively, the personality traits described make it quite likely in my estimation, around 80% probability, that Adam was a grad student in agricultural and veterinary science based on the given sketch.
