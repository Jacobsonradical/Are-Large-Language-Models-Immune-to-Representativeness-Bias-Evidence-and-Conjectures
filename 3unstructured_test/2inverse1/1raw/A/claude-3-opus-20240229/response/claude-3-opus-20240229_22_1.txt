Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem very well aligned with someone pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. So I believe there is a high probability, around 80%, that this sketch would fit Adam if that was his field of study.
