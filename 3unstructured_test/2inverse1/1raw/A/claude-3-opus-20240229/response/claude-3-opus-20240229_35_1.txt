Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem to align well with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.8 that this sketch is describing Adam if he was in that field of study.
