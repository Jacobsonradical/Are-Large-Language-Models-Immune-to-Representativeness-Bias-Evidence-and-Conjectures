Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, which mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, I believe there is a reasonably high probability (around 70%) that Adam was enrolled in an agricultural and veterinary science graduate program. His interests and attributes align well with that field of study. However, without more specific information, I cannot say with certainty that this was his area of graduate study.
