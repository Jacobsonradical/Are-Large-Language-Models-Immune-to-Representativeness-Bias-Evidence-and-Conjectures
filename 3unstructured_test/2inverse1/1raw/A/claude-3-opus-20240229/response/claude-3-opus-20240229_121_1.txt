Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and a good understanding of hard work and dedication. These qualities align well with a graduate student pursuing agricultural and veterinary science. The empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature especially point towards this field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.8 that this describes Adam if he was an agricultural and veterinary science graduate student in 2021.
