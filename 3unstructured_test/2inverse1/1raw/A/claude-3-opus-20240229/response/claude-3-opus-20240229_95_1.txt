Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a deep curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work. These traits seem well-aligned with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. The interest in nature, plants and animals along with strong abstract thinking skills suggest a good fit for this field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively high 75% probability that the sketch describes Adam if he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student.
