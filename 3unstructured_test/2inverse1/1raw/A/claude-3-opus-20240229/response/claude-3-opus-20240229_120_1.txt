Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits described, particularly the curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem well-aligned with someone pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate there is a relatively high probability (0.8) that this sketch is describing Adam if he was in that field of study.
