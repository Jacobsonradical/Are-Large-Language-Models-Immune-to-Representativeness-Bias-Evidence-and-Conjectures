Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in graduate school in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem well-aligned with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. While not definitive, there appears to be a high probability of a match based on the limited information provided.
