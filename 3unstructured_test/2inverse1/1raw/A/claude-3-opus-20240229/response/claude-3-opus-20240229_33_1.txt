Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, align well with someone who would be drawn to studying agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate there is a fairly high probability of around 80% that this sketch would match Adam if he was a graduate student in that field.
