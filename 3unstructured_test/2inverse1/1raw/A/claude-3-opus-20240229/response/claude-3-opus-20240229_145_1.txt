Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication, align quite well with someone who would be drawn to studying agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract reasoning skills also fit. So I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that this sketch would match Adam if he was in that field of study.
