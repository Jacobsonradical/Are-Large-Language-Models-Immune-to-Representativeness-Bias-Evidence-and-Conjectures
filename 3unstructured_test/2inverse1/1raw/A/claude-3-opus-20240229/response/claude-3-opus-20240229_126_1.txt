Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem quite well-aligned with someone who would pursue graduate studies in the agricultural and veterinary science field. However, without more specific information, I cannot say with certainty that the sketch is definitely describing Adam, so I estimate the probability to be around 70%.
