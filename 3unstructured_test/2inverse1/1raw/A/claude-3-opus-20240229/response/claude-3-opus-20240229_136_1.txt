Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as an empathetic and caring disposition. They also have high intelligence and excel at understanding abstract concepts. Given these traits, I believe there is a reasonably high probability, around 70%, that the person described was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021. This field of study aligns well with the stated interests and qualities of the individual in the personality sketch.
