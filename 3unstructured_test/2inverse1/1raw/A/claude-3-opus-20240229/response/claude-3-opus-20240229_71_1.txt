Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem well-aligned with someone who might pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information, I cannot say with certainty that Adam was enrolled in this field, so I have provided a probability estimate of 0.7.
