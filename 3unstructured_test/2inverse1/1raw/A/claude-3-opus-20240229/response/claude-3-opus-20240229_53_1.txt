Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem well-aligned with a graduate student pursuing agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information, I cannot say with 100% certainty that this was Adam's field of study.
