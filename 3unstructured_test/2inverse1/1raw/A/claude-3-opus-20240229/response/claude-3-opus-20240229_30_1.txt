Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, animals and abstract concepts. They are also empathetic, intelligent and hardworking. While this profile could fit students in a variety of fields, it seems to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The combination of curiosity about nature/plants, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication makes me think there is a reasonably high probability, around 70%, that the sketch is describing Adam if he was in this particular graduate program.
