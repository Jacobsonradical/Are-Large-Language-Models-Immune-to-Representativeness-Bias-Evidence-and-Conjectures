Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and a good grasp of abstract concepts. These traits seem well-aligned with a graduate student pursuing agricultural and veterinary science. The empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication also fit this field. However, without more specific information, I cannot say with certainty that the sketch is definitely describing Adam or his exact field of study, so I estimate a 70% probability.
