Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, seem to align well with someone pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information, I cannot say with 100% certainty that the sketch is about Adam. A probability of 0.8 reflects a high likelihood based on the available information, while allowing for some uncertainty.
