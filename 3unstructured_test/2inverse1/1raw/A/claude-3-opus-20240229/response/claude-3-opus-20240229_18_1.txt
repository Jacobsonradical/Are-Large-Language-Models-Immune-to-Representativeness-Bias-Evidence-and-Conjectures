Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific details, I cannot say with certainty that the sketch is about Adam, so I estimate a 70% probability.
