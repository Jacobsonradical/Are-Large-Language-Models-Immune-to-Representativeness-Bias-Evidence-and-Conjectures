Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in the given field in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, seem to align well with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information, I cannot say with certainty that the sketch is about Adam, so I estimate a 70% probability.
