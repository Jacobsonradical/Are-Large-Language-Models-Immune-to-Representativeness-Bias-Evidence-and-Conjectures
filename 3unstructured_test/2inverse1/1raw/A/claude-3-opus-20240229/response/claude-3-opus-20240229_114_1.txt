Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem well-aligned with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information, I cannot say definitively that the sketch is describing Adam, so I estimate the probability at 0.7 rather than a near-certainty.
