Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem very well aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that this sketch would match Adam's personality if he was enrolled in that field of study.
