Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem well-aligned with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information, I cannot say with certainty that the sketch is describing Adam, so I estimate the probability as 0.7 rather than higher.
