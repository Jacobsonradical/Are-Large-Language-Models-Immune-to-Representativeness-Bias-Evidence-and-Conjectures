Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with a graduate student pursuing agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific details, I cannot be certain the sketch is describing Adam, so I estimate a 70% probability based on the limited information provided.
