Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem well-aligned with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking and intelligence mentioned also fit well with graduate-level studies in a scientific field. So I estimate a relatively high probability of around 0.8 that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
