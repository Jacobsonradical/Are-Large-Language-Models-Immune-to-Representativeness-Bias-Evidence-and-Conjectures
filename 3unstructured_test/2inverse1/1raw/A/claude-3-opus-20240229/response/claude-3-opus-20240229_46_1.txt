Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem very well aligned with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a high probability of around 80% that this sketch would fit Adam if that was his field of study.
