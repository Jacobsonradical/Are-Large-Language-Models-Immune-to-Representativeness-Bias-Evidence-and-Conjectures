Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions several traits that align well with a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, including a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. The sketch also notes high intelligence and abstract thinking ability, which are important for graduate-level studies. While not definitive, these attributes make it quite likely in my estimation that the subject of the sketch could be Adam if he was an agricultural and veterinary science grad student.
