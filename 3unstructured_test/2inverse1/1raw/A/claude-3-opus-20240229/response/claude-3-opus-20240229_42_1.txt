Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem well-aligned with someone likely to pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a fairly high 70% probability that the sketch could be describing Adam if that was his field of study, based on the limited information provided.
