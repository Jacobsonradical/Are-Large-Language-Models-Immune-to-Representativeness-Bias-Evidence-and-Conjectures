Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The other traits like intelligence, empathy and enjoying puzzles also seem compatible with this field of study. So while not conclusive, I estimate a fairly high 70% probability the sketch is describing Adam if he was in this graduate program.
