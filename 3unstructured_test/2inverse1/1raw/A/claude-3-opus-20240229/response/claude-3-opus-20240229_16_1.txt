Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits that would align well with someone pursuing agricultural and veterinary science, such as curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. So I estimate there is a fairly high probability (around 80%) that the sketch could be describing Adam if he was a graduate student in that field.
