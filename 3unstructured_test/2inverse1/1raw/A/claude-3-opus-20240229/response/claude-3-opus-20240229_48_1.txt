Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem well-aligned with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific details, there is still some uncertainty, so I estimate the probability to be around 70%.
