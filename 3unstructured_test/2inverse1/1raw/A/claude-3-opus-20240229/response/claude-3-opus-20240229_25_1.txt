Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific details, I cannot say with certainty that the sketch is definitely describing Adam, so I estimate a 70% probability based on the limited information provided.
