Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem well-aligned with a graduate student pursuing agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, I estimate there is a relatively high probability of around 80% that this sketch would fit Adam if that was his field of graduate study.
