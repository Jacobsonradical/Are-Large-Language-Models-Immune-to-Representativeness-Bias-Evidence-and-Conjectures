Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem well-aligned with someone who may pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information, there is still some uncertainty, which is why I estimated the probability at 0.7 rather than higher.
