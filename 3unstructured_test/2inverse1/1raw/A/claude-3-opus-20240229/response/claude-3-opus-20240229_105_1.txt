Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a relatively high probability of 80% that this sketch would match Adam if that was his field of graduate study.
