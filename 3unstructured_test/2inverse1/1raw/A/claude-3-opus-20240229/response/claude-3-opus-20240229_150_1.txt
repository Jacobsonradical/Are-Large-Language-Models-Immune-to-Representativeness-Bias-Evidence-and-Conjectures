Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the specified graduate field of study for Adam in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, empathy and love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific information, there is still some uncertainty, so I estimate the probability at 0.7 rather than higher.
