Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, if he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem well-aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The other traits like intelligence, empathy and enjoying puzzles also seem compatible. So I estimate a fairly high 70% probability the sketch is describing Adam if he was in this field of study.
