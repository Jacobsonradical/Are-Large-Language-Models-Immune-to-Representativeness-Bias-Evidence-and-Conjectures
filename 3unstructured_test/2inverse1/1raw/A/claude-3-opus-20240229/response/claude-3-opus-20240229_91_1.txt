Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work. These traits align well with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. The combination of interest in nature, animals, and hard science makes this field seem like a probable fit for the person described. However, without more specific information, I cannot say for certain this was Adam's field of study, so I estimate a 70% probability.
