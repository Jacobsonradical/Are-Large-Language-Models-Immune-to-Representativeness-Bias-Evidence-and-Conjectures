Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem quite compatible with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The focus on nature, plants, animals and applying intelligence and hard work to these fields leads me to estimate a relatively high 70% probability that this sketch would match a graduate student like Adam in that field of study.
