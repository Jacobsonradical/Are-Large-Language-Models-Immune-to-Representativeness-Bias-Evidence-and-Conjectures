Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem very well-aligned with someone who would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. However, without more specific details, I cannot say with 100% certainty that the sketch is referring to Adam. Therefore, I estimate the probability to be around 0.8 or 80%.
