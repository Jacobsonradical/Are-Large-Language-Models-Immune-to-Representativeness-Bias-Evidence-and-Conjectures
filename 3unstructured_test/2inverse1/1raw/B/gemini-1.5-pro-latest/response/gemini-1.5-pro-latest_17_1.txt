  "business administration": "0.3"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While the personality sketch describes someone intelligent and capable of understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to business administration, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and love for animals suggests a stronger inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. 

A business administration student might be drawn to puzzles and problem-solving, but the core interests described don't strongly align with the field. 

Therefore, a probability of 0.3 reflects a low-to-moderate chance that the sketch is about Adam in business administration.
