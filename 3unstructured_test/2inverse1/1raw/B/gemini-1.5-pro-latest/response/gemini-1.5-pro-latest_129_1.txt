**Explanation:**

While the personality sketch doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, several traits point towards Adam being more likely enrolled in a field related to science, research, or perhaps even veterinary medicine.  Here's why:

* **"Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"** suggests an interest in biology, environmental science, or a related field.
* **"Enjoys solving puzzles... high intelligence... good at understanding abstract concepts"** indicates an aptitude for analytical and problem-solving skills, valuable in various fields, but aligning well with scientific disciplines.
* **"Deep love for animals"** could suggest an interest in veterinary medicine or animal sciences. 

Business administration programs often attract individuals with strong interpersonal skills, leadership qualities, and an interest in finance and management.  While Adam's empathy could be valuable in a business context, his core interests, as described, make a science-related field more probable. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.2 (or 20%) acknowledges that it's possible Adam was studying business administration, but less likely given the overall profile.**
