**Explanation:**

While the description of Adam doesn't explicitly exclude him from studying business administration, the emphasis on his love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles suggests a stronger inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, or even computer science. 

A probability of 0.2 (or 20%) reflects this:

* **Low probability:** The personality sketch leans away from traits typically associated with someone drawn to business administration, such as a strong interest in finance, marketing, or management.
* **Still possible:**  People's interests and career choices can be complex. It's possible Adam could be pursuing a unique path within business administration, perhaps focused on sustainable business practices or environmental management. 

**Important Note:** This is just an educated guess based on limited information. A more accurate assessment would require more details about Adam's background, skills, and aspirations.
