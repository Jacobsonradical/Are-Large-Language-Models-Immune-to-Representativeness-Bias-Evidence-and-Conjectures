  "business administration": "0.3"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the description paints a picture of an intelligent and empathetic person, it leans heavily towards interests in nature, problem-solving, and possibly science.  

* **Business administration** programs often attract people interested in management, finance, and practical business applications. 
* **The personality sketch doesn't directly contradict** a business administration path, but it doesn't strongly support it either.  

**A 0.3 probability (30%)** represents a moderate chance.  Adam *could* be in business administration, perhaps focusing on sustainability or a related field, but it's not the most likely scenario based on the description.
