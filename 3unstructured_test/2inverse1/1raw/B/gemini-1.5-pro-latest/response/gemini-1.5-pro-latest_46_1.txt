**Reasoning:**

While the description highlights intelligence, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, which are valuable in business, the core passions described (nature, animals, potentially puzzles as problem-solving) point away from a strong likelihood of Adam being in business administration.  

Here's why the probability is set relatively low, but not extremely low:

* **Transferable Skills:**  Intelligence, problem-solving, and empathy are useful in business, so it's not impossible.
* **Individual Variation:** People in business administration are not a monolith; some may have strong interests outside the field.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate.  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of academic fields.
