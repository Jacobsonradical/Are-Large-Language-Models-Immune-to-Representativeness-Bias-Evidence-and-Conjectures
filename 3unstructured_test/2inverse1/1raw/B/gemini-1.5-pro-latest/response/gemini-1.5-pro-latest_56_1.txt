  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the description hints at certain traits that could be found in someone pursuing business administration (intelligence, understanding hard work), it leans more heavily towards interests and values often associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine (love for animals, curiosity about nature). 

A probability of 0.3 represents a relatively low chance, acknowledging that some individuals in business administration might possess the described traits, but it's not the most likely field given the information.
