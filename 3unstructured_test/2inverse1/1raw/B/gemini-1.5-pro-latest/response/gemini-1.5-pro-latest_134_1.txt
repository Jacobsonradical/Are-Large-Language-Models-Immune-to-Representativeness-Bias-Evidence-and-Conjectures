**Reasoning:**

While someone with Adam's personality traits could certainly end up in business administration, the description leans more heavily towards interests aligned with science or perhaps humanities/social sciences.  Here's why:

* **"Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"** suggests a stronger affinity for fields like biology, environmental science, or even botany. 
* **"Enjoys solving puzzles...high intelligence...understanding abstract concepts"**  indicates an aptitude for analytical and problem-solving fields. This could fit with business, but it's also highly relevant to STEM fields.
* **"Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals"** might suggest career paths focused on working with people or animals directly, though not exclusively.

**Therefore, a probability of 0.2 (or 20%) reflects a relatively low chance that Adam's graduate studies were specifically in business administration, given the stronger indicators towards other areas.**
