**Reasoning:**

While some traits like intelligence, problem-solving skills, and work ethic are valuable in business administration, the sketch heavily emphasizes Adam's affinity for nature, animals, and potentially abstract concepts. These lean more towards fields like biology, environmental science, or even something like theoretical physics. 

A business administration student is less likely to have such a pronounced interest in nature and animals. Hence, a probability of 0.2 (representing a relatively low chance) seems appropriate.
