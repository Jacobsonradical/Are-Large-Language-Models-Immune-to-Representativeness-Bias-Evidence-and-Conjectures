**Explanation:**

While someone studying business administration *could* have the personality traits described, it's not the most likely field given the strong emphasis on nature, animals, and potentially abstract concepts.  A field in biology, environmental science, or even something like data analysis related to those fields would be a more likely fit.  

A probability of 0.2 (or 20%) suggests it's possible, but not the most probable scenario.
