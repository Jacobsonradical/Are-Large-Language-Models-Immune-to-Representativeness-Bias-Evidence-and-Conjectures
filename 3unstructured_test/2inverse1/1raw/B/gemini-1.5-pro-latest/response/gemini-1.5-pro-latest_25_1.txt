**Reasoning:**

While the description fits some common stereotypes of people interested in nature and animals (e.g., caring, empathetic), it lacks strong indicators that would definitively point towards or away from a business administration student.  

* **Points in Favor:** Intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding hard work are valuable in business. 
* **Points Against:**  The description emphasizes nature, animals, and abstract concepts, which are not typical focuses in business administration programs. 

**Overall:** The probability is slightly lower than average (0.5), as the profile leans slightly away from a typical business administration student. However, it's certainly possible for someone with these interests to study business.
