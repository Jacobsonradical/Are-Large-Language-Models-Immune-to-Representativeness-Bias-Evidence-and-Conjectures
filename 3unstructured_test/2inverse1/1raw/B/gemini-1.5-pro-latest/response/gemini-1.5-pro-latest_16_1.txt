  "business administration": "0.2"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While someone with Adam's personality traits *could* study business administration, it's less likely than some other fields.  Here's why:

* **Stronger indicators for other fields:**  His love of nature, animals, and abstract concepts points more towards fields like biology, environmental science, or even something like theoretical physics. 
* **Business administration is broad:**  While business administration requires intelligence and hard work, it doesn't inherently align with his core interests as described.
* **Lack of direct correlation:** There's nothing in the description specifically suggesting an interest in business, finance, or management.

**0.2 (20%)** represents a low probability, acknowledging it's possible but statistically less likely given the personality profile.
