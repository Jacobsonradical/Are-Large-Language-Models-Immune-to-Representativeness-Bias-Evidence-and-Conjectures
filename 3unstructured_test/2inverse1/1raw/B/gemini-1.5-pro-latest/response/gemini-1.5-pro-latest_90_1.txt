}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the description points towards someone who might be drawn to scientific fields like biology or environmental studies, it's not impossible for someone with these traits to pursue business administration. 

Here's why:

* **Intelligence and Abstract Concepts:** These are valuable in business strategy and analysis.
* **Empathy and Understanding of Hard Work:**  Important for leadership and managing teams.
* **Problem-Solving:** A core skill in many business roles.

However, the strong emphasis on nature and lack of direct mentions of business interests make it less likely. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.3 (30%) represents a moderate chance that the personality sketch describes someone in business administration.**
