**Explanation:**

While the personality sketch doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, it leans heavily towards interests and traits often associated with scientific or nature-related fields.  Here's why:

* **"Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"** and **"deep love for animals"** suggest a stronger affinity for environmental science, biology, or a related field. 
* **"Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles"** and **"good at understanding abstract concepts"**  could apply to business administration, but are also common in fields like mathematics, computer science, or engineering. 

A business administration student could certainly have these interests, but it's less common than in fields directly related to the traits mentioned. Therefore, the probability is relatively low, but not impossible.
