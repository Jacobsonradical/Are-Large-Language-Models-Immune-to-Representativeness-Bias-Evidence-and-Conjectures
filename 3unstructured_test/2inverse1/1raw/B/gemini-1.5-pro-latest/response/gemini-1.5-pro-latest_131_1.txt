  "business administration": "0.3"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While the personality sketch doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, it leans towards a more scientifically or nature-oriented individual.  Here's why:

* **Curiosity about nature and plants:**  This points towards interests more aligned with biology, environmental science, or even agriculture.
* **Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts:** These traits are valuable in many fields, including business, but are strong indicators of an affinity for analytical and problem-solving disciplines.
* **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals:** These qualities could lead to careers in fields like veterinary science, animal care, or social work, but they don't directly relate to business administration. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.3 (30%) seems reasonable. **  

It's important to note that this is just an estimate based on limited information. There's a chance Adam could be passionate about sustainable business practices or have a unique career path combining his interests.
