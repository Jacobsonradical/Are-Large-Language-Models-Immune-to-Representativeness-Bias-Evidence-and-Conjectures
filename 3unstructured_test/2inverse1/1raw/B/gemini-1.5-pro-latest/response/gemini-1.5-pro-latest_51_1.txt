  "business administration": "0.2"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While the personality sketch doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, the traits described (love for nature, empathy, enjoyment of puzzles, understanding of abstract concepts) align more strongly with fields like biology, environmental science, or even something like computer science. 

Here's why I chose a probability of 0.2:

* **Possible, but less likely:** It's certainly possible for someone interested in nature and animals to pursue business administration, perhaps with a focus on sustainability or ethical business practices. 
* **Traits not as strong of indicators:** The sketch doesn't highlight traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, ambition, or a strong interest in finance or economics.

Therefore, a 20% probability acknowledges the possibility, but reflects that it's not the most likely field for Adam based on the provided information.
