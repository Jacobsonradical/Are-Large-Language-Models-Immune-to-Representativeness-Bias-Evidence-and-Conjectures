```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the description does not explicitly exclude business administration, it leans heavily towards a personality drawn to nature, empathy (animals), and abstract concepts. These are not traits stereotypically associated with someone pursuing a business administration degree. However, people are diverse and Adam could be interested in sustainable business practices or non-profit management. Therefore, the probability is low but not impossible.
