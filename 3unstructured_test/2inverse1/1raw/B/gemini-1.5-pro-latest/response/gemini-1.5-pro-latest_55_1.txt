**Explanation:**

While the description highlights intelligence, empathy, and appreciation for hard work - traits found in successful businesspeople - the emphasis on nature, animals, and puzzle-solving suggests a stronger inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, or even computer science/mathematics. 

A business administration program could attract students with diverse interests, so a probability of 0.3 reflects the possibility, albeit lower, that Adam might have chosen this path.
