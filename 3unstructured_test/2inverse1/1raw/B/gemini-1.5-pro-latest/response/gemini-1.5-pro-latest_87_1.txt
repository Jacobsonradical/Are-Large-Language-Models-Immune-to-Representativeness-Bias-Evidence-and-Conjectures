  "business administration": "0.2"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While the personality sketch doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, several aspects point towards a lower probability:

* **"Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"** and **"deep love for animals"** suggest interests more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. 
* **"Quiet boy"** could fit various fields, but the overall profile leans less towards the typically more extroverted and networking-heavy nature of business administration.

A probability of 0.2 (20%) acknowledges that it's possible Adam could be in business administration, perhaps with a focus on sustainability or ethical business practices, but it's less likely given the described traits.
