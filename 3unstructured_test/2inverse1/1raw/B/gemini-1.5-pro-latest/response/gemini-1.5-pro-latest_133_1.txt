**Reasoning:**

While the description paints a picture of an intelligent and empathetic person, these traits are not exclusive to any particular field.  Here's why the probability for business administration is relatively low:

* **Strong nature focus:** The emphasis on nature, plants, and animals is not typical of someone drawn to business administration.  
* **Puzzles and abstract concepts:** While business involves problem-solving, the description highlights a preference for puzzles and abstract thinking, which might be more common in fields like mathematics, science, or engineering. 
* **Appreciation for hard work:** This is a general trait and doesn't specifically point towards business administration.

**It's important to note:** This is just an estimated probability based on limited information. There's a chance Adam could be in business administration, perhaps with a focus on sustainability or ethical business practices.
