**Reasoning:**

While someone with the described traits could certainly end up in business administration, the personality sketch leans heavily towards interests more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or even potentially something like engineering (given the puzzle-solving aspect). 

Here's why a lower probability is assigned to business administration:

* **Strong nature theme:**  The emphasis on "nature and its various plants" and "deep love for animals" suggests interests that are not typically central to business administration programs.
* **Abstract concepts and puzzles:** While relevant to business, these traits are also highly applicable to STEM fields, which align better with the overall sketch. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective estimate.  Without more information about Adam's specific goals or background, it's impossible to give a precise probability.
