{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While the description paints a picture of an intelligent and empathetic individual, the traits highlighted (love for nature, puzzle-solving, love for animals, understanding abstract concepts) align more strongly with fields like biology, environmental science, or even potentially psychology.  

A business administration program could attract individuals with these traits, but it's not the most likely fit. Hence, a probability of 0.2 (representing a lower chance) seems appropriate.
