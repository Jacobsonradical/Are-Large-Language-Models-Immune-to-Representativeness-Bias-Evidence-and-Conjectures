  "business administration": "0.3"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the personality sketch doesn't explicitly contradict someone interested in business administration, some aspects make it less likely:

* **"Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants"**: This suggests an affinity for natural sciences, not typically associated with business administration. 
* **"Quiet boy"**:  While not impossible, business fields often attract those comfortable with networking and active communication.
* **"Deep love for animals"**: This could indicate a career path related to animals or environment, less common in traditional business.

**However:**

* **"High intelligence", "good at understanding abstract concepts"**: These traits are useful in business administration.
* **"Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication"**: This is valuable in many fields, including business.

**Conclusion:**

The probability is not extremely low, as the intelligence and work ethic aspects could fit. However, the nature-oriented and quiet aspects make it less likely than someone pursuing environmental studies, biology, or similar fields. A probability of 0.3 reflects this balance - possible, but not the most likely scenario.
