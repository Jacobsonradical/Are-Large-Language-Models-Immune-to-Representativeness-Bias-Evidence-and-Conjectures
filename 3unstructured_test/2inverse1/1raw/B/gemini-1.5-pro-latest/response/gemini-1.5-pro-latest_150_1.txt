**Explanation:**

While the personality sketch doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, it heavily suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, animals, or potentially abstract problem-solving. 

Here's why the probability is relatively low:

* **Strong nature affinity:**  The description emphasizes a "genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" and a "deep love for animals." These traits are more common among individuals pursuing biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or similar fields. 
* **Puzzle-solving and abstract thinking:** While applicable to business, these skills are also highly relevant to STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, mathematics).  
* **Lack of business-oriented traits:** The sketch lacks typical indicators of business interest, such as leadership, competitiveness, risk-taking, or a focus on finance and economics. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.2 (20%) reflects that it's possible, but less likely, that Adam's graduate studies were in business administration given the provided personality sketch.**
