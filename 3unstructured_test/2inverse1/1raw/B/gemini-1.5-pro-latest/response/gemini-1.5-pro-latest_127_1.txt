**Explanation:**

While the personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, empathetic, and enjoys problem-solving, these traits are not exclusive to any particular field.  

* **Business administration** often attracts people interested in leadership, management, finance, and economics. While Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills could be applicable, his passion for nature and animals suggests a stronger affinity for a different field. 

* A 0.3 probability indicates a low to moderate chance. Adam *could* be studying business administration, but it's less likely given his described interests.
