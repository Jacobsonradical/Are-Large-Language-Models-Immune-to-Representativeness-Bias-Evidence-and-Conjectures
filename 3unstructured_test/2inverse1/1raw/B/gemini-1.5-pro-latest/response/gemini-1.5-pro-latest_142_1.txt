  "business administration": "0.3"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While some traits mentioned (intelligence, problem-solving) are useful in business administration, the sketch heavily emphasizes nature, empathy, and a love for animals. These are not typical drivers for choosing a business career. 

A 0.3 probability (30%) represents a low-to-moderate chance. Adam *could* be in business administration, but it's not the most likely fit based on his personality description.
