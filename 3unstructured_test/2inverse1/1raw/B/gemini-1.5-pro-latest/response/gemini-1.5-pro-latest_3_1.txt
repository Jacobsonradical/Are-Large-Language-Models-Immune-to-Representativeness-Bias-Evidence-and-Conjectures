{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While the description points to a curious and intelligent individual, it leans heavily towards interests in nature, empathy (potentially social sciences), and understanding complex systems. These traits are not exclusive to any field, but they are less typical of someone drawn to the core aspects of business administration like finance, marketing, or management. 

A 0.3 probability represents a low-to-moderate chance.  Here's why:

* **Lower Probability:** The emphasis on nature and animals doesn't align strongly with typical business interests. 
* **Moderate Probability:** High intelligence, problem-solving, and understanding hard work are valuable in business, leaving a possibility that Adam could be in a more analytical or specialized area within business administration.
