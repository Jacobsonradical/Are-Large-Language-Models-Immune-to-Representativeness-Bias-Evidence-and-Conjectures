  "business administration": "0.2"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While someone interested in nature and animals *could* pursue business administration, the personality sketch leans towards interests more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. 

Here's why I chose 0.2:

* **Low Correlation:** The traits mentioned (love for nature, empathy, puzzle-solving) have a low direct correlation with typical business administration interests (finance, marketing, management). 
* **Possible Overlap:**  There's a small chance Adam could be interested in sustainable business practices, environmental management, or ethical business, which would combine his interests with business administration.  

A probability of 0.2 (20%) reflects this low correlation while acknowledging the possibility of overlap.
