**Explanation:**

While the description highlights Adam's intelligence, empathy, and appreciation for hard work – traits that can be found in successful business people – his passion for nature, puzzles, and animals suggests a stronger inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, or even veterinary medicine. 

A business administration program might attract students with a different primary interest, such as finance, marketing, or management.

Therefore, the probability of this sketch being about Adam in a business administration program is relatively low, but not impossible. Hence, a probability of **0.3 (30%)** seems reasonable.
