  "business administration": "0.3"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the personality sketch doesn't explicitly exclude business administration, several aspects point towards a lower probability:

* **"Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"** and **"deep love for animals"**  suggest interests more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. 
* **"Quiet boy"** might indicate a preference for less outwardly focused fields than the stereotype of business administration.

However, some aspects leave room for the possibility:

* **"High intelligence"** and **"good at understanding abstract concepts"** are valuable in business administration.
* **"Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication"** are also desirable traits.

Therefore, a probability of **0.3** represents a low to moderate chance that Adam, with these characteristics, was enrolled in business administration.
