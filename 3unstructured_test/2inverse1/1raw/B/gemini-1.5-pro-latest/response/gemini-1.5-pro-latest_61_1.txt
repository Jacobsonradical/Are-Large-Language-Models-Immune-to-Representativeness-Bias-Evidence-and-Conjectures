{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While the description paints a picture of an intelligent and empathetic individual, these traits are not exclusive to any particular field. Here's why the probability for business administration is relatively low:

* **Strong Nature Focus:** The emphasis on nature and animals doesn't strongly correlate with typical business administration interests.
* **Puzzle Solving:** While applicable to business, this trait is common in many fields, including STEM, which aligns better with the "abstract concepts" element. 
* **Hard work and dedication:**  Again, this is a positive quality found in many successful individuals across fields.

**Why not lower?**

* Some business tracks (like sustainable business or ethical supply chain management) might attract individuals interested in nature and empathy.
* Intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in the business world. 

Therefore, a probability of 0.3 suggests it's possible but not the most likely field for someone with this personality sketch.
