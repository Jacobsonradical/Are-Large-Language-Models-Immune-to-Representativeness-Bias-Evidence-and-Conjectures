  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Explanation:**

While the description aligns with some traits found in business administration graduates (problem-solving, intelligence), it leans more heavily towards interests like biology, environmental science, or even veterinary medicine. 

Here's why 0.3 is a reasonable estimate:

* **Nature and Animal Emphasis:** The strong focus on nature and animals isn't typical of someone drawn to business administration. 
* **Abstract Concepts:** While useful in business, the phrasing suggests a more scientific inclination.
* **Hard Work and Dedication:** This is universal and doesn't specifically point to business.

A business administration student *could* have these interests, so the probability isn't extremely low. However, it's more likely this personality sketch describes a student in a different field.
