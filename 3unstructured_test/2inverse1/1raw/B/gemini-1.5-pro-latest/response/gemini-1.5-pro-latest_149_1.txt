  "business administration": "0.3"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While the personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, empathetic, and enjoys solving problems, these traits are not exclusive to a single field.  Here's why 0.3 is a reasonable estimate:

* **Positive Correlations:**  Intelligence, problem-solving skills, and an appreciation for hard work are certainly valuable in business administration. 
* **Possible Disconnect:**  The strong emphasis on nature, animals, and potentially abstract concepts (which could hint at a more scientific inclination) might be less common focuses for someone drawn to business administration.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise.  Personality sketches offer very limited information, and people's interests and career choices are complex. A true probability assessment would require much more data about Adam and the typical profiles of business administration students.
