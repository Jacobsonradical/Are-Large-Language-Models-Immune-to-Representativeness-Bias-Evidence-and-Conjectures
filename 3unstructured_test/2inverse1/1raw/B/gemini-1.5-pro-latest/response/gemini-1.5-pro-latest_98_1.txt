**Explanation:**

While the description of Adam doesn't explicitly exclude him from studying business administration, several aspects make it somewhat less likely:

* **"Genuine curiosity about nature and plants"** suggests an affinity for natural sciences or related fields. 
* **"Quiet boy"** might indicate introversion, which isn't a barrier but isn't as stereotypical in the business world compared to, say, research. 
* **"Love for animals"** could hint at interests in veterinary science or zoology.

However:

* **"High intelligence," "understanding abstract concepts,"** and **"appreciation for hard work"** are all qualities valuable in business administration. 

Therefore, a low probability (0.2) reflects that while the profile leans away from a typical business student, it's not impossible, and Adam could be pursuing a specialized area within business related to sustainability, environmental management, or social entrepreneurship.
