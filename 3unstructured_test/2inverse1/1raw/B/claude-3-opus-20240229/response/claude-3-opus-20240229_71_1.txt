Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, do not seem to strongly align with typical traits of graduate students in business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits to pursue that field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that the sketch is about Adam if he was in this graduate program.
