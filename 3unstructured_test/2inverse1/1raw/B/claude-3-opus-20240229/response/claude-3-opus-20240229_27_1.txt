Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and is good at abstract thinking. While these traits could apply to some people studying business administration, they seem more typical of someone in a field like biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or philosophy. Business administration students often tend to be more interested in leadership, management, finance, and organizations. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying business administration, I'd estimate only a moderate probability of around 0.3 given the details in the personality sketch.
