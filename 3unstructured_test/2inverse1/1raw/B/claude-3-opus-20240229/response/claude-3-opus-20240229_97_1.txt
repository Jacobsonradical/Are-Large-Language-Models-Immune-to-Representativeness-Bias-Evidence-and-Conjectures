Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, if he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an ability to understand abstract concepts. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem more typical of someone in a field like biology, zoology, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or philosophy. Business administration programs tend to focus more on practical applications in management, finance, accounting, etc. So while not impossible, I estimate a relatively low 30% probability that the sketch is describing a business administration graduate student.
