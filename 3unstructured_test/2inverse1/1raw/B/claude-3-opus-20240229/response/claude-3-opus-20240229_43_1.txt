Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the specified field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or mathematics rather than business administration. However, qualities like intelligence, understanding of hard work, and problem-solving skills could be relevant in a business context. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that the subject of this personality sketch was a business administration graduate student, given the information provided.
