Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While some of these traits could apply to a graduate student in business administration, the strong focus on curiosity about plants and animals, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving seems more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or computer science. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying business, I'd estimate the probability is only around 0.3 based on the given personality sketch.
