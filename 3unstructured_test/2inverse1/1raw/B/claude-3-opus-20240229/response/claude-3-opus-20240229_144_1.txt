Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, as well as a quiet demeanor. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits and interests, they seem less likely to be emphasized in that field compared to others like biology, zoology, mathematics, etc. Business administration tends to be a more people-focused and practical rather than abstract field. So while not impossible, I estimate a relatively low 30% probability that the sketch is describing Adam as a business administration graduate student.
