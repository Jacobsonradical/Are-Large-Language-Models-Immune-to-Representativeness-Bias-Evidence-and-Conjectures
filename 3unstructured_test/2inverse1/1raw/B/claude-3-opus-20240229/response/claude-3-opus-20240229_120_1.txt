Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Based on the traits described, the personality sketch seems more aligned with someone studying a field related to natural sciences, such as biology, ecology, or zoology. It's less likely, though still possible, that the sketch would describe a graduate student in a business-related field like business administration.
