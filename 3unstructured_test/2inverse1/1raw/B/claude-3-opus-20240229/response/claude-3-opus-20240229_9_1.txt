Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, plants, and animals, enjoys puzzles and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem more typical of someone in a field related to the natural sciences, mathematics, or perhaps certain humanities fields. So I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch is of a business administration graduate student.
