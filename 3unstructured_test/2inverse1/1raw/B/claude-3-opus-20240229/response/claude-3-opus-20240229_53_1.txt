Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, are not typically the most emphasized traits for someone pursuing graduate studies in business administration. However, qualities like intelligence, dedication, and hard work could certainly apply. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that this specific personality sketch would describe a graduate student in business administration.
