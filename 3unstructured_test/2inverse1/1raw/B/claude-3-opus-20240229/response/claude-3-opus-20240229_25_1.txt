Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and abstract thinking ability, seem less typical of someone pursuing graduate studies in business administration compared to some other fields. However, it's certainly possible for a business student to have those qualities. The 30% probability reflects that it's plausible but not the most likely fit given the details provided.
