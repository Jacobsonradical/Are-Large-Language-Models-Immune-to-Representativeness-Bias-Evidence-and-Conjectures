Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy and love for animals, is intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary science, or psychology. Business administration students often have interests in leadership, finance, management, and entrepreneurship. So while it's certainly possible Adam was a business student, the sketch overall seems less probable for that field compared to some others. Hence my rough estimate of a 30% probability.
