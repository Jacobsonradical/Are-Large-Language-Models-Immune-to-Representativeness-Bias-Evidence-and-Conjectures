Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong curiosity about nature, empathy, and an appreciation for hard work. While these qualities could apply to some business administration students, the sketch overall seems to fit less well with typical traits and interests of graduate students in that field, such as leadership drive, competitiveness, extroversion, and interest in finance, management, and entrepreneurship. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration grad student.
