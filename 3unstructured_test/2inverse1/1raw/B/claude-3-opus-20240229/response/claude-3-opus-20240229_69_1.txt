Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to some graduate students in business administration, they seem more typical of students in fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or philosophy. Business administration students often have more of an interest in leadership, management, finance, and entrepreneurship. So while it's certainly possible Adam was a business student, the probability seems rather low based on the personality sketch, perhaps around 0.2.
