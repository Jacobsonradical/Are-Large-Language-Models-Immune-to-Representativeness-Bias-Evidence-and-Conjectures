Here is my estimate, based on the personality sketch and the information provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who has a curiosity about nature, enjoys puzzles and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy and love for animals. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have these traits, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps psychology. Business administration tends to be more focused on management, finance, marketing and other business-related topics. So while it's plausible Adam was studying business administration, I wouldn't consider it the most likely field given his described personality and interests. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability (0.3) that the personality sketch is of a business administration graduate student.
