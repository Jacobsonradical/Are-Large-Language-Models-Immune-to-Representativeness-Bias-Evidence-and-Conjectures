Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and abstract thinking, seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps mathematics or philosophy. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits and interests, they seem less directly relevant to typical business administration studies. However, strong empathy and dedication are qualities that could serve someone well in business leadership roles. Given the mix of traits, some of which seem less common for business and some of which could be assets, I estimate a moderate 30% probability that the sketch is describing Adam as a business administration graduate student.
