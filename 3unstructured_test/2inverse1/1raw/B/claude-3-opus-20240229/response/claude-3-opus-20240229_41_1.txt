Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work, are not strongly associated with typical graduate studies in business administration. However, since the sketch indicates high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which could be relevant to business studies, I assign a probability of 0.3 rather than a lower value. The personality profile seems more likely to fit someone in a field involving nature, life sciences, or perhaps psychology or philosophy.
