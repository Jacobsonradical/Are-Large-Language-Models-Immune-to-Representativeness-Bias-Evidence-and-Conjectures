Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and aptitude for abstract thinking, seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or philosophy. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they don't seem to be the most common or stereotypical characteristics associated with that field of study. So I estimate a relatively low 30% probability that the sketch is describing a business administration graduate student.
