Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, do not seem to strongly align with typical characteristics of graduate students in business administration. However, qualities like intelligence, understanding of hard work, and puzzle-solving ability could be relevant in that field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that this sketch would describe Adam if he were a business administration graduate student.
