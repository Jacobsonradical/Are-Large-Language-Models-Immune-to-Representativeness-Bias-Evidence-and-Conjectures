Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and understanding abstract concepts, do not seem to strongly align with typical traits or interests of graduate students in business administration. However, the sketch does mention intelligence, hard work and dedication, which could apply to many graduate students regardless of field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that this sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration grad student, but I wouldn't rule it out entirely based on the information provided.
