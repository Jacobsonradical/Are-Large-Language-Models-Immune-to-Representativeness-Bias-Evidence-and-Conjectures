Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the specified field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, do not seem to strongly align with a typical profile of a business administration student. However, qualities like intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and puzzle-solving skills could be relevant in this field to some extent. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that the sketch is describing Adam if he was enrolled in business administration.
