Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and abstract concepts. While it's certainly possible for a business administration graduate student to have those traits, they seem to align more closely with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, psychology, or philosophy. Business administration tends to attract those with more of an interest in leadership, management, finance, and organizational operations. So while it's plausible Adam was studying business, I'd estimate only a modest 30% probability given the details in the personality sketch.
