Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who loves nature, animals, puzzles, and has strong empathy. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem more stereotypically associated with other fields like biology, veterinary medicine, psychology, etc. The abstract thinking could fit with business administration to some degree. Overall, while it's plausible Adam with this personality could be a business student, I don't think this profile provides strong evidence of that, so I estimate a relatively low 30% probability. Of course, individuals can have diverse interests and traits that don't always align with field stereotypes.
