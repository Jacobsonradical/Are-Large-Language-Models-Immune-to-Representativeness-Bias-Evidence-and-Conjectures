Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who has a deep curiosity about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to some graduate students in business administration, they seem more strongly aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, psychology, or even certain humanities. Business administration students often have skills and interests more focused on management, finance, strategy, and entrepreneurship. So while it's certainly possible Adam was a business student, the probability seems relatively low based on the personality description provided.
