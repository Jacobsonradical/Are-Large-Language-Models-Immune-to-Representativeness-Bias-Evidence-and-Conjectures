Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and is good at abstract thinking. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem more typical of someone in a field related to life sciences, psychology, philosophy, or perhaps certain humanities. So I estimate a 30% chance that the personality sketch is of a business administration graduate student, based on the information provided.
