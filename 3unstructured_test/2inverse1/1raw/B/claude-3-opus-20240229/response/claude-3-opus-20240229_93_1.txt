Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, do not seem to align particularly strongly with a graduate student in business administration. However, traits like intelligence, understanding of hard work, and problem-solving skills could be relevant in that field. So while it's certainly possible, I don't consider it highly probable based solely on the given personality sketch.
