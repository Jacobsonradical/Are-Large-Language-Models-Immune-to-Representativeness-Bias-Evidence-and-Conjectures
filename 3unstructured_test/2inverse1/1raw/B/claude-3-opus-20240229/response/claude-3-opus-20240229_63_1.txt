Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and Adam's graduate student status in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or philosophy. Business administration is certainly a possibility, but based solely on the provided sketch, it seems less probable than some other fields of study. Of course, there are many other factors that influence a person's choice of graduate program beyond just personality. My 0.2 estimate reflects that it's plausible but I judge other fields to be more likely matches given the limited information provided.
