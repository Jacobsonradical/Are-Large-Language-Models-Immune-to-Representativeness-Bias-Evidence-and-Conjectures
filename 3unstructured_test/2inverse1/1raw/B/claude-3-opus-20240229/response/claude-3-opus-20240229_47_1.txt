Here is my estimate, based on the personality sketch and Adam being a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, environmental science, or possibly certain areas of psychology or mathematics. Business administration is certainly a possibility, but the described traits and interests don't seem to strongly point to that specific field compared to some others. Therefore, I estimate a probability of around 0.3 that the personality sketch is describing a graduate student in business administration.
