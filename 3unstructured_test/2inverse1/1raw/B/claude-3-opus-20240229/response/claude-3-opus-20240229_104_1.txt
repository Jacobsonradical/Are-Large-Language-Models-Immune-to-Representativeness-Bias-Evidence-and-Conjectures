Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to some business administration students, they seem more typical of students in fields like biology, psychology, or philosophy. Business administration programs tend to focus more on practical skills related to management, finance, and operations. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student.
