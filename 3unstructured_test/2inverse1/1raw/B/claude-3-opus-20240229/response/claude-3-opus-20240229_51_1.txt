Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and Adam's enrollment as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, do not seem to strongly align with a typical profile for someone studying business administration. However, some elements like understanding hard work and dedication could be relevant. Overall, I estimate a relatively low probability of around 0.2 that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student, based on the information provided.
