Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, could certainly apply to some students in business administration. However, they seem more stereotypically associated with fields like biology, veterinary medicine, psychology, or certain sciences and humanities. Business administration students on average may be relatively more interested in topics related to management, finance, marketing and entrepreneurship. So while it's certainly possible the sketch is describing Adam as a business student, I'd put the probability a bit lower than for some other fields. That said, individual students in any discipline can have a very wide range of interests and characteristics.
