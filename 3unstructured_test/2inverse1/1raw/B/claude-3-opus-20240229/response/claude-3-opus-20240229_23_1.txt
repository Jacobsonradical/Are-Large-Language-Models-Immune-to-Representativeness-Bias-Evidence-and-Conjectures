Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy and a love for animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, they seem more typical of someone in a field related to the natural sciences, psychology, or veterinary medicine. Business administration does not seem like the most likely fit given the emphasis on curiosity about plants and animals and abstract thinking. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that the personality sketch is describing Adam if he was a graduate student in business administration.
