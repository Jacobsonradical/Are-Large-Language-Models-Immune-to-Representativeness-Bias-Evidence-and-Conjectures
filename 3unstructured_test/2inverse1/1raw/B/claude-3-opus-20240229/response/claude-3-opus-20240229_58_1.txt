Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and abstract thinking, seem more aligned with fields like biology, veterinary medicine, psychology, or mathematics rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to also pursue graduate studies in business, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. That's why I estimate a 30% probability.
