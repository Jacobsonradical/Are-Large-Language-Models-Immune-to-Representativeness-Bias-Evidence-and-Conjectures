Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, the strong emphasis on curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and abstract thinking suggest fields more oriented towards the natural sciences. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying business administration, I would put the probability a bit lower, around 0.3.
