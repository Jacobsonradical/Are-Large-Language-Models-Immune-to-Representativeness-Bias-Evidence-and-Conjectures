Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or veterinary medicine. Business administration students often have skills in leadership, communication, analytics, and strategic thinking. So while it's certainly possible Adam was a business administration grad student, the probability seems lower than for some other fields based on the personality description provided.
