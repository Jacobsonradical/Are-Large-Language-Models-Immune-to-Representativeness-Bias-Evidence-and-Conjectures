Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While some of these traits could apply to a graduate student in business administration, the strong emphasis on curiosity about plants and animals and solving puzzles seems less typical of that field. Business administration students often have traits like being ambitious, analytical, leadership-oriented, and interested in finance, management, and organizations. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that the personality sketch is describing Adam if he was a graduate student in business administration.
