Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and understanding abstract concepts, are not strongly associated with typical traits of business administration students. However, intelligence, hard work and dedication are relevant traits. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that this sketch would describe a graduate student in business administration.
