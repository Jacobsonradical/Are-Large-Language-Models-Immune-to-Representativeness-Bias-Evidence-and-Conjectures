Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, while admirable qualities, do not seem to strongly align with the typical profile of a graduate student in business administration. However, since no field is completely homogenous, there is still some possibility that Adam possesses these traits while being enrolled in a business administration program.
