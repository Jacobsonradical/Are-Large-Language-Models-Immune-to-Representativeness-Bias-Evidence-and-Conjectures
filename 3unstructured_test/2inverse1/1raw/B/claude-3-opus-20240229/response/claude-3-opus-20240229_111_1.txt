Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, others seem less directly relevant. Interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts are not typically central to business administration. So while it's certainly possible Adam had those interests, I'd estimate only a 30% probability that this personality sketch is describing a graduate student in that particular field.
