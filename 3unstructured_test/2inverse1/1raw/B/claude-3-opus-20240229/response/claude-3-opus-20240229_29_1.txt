Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to someone in any field, they seem less typical of graduate students in business administration compared to some other fields. Business administration students often focus more on management, finance, and organizational behavior. The curiosity about plants and animals and puzzle-solving seem less directly relevant. However, the intelligence, hard work and abstract thinking abilities certainly could align with business administration. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying business, I estimate only a 20% chance based on the personality sketch. The traits feel more typical of students in fields like biology, psychology, or certain humanities.
