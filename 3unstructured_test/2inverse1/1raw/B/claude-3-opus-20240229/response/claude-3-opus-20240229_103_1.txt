Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, loves animals, is empathetic, and has an aptitude for abstract concepts. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem to align more with fields like biology, veterinary medicine, psychology, or maybe certain areas of research. Business administration students often tend to be more interested in topics like management, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship. So while it's possible the sketch is describing a business student, I'd put the probability as relatively low, around 0.2.
