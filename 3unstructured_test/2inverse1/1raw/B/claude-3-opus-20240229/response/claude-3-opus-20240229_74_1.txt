Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, do not seem to strongly align with typical characteristics of graduate students in business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits to pursue an advanced degree in business. My probability estimate of 0.3 reflects that while it seems less likely, it's not implausible based on the limited information provided.
