Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who loves nature, animals, and abstract thinking, which seems less typical of a business administration student. However, the traits of intelligence, understanding hard work, and problem solving ability could align with this field to some degree. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low but non-zero probability of 0.2 that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student.
