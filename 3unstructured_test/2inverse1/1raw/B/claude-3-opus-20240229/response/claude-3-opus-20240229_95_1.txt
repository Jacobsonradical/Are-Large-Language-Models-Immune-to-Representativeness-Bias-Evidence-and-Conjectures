Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, loves animals, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic, and understands abstract concepts well. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem to align more closely with fields like biology, veterinary medicine, psychology, or mathematics. Business administration students often tend to be more practically-minded and people-oriented. So while it's plausible Adam was studying business, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 based solely on the limited information provided in the personality sketch.
