Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps mathematics rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to pursue graduate studies in business. The sketch doesn't rule it out, but I don't think it strongly suggests business administration as the most likely field based on the information provided.
