Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, while positive attributes, do not strike me as highly correlated with someone pursuing graduate studies in business administration. Some of the traits like abstract thinking ability could apply, but overall the description seems more aligned with other potential fields of study. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that this sketch would describe a typical business administration graduate student.
