Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and is good at abstract thinking. While it's certainly possible for a business administration graduate student to have those traits, they seem to align more with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or philosophy that involve pondering abstract ideas. So I estimate a relatively low probability of around 0.3 that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration grad student.
