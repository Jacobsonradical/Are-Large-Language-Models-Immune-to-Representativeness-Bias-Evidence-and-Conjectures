Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, loves animals, has strong empathy, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, the curiosity about nature and plants, as well as the deep love for animals, seem less typical for that field of study. Business administration tends to attract students more interested in leadership, management, entrepreneurship, and organizational operations. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying business administration, the details in the personality sketch suggest a lower probability compared to some other potential fields. My rough estimate is a 20% chance he was enrolled in business administration.
