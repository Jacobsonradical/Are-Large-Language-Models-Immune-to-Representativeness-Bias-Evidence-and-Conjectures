Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, the strong focus on nature, animals, and abstract thinking suggests the person may be more likely to study a field in the natural sciences, such as biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology or another social science. Business administration is certainly a possibility but based on the sketch, I estimate a lower probability of around 0.3 that this particular individual was a business administration graduate student.
