Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, the strong emphasis on curiosity about plants and animals, as well as abstract thinking, makes me think this person is more likely studying a field in the natural sciences, such as biology, ecology, or zoology. Business administration is certainly a possibility, but based on the description provided, I estimate only a 20% chance that Adam was a graduate student in business administration.
