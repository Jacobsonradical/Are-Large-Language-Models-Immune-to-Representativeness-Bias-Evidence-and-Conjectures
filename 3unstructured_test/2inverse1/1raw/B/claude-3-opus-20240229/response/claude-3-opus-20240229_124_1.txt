Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or philosophy rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to also pursue graduate studies in business, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. That's why I estimated a relatively low but non-zero probability of 0.2.
