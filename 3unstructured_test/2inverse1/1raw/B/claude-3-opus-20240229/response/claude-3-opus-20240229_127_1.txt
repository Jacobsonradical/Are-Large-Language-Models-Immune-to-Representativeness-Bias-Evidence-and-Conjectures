Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and understanding of abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to some business administration students, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps certain humanities. Business administration students often have skills in leadership, management, finance, and entrepreneurship. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying business, the mentioned traits seem less probable for that field compared to some others. Hence, I estimate a 30% probability based on the given information.
