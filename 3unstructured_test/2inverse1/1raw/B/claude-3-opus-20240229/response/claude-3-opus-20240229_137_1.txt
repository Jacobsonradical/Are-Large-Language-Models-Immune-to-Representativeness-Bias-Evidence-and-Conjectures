Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, veterinary medicine, or mathematics rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to also pursue graduate studies in business. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that the sketch is describing Adam as a business administration student.
