Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, could apply to some students in business administration. However, they seem more typical of students in fields like biology, veterinary science, psychology, or other sciences. Business administration students often have more interest in finance, management, marketing and related topics. So while it's certainly possible Adam with this personality was a business student, I'd estimate only a 30% probability based on the sketch provided.
