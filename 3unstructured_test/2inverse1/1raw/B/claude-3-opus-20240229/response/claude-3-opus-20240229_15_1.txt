Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy and loves animals, and appreciates abstract concepts and hard work. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem to align more closely with fields like biology, veterinary medicine, psychology, or perhaps certain areas of research. Business administration students often tend to be more interested in topics like management, finance, marketing and entrepreneurship. So while not impossible, I estimate only a 20% chance that the sketch is describing a graduate student in business administration specifically.
