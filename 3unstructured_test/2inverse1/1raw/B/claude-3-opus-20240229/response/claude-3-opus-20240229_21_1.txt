Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming Adam was a graduate student in business administration in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, loves animals, has strong empathy, and enjoys solving puzzles. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem less directly aligned with typical characteristics and interests of graduate students in that field. The mention of understanding abstract concepts and having high intelligence could fit with many graduate-level fields. Overall, without more specifics, I estimate only a 20% chance the sketch is describing Adam as a business administration grad student, based on the details provided.
