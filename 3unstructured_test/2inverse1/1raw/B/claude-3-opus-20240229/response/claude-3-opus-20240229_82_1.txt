Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and has strong abstract thinking abilities. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem to align more with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or philosophy. Business administration programs tend to focus more on topics like finance, accounting, marketing, and management. So while it's plausible Adam was studying business, I wouldn't say it's the most likely field given his described personality and interests.
