Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and abstract thinking, do not seem to align strongly with the typical profile of a business administration student. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to pursue graduate studies in business, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. My rough estimate is that there is a 20% chance the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student.
