Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who seems to have a strong interest in and aptitude for science and abstract thinking. While it's certainly possible for someone with those traits to pursue business administration, I think fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or mathematics might be a more natural fit based on the description. So I estimate a 30% probability that the individual described was studying business administration specifically.
