Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and abstract thinking, don't strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to pursue business, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. My rough estimate is that there is a 30% chance the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student.
