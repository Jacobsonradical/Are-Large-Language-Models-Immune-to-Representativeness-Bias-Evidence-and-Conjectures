Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and abstract thinking, do not seem to align strongly with typical traits and interests of graduate students in business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits to pursue an advanced business degree, so I did not assign a very low probability. The sketch provides limited information to determine the likelihood confidently.
