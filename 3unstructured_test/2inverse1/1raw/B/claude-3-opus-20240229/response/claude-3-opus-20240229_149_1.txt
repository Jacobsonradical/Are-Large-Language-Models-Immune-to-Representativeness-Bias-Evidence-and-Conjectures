Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, do not seem to strongly align with typical traits of business administration students. However, intelligence and appreciation of hard work and dedication could apply to many graduate students regardless of field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that this sketch describes Adam if he was a business administration graduate student.
