Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, do not seem to align strongly with the typical profile of a business administration student. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to pursue graduate studies in business. The sketch does mention an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could be relevant. Overall though, based on the limited information provided, I estimate a relatively low probability of about 0.3 that this sketch describes Adam if he was a business administration grad student.
