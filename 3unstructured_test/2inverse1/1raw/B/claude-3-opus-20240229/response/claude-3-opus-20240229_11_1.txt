Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and is good at abstract thinking. While these traits could apply to some business administration students, they seem more typical of students in fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or psychology. Business administration tends to attract people who are more interested in finance, management, entrepreneurship, and leadership. So while it's certainly possible Adam was a business student, I don't think this personality profile provides strong evidence of that. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 30% probability that Adam was studying business administration based solely on the given personality sketch.
