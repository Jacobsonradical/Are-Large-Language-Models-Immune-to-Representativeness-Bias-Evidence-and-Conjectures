Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, are not typically as strongly associated with graduate studies in business administration compared to some other fields. However, they are not entirely incompatible either, as business requires analytical thinking and dedication. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.3 that the sketch is describing Adam as a business administration graduate student.
