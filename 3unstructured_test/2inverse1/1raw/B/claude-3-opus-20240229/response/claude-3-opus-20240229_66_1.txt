Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who has a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those interests, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps mathematics or philosophy. So while I wouldn't rule out the possibility entirely, I'd estimate only around a 20% chance that the personality sketch is describing a business administration graduate student based on the information provided.
