Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who has a curiosity about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy and love for animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, they seem more typical of someone in a field related to natural sciences, psychology, or veterinary medicine. Business administration students often have skills in leadership, communication, analytics and tend to be more extroverted. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying business, the described personality traits seem less probable for that particular field of study.
