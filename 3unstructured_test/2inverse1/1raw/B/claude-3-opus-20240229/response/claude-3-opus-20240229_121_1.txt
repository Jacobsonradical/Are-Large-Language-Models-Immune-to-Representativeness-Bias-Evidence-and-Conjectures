Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if Adam was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

While some aspects of the personality sketch could fit a business administration student, such as high intelligence and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, other traits seem less typical, such as the strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. Business administration students often have more applied, practical, and people-oriented interests. So while it's certainly possible, I don't think it's a strong match overall based on the limited information provided.
