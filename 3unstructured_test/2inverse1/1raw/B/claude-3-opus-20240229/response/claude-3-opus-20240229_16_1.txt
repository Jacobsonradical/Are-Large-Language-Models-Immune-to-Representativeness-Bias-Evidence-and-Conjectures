Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work, could certainly apply to some people studying business administration. However, they seem more stereotypically associated with fields like biology, veterinary medicine, psychology, or certain humanities. Business administration students on average may be relatively more interested in topics like economics, finance, management and less focused on nature, animals and abstract concepts compared to some other fields. So while it's quite possible the sketch is of a business student, I'd estimate the probability as only around 30% based on the limited information provided.
