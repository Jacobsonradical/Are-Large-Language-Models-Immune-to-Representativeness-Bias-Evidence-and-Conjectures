Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, the strong emphasis on curiosity about plants and animals, as well as puzzle-solving, suggests fields more directly related to natural sciences. So while it's possible Adam was studying business administration, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 based on the given personality sketch.
