Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy and a love for animals, and understands abstract concepts well. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem to align more closely with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or even mathematics or philosophy. Business administration students often have skills and interests more focused on management, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship. So while it's plausible Adam could be a business student, I estimate a lower probability of around 0.3 based on the personality description provided.
