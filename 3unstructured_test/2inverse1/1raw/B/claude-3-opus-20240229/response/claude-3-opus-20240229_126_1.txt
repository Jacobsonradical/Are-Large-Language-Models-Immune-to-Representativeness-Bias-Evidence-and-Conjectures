Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the specified field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and an abstract thinking style, do not seem to strongly align with a typical profile of a business administration student. However, qualities like intelligence, understanding of hard work, and problem-solving ability could be relevant in any field, including business. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student.
