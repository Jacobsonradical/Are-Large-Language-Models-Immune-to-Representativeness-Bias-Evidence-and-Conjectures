Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, do not seem to strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to pursue graduate studies in business. Without more specific information linking the description to business, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that it refers to Adam as a business administration graduate student.
