Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps mathematics or philosophy. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those interests and traits, they seem less typical for that field of study. Business administration students often tend to be more outgoing, competitive, and focused on practical applications rather than abstract concepts. So while not impossible, I estimate only a 20% chance the sketch is describing a business administration graduate student.
