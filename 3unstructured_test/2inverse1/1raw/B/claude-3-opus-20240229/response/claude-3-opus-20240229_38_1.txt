Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who loves nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem to align more with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or perhaps mathematics. Business administration students often tend to be more interested in leadership, management, finance, and organizational behavior. So while it's plausible Adam was studying business, the limited information provided suggests a lower probability of around 0.2 in my estimation.
