Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, are not strongly associated with typical business administration students. While it's certainly possible for a business student to have those traits, I would expect a relatively low probability based on the sketch provided.
