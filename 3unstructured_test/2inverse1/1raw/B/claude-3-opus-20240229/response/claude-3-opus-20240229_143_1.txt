Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, if he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, do not seem to align strongly with a typical business administration student profile. However, qualities like intelligence, understanding of hard work, and puzzle-solving skills could be relevant in that field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low but non-zero probability of 0.3 that this sketch would describe a graduate student in business administration.
