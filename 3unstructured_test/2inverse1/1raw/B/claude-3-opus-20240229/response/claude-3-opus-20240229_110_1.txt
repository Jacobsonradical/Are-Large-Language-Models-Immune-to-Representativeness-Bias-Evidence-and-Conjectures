Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, do not seem to strongly align with typical traits of business administration students. However, qualities like intelligence, understanding of hard work, and problem-solving skills could be relevant for success in business school. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low but non-zero probability of 0.3 that this sketch would describe Adam if he were a business administration graduate student.
