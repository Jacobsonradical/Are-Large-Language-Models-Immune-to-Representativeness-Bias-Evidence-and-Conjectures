Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the specified format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy and love for animals. While these traits could apply to some business administration students, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or philosophy. Business administration tends to attract people who are more interested in leadership, management, finance, and organizational operations. So while it's certainly possible Adam was a business administration graduate student, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 based solely on the given personality sketch.
