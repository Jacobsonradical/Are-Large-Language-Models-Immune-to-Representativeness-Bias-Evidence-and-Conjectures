Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and understanding abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to some business administration students, they seem to align more closely with fields like biology, zoology, psychology, or mathematics. Business administration students often have skills in leadership, communication, analytics, and strategic thinking. So while it's certainly possible Adam was a business administration graduate student, the probability seems somewhat low based on the given personality sketch.
