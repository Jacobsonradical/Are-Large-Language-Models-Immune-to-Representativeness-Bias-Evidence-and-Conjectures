Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

While the personality sketch indicates traits like intelligence, curiosity, and empathy which could be found in many fields, it specifically mentions an interest in nature and plants, as well as an ability to understand abstract concepts. This seems more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology rather than a more applied field like business administration. However, the traits mentioned are quite broad and could apply to a variety of fields, so I would not completely rule out business administration.
