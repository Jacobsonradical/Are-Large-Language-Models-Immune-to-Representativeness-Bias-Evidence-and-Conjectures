Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, given he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps mathematics. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem less typical for that field compared to the alternatives. However, strong empathy and dedication are qualities that could serve well in business leadership roles. Given the mix of traits, I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch describes a business administration graduate student.
