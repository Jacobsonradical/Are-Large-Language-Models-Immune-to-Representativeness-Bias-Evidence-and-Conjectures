Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, do not seem strongly aligned with typical traits and interests of graduate students in business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits to pursue that field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that the sketch is about Adam if he was a business administration grad student.
