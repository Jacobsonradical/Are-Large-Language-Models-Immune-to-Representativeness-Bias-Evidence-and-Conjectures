Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these qualities could apply to someone in any field, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or environmental science rather than business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to pursue an MBA or business-related graduate degree. So while I don't think it's the most likely field given the sketch, I wouldn't rule it out entirely. Hence my rough probability estimate of 0.3.
