Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the information that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and is good at abstract thinking. While these traits could apply to some students in any field, including business administration, they seem more aligned with other fields such as biology, psychology, philosophy, or veterinary medicine. Business administration students often have traits like being ambitious, competitive, extroverted, and interested in finance, management and entrepreneurship. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying business administration, the probability seems relatively low based on the personality sketch provided. My rough estimate is 20% or 0.2 probability.
