Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits and interests, they are not typically as strongly associated with that field of study compared to some others like biology, zoology, mathematics, or philosophy. Business administration tends to be a more applied, practical field. So while it's plausible the sketch could describe a business student, I don't think it's highly probable based on the information provided. Hence my rough estimate of a 30% probability.
