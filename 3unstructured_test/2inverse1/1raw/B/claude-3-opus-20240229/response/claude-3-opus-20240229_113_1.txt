Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and is good at abstract thinking. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem more typical of someone in a field like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps certain humanities or social science fields. Business administration tends to attract people who are more interested in organizations, management, finance, and pragmatic problem-solving. So while it's plausible the sketch could describe a business student, I don't think it's the most likely field given the details provided. Therefore, I estimate a 30% chance the sketch is of Adam if he was a business administration grad student.
