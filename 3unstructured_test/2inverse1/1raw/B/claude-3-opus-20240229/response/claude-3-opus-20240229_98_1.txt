Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, could certainly apply to some students in business administration. However, other details like enjoying puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts seem less directly related to typical business administration studies. Therefore, while it's plausible the sketch could be of a business student, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 given the overall profile presented.
