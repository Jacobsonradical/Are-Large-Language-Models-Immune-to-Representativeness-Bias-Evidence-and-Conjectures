Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of abstract concepts, do not seem to align strongly with a typical graduate student in business administration. However, it's certainly possible for someone with those traits and interests to pursue that field of study. My estimated probability of 0.2 reflects that it seems less likely but still plausible that the sketch is describing Adam as a business administration student.
