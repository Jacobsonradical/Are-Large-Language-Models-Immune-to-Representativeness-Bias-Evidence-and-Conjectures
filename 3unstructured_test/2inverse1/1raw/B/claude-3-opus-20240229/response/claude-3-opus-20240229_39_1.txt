Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a deep curiosity about nature, empathy, love of animals, and an abstract and conceptual way of thinking. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem to align more with fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, or perhaps certain humanities. So I estimate a relatively low 20% probability that the sketch is describing a graduate student in business administration specifically.
