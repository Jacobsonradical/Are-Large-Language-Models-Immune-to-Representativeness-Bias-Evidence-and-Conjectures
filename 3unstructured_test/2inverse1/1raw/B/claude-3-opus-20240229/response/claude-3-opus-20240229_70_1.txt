Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch portrays someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, as well as qualities like empathy and appreciating hard work. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, the overall profile seems more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, philosophy, or veterinary medicine. Business administration students often have skills in leadership, communication, analysis and tend to be more extroverted. So while it's certainly possible Adam had these interests while studying business, I estimate a relatively low 30% probability that the sketch is describing a typical graduate student in that particular field.
