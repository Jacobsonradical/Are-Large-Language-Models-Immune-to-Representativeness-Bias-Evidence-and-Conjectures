Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, the strong focus on curiosity about plants and nature, love for animals, and abstract thinking abilities seem less typical of a business student and more suggestive of a science-related field. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch describes Adam if he was a graduate student in business administration.
