Here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, the mention of curiosity about plants and nature, as well as a deep love for animals, makes me think this person is less likely to be studying business administration. Business administration students stereotypically tend to be more interested in finance, management, economics, etc. The probability is non-zero since these traits don't rule out business administration entirely, but I would estimate only around a 30% chance based on the details provided.
