Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and an aptitude for abstract concepts. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem more stereotypically associated with fields like biology, veterinary medicine, psychology, or mathematics. Business administration students often have skills in leadership, communication, analytics and practical problem-solving. So while it's plausible the sketch could describe a business student, I don't think it's the most likely fit based on the limited information provided.
