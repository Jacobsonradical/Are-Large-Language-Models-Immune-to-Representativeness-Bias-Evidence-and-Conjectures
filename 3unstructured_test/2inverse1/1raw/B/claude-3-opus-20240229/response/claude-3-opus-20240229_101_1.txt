Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and the specified format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or perhaps philosophy. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they don't seem to be the most typical characteristics associated with that field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student.
