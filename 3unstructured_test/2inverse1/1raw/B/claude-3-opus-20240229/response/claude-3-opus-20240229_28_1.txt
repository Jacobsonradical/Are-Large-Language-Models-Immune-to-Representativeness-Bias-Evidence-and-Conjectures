Here is my estimate, based on the given personality sketch and field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts, do not seem to strongly align with typical characteristics associated with business administration. However, the sketch does mention an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could be relevant in a business setting. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that the personality sketch is describing Adam if he was enrolled in a business administration graduate program.
