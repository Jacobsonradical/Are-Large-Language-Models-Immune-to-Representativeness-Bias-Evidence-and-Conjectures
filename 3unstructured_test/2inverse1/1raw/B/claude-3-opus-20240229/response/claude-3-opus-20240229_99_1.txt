Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy and loves animals, and appreciates hard work. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, they seem more indicative of someone in a field related to natural sciences, psychology, or veterinary medicine. So I estimate a relatively low 30% probability that the personality sketch is describing Adam if he was a graduate student in business administration.
