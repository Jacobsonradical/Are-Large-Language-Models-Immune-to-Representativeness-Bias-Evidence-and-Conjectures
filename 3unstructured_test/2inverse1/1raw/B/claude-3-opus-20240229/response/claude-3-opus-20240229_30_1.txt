Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work, do not seem to strongly align with typical traits and interests of business administration students. However, the description of high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could fit with some business students. Overall, based on the limited information provided, I estimate only a 20% probability that this personality sketch describes Adam if he was a graduate student in business administration.
