Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, others seem less typical, especially the focus on nature, animals, and abstract concepts. Business administration tends to be a more people- and organization-focused field. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying business administration, I don't think the personality sketch provides strong evidence of that. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that Adam was enrolled in business administration based solely on the given personality description.
