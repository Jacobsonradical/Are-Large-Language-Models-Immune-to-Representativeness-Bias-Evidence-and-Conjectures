Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or perhaps certain areas of computer science or mathematics. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem less directly relevant to typical business administration curricula. However, strong work ethic and dedication are quite relevant to business. So I estimate a 30% probability that the sketch is describing a business administration graduate student.
