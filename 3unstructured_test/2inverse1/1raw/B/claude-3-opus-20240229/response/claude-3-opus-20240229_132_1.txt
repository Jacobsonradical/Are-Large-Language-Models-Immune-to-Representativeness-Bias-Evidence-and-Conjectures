Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

While it's certainly possible for someone with the traits described in the personality sketch to pursue graduate studies in business administration, the strong focus on curiosity about nature, love of animals, and understanding of abstract concepts seems more closely aligned with fields like biology, zoology, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or philosophy. Business administration students often have skills in leadership, strategic thinking, and financial analysis. So while not impossible, I estimate a relatively low probability of about 30% that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student.
