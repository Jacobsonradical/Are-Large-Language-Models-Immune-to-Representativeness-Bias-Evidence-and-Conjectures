Here is my estimate, based on the personality sketch provided and the assumption that Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, could potentially align with a variety of fields. Business administration is certainly a possibility, but the description doesn't provide strong evidence to suggest it's a likely match compared to other potential fields. So I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2 that the sketch is describing a business administration graduate student.
