Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in business administration in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work, could apply to some students in business administration. However, other mentioned traits like enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts seem less typical of business administration students compared to some other fields. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 that this sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student.
