Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and is good at abstract thinking. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary science, or perhaps certain humanities. So I estimate a relatively low 30% probability that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business administration graduate student. The traits don't seem like a very strong match for that particular field of study.
