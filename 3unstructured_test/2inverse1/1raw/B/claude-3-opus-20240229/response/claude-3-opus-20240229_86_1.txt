Here is my estimate, in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic and loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While it's certainly possible for a graduate student in business administration to have those traits, they seem to align more closely with fields like biology, veterinary medicine, psychology, or perhaps certain branches of mathematics or engineering. So I estimate a relatively low probability of about 0.3 that the sketch is describing a graduate student in business administration specifically.
