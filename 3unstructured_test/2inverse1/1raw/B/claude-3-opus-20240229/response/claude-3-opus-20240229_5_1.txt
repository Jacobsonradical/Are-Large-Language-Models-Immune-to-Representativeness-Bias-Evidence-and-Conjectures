Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys abstract thinking, and has strong empathy. While these traits could be found in someone studying business administration, they seem to align more closely with fields like biology, psychology, or veterinary science. Business administration tends to attract people who are more interested in organizations, leadership, and practical problem-solving. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying business, I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.3 given the details in the personality sketch.
