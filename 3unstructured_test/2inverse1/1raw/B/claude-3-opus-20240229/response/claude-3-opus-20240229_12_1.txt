Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, is empathetic, loves animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, the overall profile seems more aligned with fields related to natural sciences, veterinary medicine, or perhaps certain humanities or social science disciplines. Business administration is certainly a possibility but the sketch is not a quintessential description of a typical MBA student, so I estimate a relatively low probability of 0.2.
