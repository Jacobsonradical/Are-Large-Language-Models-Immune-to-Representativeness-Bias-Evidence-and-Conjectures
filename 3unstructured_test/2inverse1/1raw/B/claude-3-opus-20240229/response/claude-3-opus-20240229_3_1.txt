Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who loves nature, animals, and abstract concepts, which seems less typical of a business administration student. However, the traits of intelligence, hard work, and dedication could apply to many graduate students regardless of field. So while business administration seems less likely than some other fields given the personality description, I wouldn't rule it out entirely.
