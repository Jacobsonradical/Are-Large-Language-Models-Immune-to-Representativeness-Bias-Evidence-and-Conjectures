Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, loves animals, and is good at abstract thinking. While these traits could apply to some business administration students, they seem to align more closely with fields like biology, zoology, veterinary science, or perhaps certain humanities fields. Business administration tends to attract people who are more interested in management, finance, and practical organizational matters. So while it's certainly possible Adam was a business student, I'd put the probability around 0.3 based on the given personality description.
