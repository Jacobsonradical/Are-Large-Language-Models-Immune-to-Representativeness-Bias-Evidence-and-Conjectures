Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given that he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has strong empathy and loves animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While some of these traits could apply to a business administration student, they seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, veterinary medicine, or even certain humanities. Business administration students often have interests in leadership, finance, management, entrepreneurship, etc. which are not mentioned. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying business, the sketch overall seems less probable for that field compared to some others. Thus, I estimate a 30% probability.
