Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam if he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and understanding abstract concepts, do not seem to strongly align with typical characteristics of business administration students. However, qualities like intelligence, understanding of hard work, and problem-solving skills could be relevant in that field. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low but non-zero probability of 0.3 that the sketch is describing Adam as a business administration grad student.
