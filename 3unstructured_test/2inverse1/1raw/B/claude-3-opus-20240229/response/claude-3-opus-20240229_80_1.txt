Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work, could apply to some students in business administration. However, other traits like enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are less typical for that field of study. Business administration students often tend to be more pragmatic, social, and focused on concrete real-world applications. So while it's certainly possible the sketch could describe Adam if he studied business, I don't think the overall profile is a very close match for the average student in that field. Therefore, I estimate only a 30% probability that the sketch is about Adam assuming he was a business administration graduate student.
