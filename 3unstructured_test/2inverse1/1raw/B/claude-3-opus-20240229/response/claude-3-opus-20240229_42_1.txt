Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, veterinary science, or perhaps certain areas of psychology or philosophy. Business administration is a more practical, organization and management-focused field. However, the sketch does mention an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could be relevant to business. So while business administration doesn't seem like the most probable field given the description, it's not entirely implausible. Therefore, I estimate a 30% probability.
