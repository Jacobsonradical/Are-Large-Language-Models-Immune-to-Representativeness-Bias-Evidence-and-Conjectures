Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, assuming he was a graduate student in business administration in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and aptitude for abstract concepts, seem more aligned with fields like biology, psychology, or perhaps certain areas of computer science or mathematics. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those qualities, they don't seem as strongly associated with typical motivations and strengths for pursuing graduate studies in business. So I estimate a relatively low 30% probability that the sketch is describing Adam if he was a business graduate student.
