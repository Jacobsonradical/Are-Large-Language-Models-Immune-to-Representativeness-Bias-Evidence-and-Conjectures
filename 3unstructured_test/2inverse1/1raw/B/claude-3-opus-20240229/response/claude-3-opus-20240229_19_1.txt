Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, abstract concepts, and hard work. While it's certainly possible for a business administration student to have those traits, they seem more typical of someone in a field like biology, zoology, veterinary medicine, or perhaps mathematics or philosophy. Business administration students often have skills in leadership, communication, and practical problem-solving. So while it's plausible Adam could be a business student, I estimate only a 20% probability based on the given personality sketch.
