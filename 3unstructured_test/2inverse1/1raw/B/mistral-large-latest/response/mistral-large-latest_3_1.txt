Explanation: The subject's interests and qualities seem more aligned with fields related to science, environmental studies, or psychology due to the mention of curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and aptitude for abstract concepts. While it's possible for someone with these traits to pursue business administration, it's not as likely as some other fields, hence the probability of 0.3.
