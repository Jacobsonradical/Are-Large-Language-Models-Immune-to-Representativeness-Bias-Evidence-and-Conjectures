Based on the personality sketch provided, here's the estimated probability that the sketch was about Adam, given that he was enrolled in business administration:

{
  "business administration": 0.3
}

The rationale behind this estimate is that while Adam's personality traits (curiosity, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work) could be beneficial in any field, the sketch does not highlight typical business-oriented traits such as leadership, extraversion, or a strong focus on management or finance. Instead, it emphasizes traits and interests (love for nature, plants, animals, and puzzles) that are more commonly associated with fields like science, environmental studies, or psychology. Therefore, the probability is estimated to be relatively low at 0.3.
