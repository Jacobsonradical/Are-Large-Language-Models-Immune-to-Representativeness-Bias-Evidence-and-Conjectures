  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation: While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to any field, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy are not typically aligned with the business administration field. Moreover, his preference for quiet puzzle-solving does not necessarily fit the often extroverted and fast-paced environment of business administration. Therefore, the probability is estimated to be relatively low at 0.2.
