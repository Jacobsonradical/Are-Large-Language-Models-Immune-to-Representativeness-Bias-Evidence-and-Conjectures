Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems more inclined towards natural sciences, environmental studies, or fields that involve problem-solving, abstract thinking, and empathy such as psychology or medicine. Business administration typically attracts individuals focused on management, finance, and organizational leadership, which might not align as closely with Adam's apparent interests and traits. Therefore, there is a lower probability that Adam, with his described personality, would be enrolled in business administration.
