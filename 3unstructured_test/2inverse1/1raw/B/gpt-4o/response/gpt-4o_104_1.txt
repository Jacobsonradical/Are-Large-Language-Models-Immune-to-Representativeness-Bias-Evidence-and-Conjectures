  "business administration": 0.2

The personality traits described, such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, a propensity for solving puzzles, and high intelligence with an appreciation for hard work, seem to align more closely with fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps even psychology. While it is certainly possible for someone with these traits to be in a business administration program, the probability seems lower because the traits described do not typically align with the common characteristics and interests of students pursuing business administration.
