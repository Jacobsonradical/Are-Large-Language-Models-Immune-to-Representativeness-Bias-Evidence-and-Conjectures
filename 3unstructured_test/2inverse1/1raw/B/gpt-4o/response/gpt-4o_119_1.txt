The personality sketch of Adam suggests that he has a strong interest in nature, solving puzzles, empathy, animal welfare, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These characteristics are not typically associated with a standard business administration program, which focuses more on leadership, management, economics, and organizational operations. While it's not impossible for someone with Adam's interests to pursue business administration, the likelihood appears lower compared to fields more aligned with his described traits, such as environmental science or psychology.
