  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation: While it's certainly possible for someone with Adam's described qualities to be enrolled in business administration, his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work might more commonly align with fields such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine. The quiet and empathetic nature also leans more towards sciences or research-oriented fields rather than the typically outgoing and competitive world of business administration. Therefore, the probability is relatively low but not impossible.
