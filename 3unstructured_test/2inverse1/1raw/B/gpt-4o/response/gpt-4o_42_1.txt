  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation: The personality sketch indicates a deep curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, and a strong interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. These traits suggest a leaning towards scientific or analytical fields rather than business administration. While it is certainly possible for someone with this personality to be enrolled in business administration, it seems less aligned with their primary interests and strengths. Therefore, the probability is lower but not negligible.
