  "business administration": 0.3
}

Reasoning: The personality sketch describes someone with strong empathy, a love for animals, and a genuine curiosity about nature. These traits are not commonly associated with a typical business administration student, who might be more focused on economic, managerial, and analytical skills. However, it is still possible for someone with the described traits to pursue business administration, hence the probability is not very high but not negligible either.
