  "business administration": 0.2
}

Given the personality sketch, traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, a warm heart, strong empathy, and an affinity for solving puzzles suggest a person more aligned with fields related to biology, environmental science, psychology, or other natural sciences rather than business administration. However, it is not impossible for someone with these traits to be in business administration, hence a moderate but low probability.
