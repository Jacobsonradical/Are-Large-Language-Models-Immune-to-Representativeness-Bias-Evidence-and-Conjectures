  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Adam's personality sketch suggests qualities and interests more aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology rather than business administration. While it is certainly possible for someone with Adam's characteristics to pursue a degree in business administration, the emphasis on curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and solving puzzles appears less directly related to typical business administration interests. These factors lead me to estimate a lower probability that the sketch pertains to a student enrolled in business administration.
