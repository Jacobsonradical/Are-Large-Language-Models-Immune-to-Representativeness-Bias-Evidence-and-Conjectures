  "business administration": 0.2
}

Given Adam's personality sketch, which highlights his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a business administration program, compared to other fields more closely related to his interests. However, it's not impossible, which is why I've assigned a probability of 0.2.
