  "business administration": 0.2
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam is someone with a strong curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has a deep love for animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication. These traits align more closely with fields related to sciences, particularly those that involve nature or animals, rather than business administration. Although it is still possible for someone with these traits to pursue business administration, the probability is relatively low. Therefore, a value of 0.2 reflects an understanding that while it is not impossible, it is not the most likely field for Adam.
