  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Considering the personality sketch, traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, strong empathy, love for animals, and enjoyment in solving puzzles suggest that Adam is more likely inclined towards fields related to science, nature, or psychology rather than business administration. While such traits do not entirely preclude the possibility of pursuing business administration, they are less aligned with the typical motivations for this field, hence the lower probability.
