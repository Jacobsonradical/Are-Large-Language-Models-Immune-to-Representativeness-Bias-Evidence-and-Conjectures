  "business administration": "0.2"

Explanation: Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong inclination towards nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract thinking. These characteristics are generally more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology rather than business administration, which often requires a different skill set. Therefore, the probability that this sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in business administration is relatively low.
