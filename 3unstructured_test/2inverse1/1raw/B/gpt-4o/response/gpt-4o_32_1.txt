Given Adam's interests and personality traits, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and affinity for solving puzzles and abstract concepts align more with fields in the natural sciences, environmental studies, or possibly a field like veterinary studies. Business administration typically focuses more on management, economics, finance, and organizational skills, which do not directly align with Adam's described preferences and strengths. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.
