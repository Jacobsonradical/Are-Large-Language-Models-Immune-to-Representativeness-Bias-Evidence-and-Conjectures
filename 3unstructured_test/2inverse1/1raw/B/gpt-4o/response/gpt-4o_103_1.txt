The probability is relatively low because the personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which align more closely with fields such as environmental science, biology, or perhaps even psychology. Business administration typically attracts individuals who are more focused on organizational strategies, finance, and management, and the traits described in the sketch do not strongly align with those interests.
