Given the personality traits described, such as a strong love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, as well as high intelligence and empathy, these characteristics seem less aligned with typical traits one might associate with a business administration student, such as a focus on commercial enterprises, management, and leadership. While it's certainly possible for someone with Adam's personality to be drawn to business administration, it seems less likely compared to other fields more directly connected to his interests and characteristics. Therefore, the probability estimate is relatively low.
