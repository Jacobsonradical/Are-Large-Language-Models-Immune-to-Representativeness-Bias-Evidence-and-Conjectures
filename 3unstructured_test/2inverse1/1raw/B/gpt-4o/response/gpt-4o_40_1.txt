  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation: Given Adam's profound interest in nature, plants, solving puzzles, high intelligence, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it is less likely he is enrolled in business administration, which traditionally attracts individuals more focused on commerce, finance, and organizational leadership, and typically less directly connected to the natural world and abstract problem-solving outside of business context. However, it is still possible, hence the probability is not zero, but on the lower side.
