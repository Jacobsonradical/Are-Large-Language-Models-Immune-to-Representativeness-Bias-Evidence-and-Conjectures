Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in the following fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field. Therefore, the probability is relatively high.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject is intelligent and appreciates hard work, the personality sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, strategic thinking, or interest in finance. Thus, the probability is lower.
