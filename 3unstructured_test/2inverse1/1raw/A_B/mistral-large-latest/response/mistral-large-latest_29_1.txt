Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with fields related to agricultural and veterinary science. This makes it highly probable that the sketch is about Adam if he were enrolled in this field.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be useful in business administration, the sketch's emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy suggests a lower probability that the sketch is about Adam if he were enrolled in this field.
