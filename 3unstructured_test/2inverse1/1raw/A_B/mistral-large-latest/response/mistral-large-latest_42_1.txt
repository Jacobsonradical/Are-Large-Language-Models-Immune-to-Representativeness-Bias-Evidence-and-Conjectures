Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with fields related to agriculture and veterinary science. Therefore, the probability is higher.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject is intelligent and understands abstract concepts, the personality traits described (such as a love for animals and nature) are less directly related to business administration. Therefore, the probability is lower.
