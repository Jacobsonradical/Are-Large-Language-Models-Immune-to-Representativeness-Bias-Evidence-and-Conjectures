Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary science.
- The mention of high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to both fields, but the specific interests mentioned lean more towards agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business administration is less likely given the specific interests in nature and animals, but it is not entirely ruled out, hence a lower probability.
