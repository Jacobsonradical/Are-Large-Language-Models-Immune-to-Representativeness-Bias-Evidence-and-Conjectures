Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary science.
- The mention of high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could apply to both fields, but the strong empathy and love for animals lean more towards agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business administration is less likely given the focus on nature and animals, but it is not entirely ruled out due to the mention of understanding hard work and dedication, which are valuable in any field.
