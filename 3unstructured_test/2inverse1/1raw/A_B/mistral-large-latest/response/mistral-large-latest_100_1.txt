Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in the following fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field. Additionally, their appreciation for hard work and dedication is a good fit for the demanding nature of agricultural and veterinary studies.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, their interests and personality traits seem less aligned with business administration. The focus on nature, animals, and empathy suggests a stronger fit with fields related to life sciences rather than business.
