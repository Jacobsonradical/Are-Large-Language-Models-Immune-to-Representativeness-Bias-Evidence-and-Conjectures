Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field. Therefore, the probability is relatively high.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject is intelligent and understands abstract concepts, the personality sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, strategic thinking, or financial acumen. Thus, the probability is lower.
