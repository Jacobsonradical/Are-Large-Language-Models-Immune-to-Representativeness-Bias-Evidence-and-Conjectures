```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field. Therefore, the probability is high.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject is intelligent and understands abstract concepts, the sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, strategic thinking, or entrepreneurial spirit. Thus, the probability is lower.
