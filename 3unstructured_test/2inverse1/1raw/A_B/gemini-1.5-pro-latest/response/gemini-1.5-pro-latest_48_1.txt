**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific pursuits. This aligns well with fields like agricultural science or veterinary medicine. Therefore, the probability is significantly higher for "agricultural and veterinary science."

While "business administration" isn't impossible, the sketch lacks indicators like an interest in finance, markets, or leadership - traits commonly associated with business students.  While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, they are not as uniquely suggestive as the other traits mentioned.
