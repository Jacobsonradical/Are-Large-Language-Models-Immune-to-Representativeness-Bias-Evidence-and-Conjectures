**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, empathy (animals), and potentially scientific thinking (curiosity about plants, solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts). This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a good fit. 

While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, the sketch lacks indicators of a strong interest in business concepts, leadership, or finance, making "business administration" less likely.
