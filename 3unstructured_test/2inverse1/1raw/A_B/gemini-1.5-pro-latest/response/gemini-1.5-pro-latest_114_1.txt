**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. These traits align more closely with **agricultural and veterinary science**. While someone in business administration can possess these traits, they are not as central to the field's focus. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic assessment based on limited information.  A person's interests and personality can lead them to a wide range of fields, and these probabilities are just estimates.
