Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch heavily emphasizes traits that align with these fields: love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, understanding of hard work (common in agriculture). This suggests a higher probability Adam is in this field.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant to business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, marketing, or management.  Empathy is valuable in business but less defining than the traits linked to agriculture/veterinary science. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information.  People are complex, and this sketch might not capture all of Adam's interests and aptitudes.
