Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The emphasis on nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work points towards a possible career path in agriculture or veterinary medicine.
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the other traits (love of nature, empathy, etc.) are less central to this field. It's possible, but the profile leans more heavily towards agricultural and veterinary sciences.
