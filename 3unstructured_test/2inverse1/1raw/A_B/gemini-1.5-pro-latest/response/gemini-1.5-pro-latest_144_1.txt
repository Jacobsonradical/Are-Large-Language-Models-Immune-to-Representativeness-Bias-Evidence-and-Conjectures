Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things. This aligns very well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. The mention of "hard work and dedication" further supports this, as these fields often require those qualities.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant to business, the other traits (love for nature, empathy for animals) are less characteristic of someone drawn to this field. It's not impossible, but the sketch points more strongly towards a science-oriented individual.
