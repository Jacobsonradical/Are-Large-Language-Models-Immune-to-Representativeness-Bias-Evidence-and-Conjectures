Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific understanding. This aligns well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and problem-solving are useful in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, management, or marketing.  Empathy and a love for animals are not traits typically emphasized in business contexts.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on limited information. It's impossible to definitively say what Adam studied without more data.
