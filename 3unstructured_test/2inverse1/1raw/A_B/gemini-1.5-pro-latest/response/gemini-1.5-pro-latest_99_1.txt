Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The sketch emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" further supports this, as these fields often require those qualities. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are relevant to business, the other traits (love of nature, empathy for animals) are less central.  It's possible for someone in business to have these interests, but they aren't as strongly suggestive as they are for agricultural and veterinary sciences.
