**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, animals, and possibly scientific inquiry. These traits align well with  "agricultural and veterinary science," hence the higher probability. 

While intelligence and an appreciation for hard work are valuable in "business administration," the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in business, finance, or management.  Therefore, the probability is lower.
