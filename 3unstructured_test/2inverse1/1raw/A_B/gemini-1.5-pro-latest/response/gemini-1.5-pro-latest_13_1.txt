Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The sketch highlights a love for nature, animals, and an understanding of hard work â€“ all common traits in those pursuing agricultural or veterinary careers. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks indicators of a strong interest in finance, marketing, or management. The emphasis on empathy and nature makes a business path less likely. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a brief personality sketch.  Individual interests are complex, and Adam could easily deviate from these predictions.
