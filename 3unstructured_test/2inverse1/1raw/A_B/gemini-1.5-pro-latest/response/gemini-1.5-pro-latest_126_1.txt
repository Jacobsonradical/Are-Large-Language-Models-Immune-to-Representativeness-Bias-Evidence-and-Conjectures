The description of Adam strongly suggests someone interested in nature and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary sciences. His enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could be applicable to many fields, but doesn't specifically suggest business administration. While some business programs might touch on empathy and understanding hard work, these traits are less central to the field than they might be in fields related to caring for living things.
