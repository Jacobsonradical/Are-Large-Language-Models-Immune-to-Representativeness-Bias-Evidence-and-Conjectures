**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, empathy (animals), and potentially scientific thinking (curiosity, puzzle-solving, abstract concepts).  

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** aligns well with these traits.  A love for animals, curiosity about nature, and intelligence are strong indicators of potential interest in these fields. 
* **Business administration**, while requiring intelligence and potentially puzzle-solving skills, doesn't have a strong correlation with the other traits.  There's nothing to suggest an aversion to business, but the emphasis on nature and animals makes it less likely.
