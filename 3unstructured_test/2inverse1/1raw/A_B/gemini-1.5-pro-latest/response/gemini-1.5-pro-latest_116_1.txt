Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  A warm heart and empathy align well with caring for animals.  These traits suggest a higher probability of Adam being in this field.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in business, finance, or management.  The emphasis on nature and empathy makes this field less likely. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many individuals in business administration could have the traits described, and not everyone in agricultural fields will perfectly match the sketch.
