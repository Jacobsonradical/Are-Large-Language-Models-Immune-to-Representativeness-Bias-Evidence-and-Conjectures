Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch heavily emphasizes traits aligned with this field: 
    * "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" 
    * "Deep love for animals"
    *  Understanding "hard work and dedication" (common in agriculture and animal care). 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business-oriented traits like ambition for leadership, financial drive, or strong interpersonal/persuasion skills. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective interpretations of the personality sketch.  Real-world student choices are far more complex and influenced by a multitude of factors beyond personality alone.
