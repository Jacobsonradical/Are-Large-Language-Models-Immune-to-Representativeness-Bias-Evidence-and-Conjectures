Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  This, combined with the mention of "hard work and dedication" (often associated with these fields), makes it more likely Adam would be in this area. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, management, or marketing â€“ common drivers for business students. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information.  Personality sketches can be suggestive, but they are not foolproof predictors of someone's field of study.
