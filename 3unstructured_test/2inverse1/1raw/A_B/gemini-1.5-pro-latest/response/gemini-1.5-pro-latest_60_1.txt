Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all strong indicators of someone potentially pursuing a career related to animals, plants, or the environment. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving skills are valuable in business, the other traits (love for animals, curiosity about nature) are less directly relevant.  It's possible for someone with these interests to pursue business, perhaps with a focus on sustainability or ethical animal products, but it's less likely than a field directly related to their passions.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a personality sketch. Individual interests and career paths are complex. There are many people passionate about nature working in business and vice versa.
