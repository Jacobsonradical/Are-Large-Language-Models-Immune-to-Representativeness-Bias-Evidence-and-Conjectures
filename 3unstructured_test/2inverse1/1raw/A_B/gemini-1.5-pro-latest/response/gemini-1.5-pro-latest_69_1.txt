**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, animals, and problem-solving.  

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** aligns well with these traits:
    *  "Curiosity about nature and plants" is directly relevant.
    * "Love for animals" is essential in veterinary science.
    * "High intelligence" and "understanding abstract concepts" are valuable in these scientific fields. 

* **Business administration** is less likely:
    * While intelligence and problem-solving are useful in business, the sketch lacks indicators of strong interest in finance, management, or economics. 

**Important Note:** This is just a probability estimate based on limited information.  Many individuals in business administration could share some of these traits, and some in agricultural/veterinary sciences might not.
