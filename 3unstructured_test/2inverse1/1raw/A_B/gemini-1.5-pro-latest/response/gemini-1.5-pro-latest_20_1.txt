**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, animals, and problem-solving.  

* **Agricultural and veterinary science** align well with these traits:
    * "Curiosity about nature and plants" is directly relevant.
    * "Love for animals" is essential in veterinary science.
    * "High intelligence" and "understanding abstract concepts" are valuable in these scientific fields. 

* **Business administration** is less likely:
    * While intelligence and problem-solving are useful in business, the sketch lacks indicators of typical business interests (finance, marketing, management). 
    * Empathy and love for animals are not as central to business as they are to fields like veterinary science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic estimate based on limited information.  Individual students within any field can have diverse personalities.
