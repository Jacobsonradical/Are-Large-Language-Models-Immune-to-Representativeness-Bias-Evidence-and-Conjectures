Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The emphasis on nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work all suggest a higher probability Adam was studying in this area.
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the other traits (love for nature, empathy, quiet demeanor) are less typical of the stereotypical image of a business student. It's still possible, but less likely given the overall profile. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on personality tendencies. Individual personalities within any field are diverse, and there's no guaranteed "type" for any academic discipline.
