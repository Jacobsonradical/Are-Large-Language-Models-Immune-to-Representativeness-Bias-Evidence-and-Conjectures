Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, animals, and potentially scientific problem-solving. These traits align well with  agricultural and veterinary sciences. While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are valuable in business administration, the sketch lacks indicators of a strong interest in business, finance, or management.
