Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  A love for nature, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work are all highly relevant to careers in agriculture and veterinary medicine. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the personality sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in business concepts, leadership, or finance, which are more typical of those drawn to business administration. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a brief sketch. Individual interests and career paths are complex, and many other factors influence a person's field of study.
