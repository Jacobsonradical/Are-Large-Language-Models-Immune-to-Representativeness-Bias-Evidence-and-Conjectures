**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific pursuits.  

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description aligns strongly with this field.  A love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in individuals pursuing these studies.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving skills are valuable in business, the other traits (love for animals, nature focus) are less central. It's possible for someone in business to have these interests, but they are not as strong of indicators.
