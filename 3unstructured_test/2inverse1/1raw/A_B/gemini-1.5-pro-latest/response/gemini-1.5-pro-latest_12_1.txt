```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The description strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, empathy (animals), and potentially scientific thinking (puzzles, abstract concepts). This makes  **agricultural and veterinary science** a much more likely fit. 

While intelligence and puzzle-solving could apply to **business administration**, the other traits are less typical. It's not impossible, but less probable based on the personality sketch alone.
