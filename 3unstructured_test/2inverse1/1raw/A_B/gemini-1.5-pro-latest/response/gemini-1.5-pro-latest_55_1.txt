Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, understanding of hard work (farming), and intelligence all point towards a higher probability of Adam being in this field.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the other traits (love for animals, nature) are less directly relevant. It's possible, but the sketch makes it seem less likely than agricultural/veterinary sciences. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not foolproof predictors of someone's field of study. Many different personalities can be successful in any field.
