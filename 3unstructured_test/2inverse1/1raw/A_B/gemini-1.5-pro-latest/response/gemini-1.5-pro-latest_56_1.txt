**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a more likely field for Adam. 

While someone in "business administration" can possess the described traits, the sketch doesn't point towards typical interests associated with that field (like economics, finance, or marketing). 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a brief sketch.  Many individuals in business administration could have these traits, and not everyone in agricultural and veterinary sciences would fit this description.
