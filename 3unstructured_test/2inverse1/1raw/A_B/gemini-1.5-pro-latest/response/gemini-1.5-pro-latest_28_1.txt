**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. These traits align well with **agricultural and veterinary science**, hence the higher probability. 

While intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities are useful in **business administration**, the sketch lacks indicators of a strong interest in business, finance, or management. The emphasis on empathy and love for animals seems less common in a typical business-oriented personality.
