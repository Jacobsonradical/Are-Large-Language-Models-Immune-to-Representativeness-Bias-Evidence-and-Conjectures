**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. These traits align more closely with **agricultural and veterinary science**.  

While intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities are useful in **business administration**, the sketch lacks indicators of typical business interests (e.g., finance, marketing, leadership). The emphasis on empathy and love for animals further reduces the likelihood.
