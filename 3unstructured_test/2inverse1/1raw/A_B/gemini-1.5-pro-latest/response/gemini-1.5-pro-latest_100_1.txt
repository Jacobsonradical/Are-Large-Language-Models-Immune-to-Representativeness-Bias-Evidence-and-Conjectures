**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely fit.  

While intelligence and puzzle-solving ability are useful in business, the other traits (love for animals, curiosity about nature) are less central to the field.  

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many individuals in business administration may share some of these traits, and not everyone in agricultural and veterinary sciences will fit this description perfectly.
