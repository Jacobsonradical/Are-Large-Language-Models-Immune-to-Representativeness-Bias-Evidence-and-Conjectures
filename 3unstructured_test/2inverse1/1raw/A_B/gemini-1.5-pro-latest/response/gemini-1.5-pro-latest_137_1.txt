**Explanation:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific fields. This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a much more likely fit than "business administration". 

While someone in business administration *could* have these traits, they are less central to the field compared to someone working directly with animals and plants.
