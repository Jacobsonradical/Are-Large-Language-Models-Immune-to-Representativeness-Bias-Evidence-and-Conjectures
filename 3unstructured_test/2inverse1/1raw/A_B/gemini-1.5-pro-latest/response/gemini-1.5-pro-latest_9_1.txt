Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily aligns with this field.  A love for nature, animals, curiosity about plants, and understanding hard work all strongly suggest this as a likely area of study for Adam. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving skills are useful in business, the other traits (love for nature, empathy, etc.) are less central to this field. It's possible Adam is in a specialized business program related to sustainability or animal welfare, but less likely than him being in agricultural or veterinary sciences.
