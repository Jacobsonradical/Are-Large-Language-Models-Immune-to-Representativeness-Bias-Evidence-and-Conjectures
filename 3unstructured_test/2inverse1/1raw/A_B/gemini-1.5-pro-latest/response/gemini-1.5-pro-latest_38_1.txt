Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. This aligns well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of interest in finance, management, or marketing.  

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information. A person's true interests and career choices are far more complex than a short personality sketch can capture.
