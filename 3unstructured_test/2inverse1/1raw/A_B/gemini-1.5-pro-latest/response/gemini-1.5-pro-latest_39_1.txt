**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, empathy (animals), and potentially problem-solving (puzzles, abstract concepts). This aligns well with  agricultural and veterinary sciences.

While intelligence and an appreciation for hard work are valuable in business administration, the other traits are less specific to this field.
