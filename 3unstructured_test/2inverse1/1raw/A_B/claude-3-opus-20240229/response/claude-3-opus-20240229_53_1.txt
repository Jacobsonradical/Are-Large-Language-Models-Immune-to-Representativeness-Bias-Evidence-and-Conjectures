Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.25"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation of hard work and dedication. These traits seem well-aligned with studying agricultural and veterinary science. 

While business administration requires intelligence and abstract thinking skills which the subject possesses, the other traits and interests mentioned are less directly relevant to business compared to agricultural and veterinary pursuits. So I estimate a lower probability for business administration.
