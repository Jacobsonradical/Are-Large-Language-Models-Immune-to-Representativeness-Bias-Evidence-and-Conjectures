Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, animals, and a warm and empathetic personality. This seems more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the sketch also mentions high intelligence, abstract thinking skills and an appreciation for hard work, which could apply to many fields including business. So while I believe it's more likely the sketch is of someone in agricultural and veterinary science, I wouldn't rule out the possibility they are studying business administration.
