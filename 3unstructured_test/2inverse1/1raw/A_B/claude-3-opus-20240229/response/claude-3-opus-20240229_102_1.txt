Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a high probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

While the subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be applicable to business administration, the personality sketch does not provide strong indicators of interest or aptitude in that specific field, so I assign a lower probability to business administration.
