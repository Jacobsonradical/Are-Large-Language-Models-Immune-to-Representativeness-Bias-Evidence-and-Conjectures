Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem much more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the traits of high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles could apply to many fields including business, so I gave business administration a non-zero but lower probability.
