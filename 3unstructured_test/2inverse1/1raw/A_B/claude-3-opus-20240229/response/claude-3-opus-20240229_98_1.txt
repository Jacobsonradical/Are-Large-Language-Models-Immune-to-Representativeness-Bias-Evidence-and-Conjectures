Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, which aligns well with someone who might pursue agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking and intelligence could fit with either field, but seem more directly applicable to the life sciences. Business administration is certainly possible but the overall description seems to fit agricultural and veterinary science better, in my estimation.
