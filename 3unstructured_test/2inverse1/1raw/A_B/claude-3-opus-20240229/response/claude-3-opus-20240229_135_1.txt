Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each given field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong interest in and empathy for animals and nature, as well as an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts. This aligns more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science than business administration. However, there is still some possibility he could be studying business administration given his intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
