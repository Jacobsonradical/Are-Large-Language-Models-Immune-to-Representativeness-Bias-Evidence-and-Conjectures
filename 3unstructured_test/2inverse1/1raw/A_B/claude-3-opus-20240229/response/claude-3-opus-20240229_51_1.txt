Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature and plants, as well as their deep love for animals and strong empathy, suggest a high likelihood of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Their high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve them well in this field.

While the subject's intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business administration, the personality sketch does not provide as much direct evidence for an interest or inclination towards that field specifically. Therefore, I assigned a lower probability to business administration compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
