Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and a love for animals specifically. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. 

While business administration requires intelligence and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which are mentioned, there is less direct overlap with the specific interests and traits highlighted in the sketch, such as curiosity about nature and love of animals.

So I estimate a significantly higher probability of around 0.7 that this describes an agricultural/veterinary science student compared to only around 0.2 for a business administration student. But there is still some possibility it could be the latter.
