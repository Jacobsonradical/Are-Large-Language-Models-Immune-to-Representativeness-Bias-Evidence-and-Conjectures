Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts. They are also empathetic and have an appreciation for hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to some business administration students, I believe they align more closely with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. That field involves working closely with plants and animals and requires both hard work and an understanding of abstract biological concepts. So I estimate a higher probability of the personality sketch matching Adam if he was an agricultural/veterinary science grad student compared to business administration.
