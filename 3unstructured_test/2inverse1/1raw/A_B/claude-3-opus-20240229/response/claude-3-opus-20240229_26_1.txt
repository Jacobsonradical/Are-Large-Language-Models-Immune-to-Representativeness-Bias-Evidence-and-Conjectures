Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.25"
}

The person described seems to have traits and interests that align more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science, such as a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication which are important in these fields. While business administration requires intelligence and abstract thinking skills which the person possesses, overall the sketch paints a picture of someone more likely to be drawn to working with nature and animals rather than a corporate business setting. Of course, additional information about the person's specific career goals and academic background would help refine the probability estimates further.
