Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking ability could also be useful in this field for scientific research and problem-solving.

While business administration requires intelligence and hard work as well, the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant. Abstract thinking is certainly useful in business, but the strong emphasis on empathy, animals and nature in the personality sketch makes me think agricultural and veterinary science is more likely for this individual compared to business administration. Of course, additional information would help refine the estimate further.
