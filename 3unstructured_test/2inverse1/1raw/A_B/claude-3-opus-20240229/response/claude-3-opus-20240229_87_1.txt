Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, which aligns more closely with someone likely to pursue agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. The abstract thinking and intelligence could apply to both fields, but overall the descripton seems to fit agricultural and veterinary science significantly better in my estimation.
