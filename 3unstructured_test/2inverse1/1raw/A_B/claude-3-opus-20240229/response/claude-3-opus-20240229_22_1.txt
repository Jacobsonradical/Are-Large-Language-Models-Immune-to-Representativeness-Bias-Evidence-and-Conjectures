Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong interest in and empathy for animals and nature. His curiosity about plants and love for animals suggests a high likelihood that he would be drawn to studying agricultural and veterinary science.

While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could serve him well in business administration, the sketch does not provide as clear of an indication that this would be his chosen field of graduate study compared to agricultural and veterinary science. However, his appreciation for hard work and dedication could lend itself to business pursuits.
