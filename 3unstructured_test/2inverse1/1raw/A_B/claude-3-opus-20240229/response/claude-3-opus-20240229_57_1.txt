Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants and animals, which aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The curiosity, intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit this field.

Business administration is certainly possible given the intelligence and problem-solving skills mentioned, but there are fewer direct ties in the personality description to typical business-related traits or interests compared to the links to agricultural and veterinary science.
