Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking. This aligns more closely with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, which tends to be more focused on management, finance, and practical business skills. However, the personality traits could potentially fit either field to some degree, which is why I did not assign a 0% probability to business administration.
