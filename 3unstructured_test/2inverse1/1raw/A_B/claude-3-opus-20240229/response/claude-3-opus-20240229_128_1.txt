Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking skills could apply to both fields, but the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to business administration.
