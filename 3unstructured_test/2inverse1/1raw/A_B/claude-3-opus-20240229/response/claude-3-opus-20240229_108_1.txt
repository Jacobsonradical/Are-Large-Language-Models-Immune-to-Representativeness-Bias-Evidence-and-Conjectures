Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each of the given fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, which I believe are more strongly associated with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, there is still a possibility that someone with those traits could be studying business administration, especially given the mention of understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication.
