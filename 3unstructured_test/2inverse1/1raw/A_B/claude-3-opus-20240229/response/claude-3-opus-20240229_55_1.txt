Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The description of genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy aligns more closely with someone likely to study agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the other traits like intelligence, puzzle-solving, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to either field, so I've assigned a non-zero probability to business administration as well.
