Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits described, such as a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem much more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. Of course, it's possible for someone with those traits and interests to study business, but I think it's significantly more likely they would gravitate towards a field involving nature, plants and animals.
