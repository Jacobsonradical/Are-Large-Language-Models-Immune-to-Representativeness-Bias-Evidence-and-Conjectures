Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. The abstract thinking and intelligence could apply to either field. So I estimate a higher probability of around 0.7 that this describes an agricultural/veterinary science grad student like Adam, and a lower but still plausible 0.3 probability for a business administration student.
