Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and a curiosity about plants, which aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. The sketch also mentions empathy and abstract thinking, which could apply to many fields. But overall, the strong focus on nature and animals makes me believe there is a higher probability Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business.
