Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes curiosity about nature, love for animals, and an understanding of hard work and dedication. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the other mentioned traits like intelligence, abstract thinking and empathy could apply to a variety of fields, so I've assigned a non-zero probability to business administration as well.
