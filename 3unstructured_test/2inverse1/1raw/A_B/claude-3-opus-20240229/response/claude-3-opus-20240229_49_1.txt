Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking and intelligence could fit with many fields including business, but overall the profile seems to lean more towards an interest in the natural world and animals. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
