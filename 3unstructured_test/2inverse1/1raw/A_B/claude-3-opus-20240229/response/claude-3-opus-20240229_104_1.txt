Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch indicates a strong interest in nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, which aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's curiosity, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication also fit with this field.

While the subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be applicable to business administration, the personality sketch does not provide strong evidence of interest or skills specifically related to that field. However, a probability of 0.3 is assigned to account for the possibility that these general traits could be applied to business administration.
