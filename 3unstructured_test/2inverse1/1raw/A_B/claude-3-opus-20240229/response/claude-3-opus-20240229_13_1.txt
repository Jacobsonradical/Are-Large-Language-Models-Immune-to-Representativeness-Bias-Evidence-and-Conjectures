Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and high intelligence align well with someone likely to pursue agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication also fit.

While business administration requires intelligence and hard work, the other traits mentioned (love of nature, animals, abstract concepts) seem less directly relevant. It's certainly possible Adam could be pursuing business given his intelligence and work ethic, but the full personality profile seems to point more towards agricultural and veterinary science in my estimation.
