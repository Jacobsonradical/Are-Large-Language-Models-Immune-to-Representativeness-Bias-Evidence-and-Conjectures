Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a love for nature, animals, and abstract thinking. This aligns more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the sketch also mentions an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could apply to both fields to some degree. Therefore, I assigned a higher probability to agricultural and veterinary science, but still a non-zero probability to business administration.
