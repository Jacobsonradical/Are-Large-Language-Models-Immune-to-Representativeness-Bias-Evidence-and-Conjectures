Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on the two fields of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.25"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem to align more strongly with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the traits of high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and problem-solving skills could apply to both fields to some degree. Overall, I estimate a significantly higher probability that this describes a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science versus business administration, based on the personality profile provided.
