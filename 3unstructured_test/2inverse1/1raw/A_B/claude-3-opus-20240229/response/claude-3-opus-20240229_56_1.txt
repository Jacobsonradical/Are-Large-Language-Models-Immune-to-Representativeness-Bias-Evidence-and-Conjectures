Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, combined with a deep love for animals and strong empathy, suggests a high probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

While the subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be applicable to business administration, the personality sketch does not provide strong indications of interest or aptitude in that particular field, so I assign a lower probability.
