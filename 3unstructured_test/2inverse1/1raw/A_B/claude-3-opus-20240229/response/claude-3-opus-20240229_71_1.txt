Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract reasoning skills could also be useful in this field for research and problem-solving.

Business administration is certainly a possibility given the intelligence and abstract reasoning abilities mentioned. However, the other traits and interests don't seem to match as strongly with typical motivations for pursuing business. So I rated it as less likely than agricultural and veterinary science based on the personality description provided, but still a realistic possibility.
