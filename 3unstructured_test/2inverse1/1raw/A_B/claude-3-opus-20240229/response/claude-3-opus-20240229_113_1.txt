Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. While it's certainly possible for someone with these traits to study business administration, the sketch provides less direct evidence to support that field of study for Adam. Of course, this is just a rough estimate based on limited information about Adam's personality.
