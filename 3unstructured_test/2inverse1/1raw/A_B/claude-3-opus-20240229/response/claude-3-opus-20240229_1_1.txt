Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.20"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. Problem-solving skills and understanding abstract concepts could also be relevant in this field. 

While business administration requires intelligence, hard work and dedication, the specific interests and traits mentioned (empathy, love of animals and nature) seem less directly relevant, so I assigned a lower probability to that field based on the given personality sketch.
