Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking. This aligns more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, which is why I assigned a significantly higher probability to that field. However, the traits described could apply to someone in business administration to some degree, so I did not assign a probability of 0 to that field.
