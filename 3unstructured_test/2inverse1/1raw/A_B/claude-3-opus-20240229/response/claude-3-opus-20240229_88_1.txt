Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking. While these traits could apply to some business students, they seem to align more closely with someone studying agricultural or veterinary science. The curiosity about plants, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication all fit well with those fields. Business administration seems less probable given the details provided, though it's certainly still possible. So I've estimated a significantly higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science compared to business.
