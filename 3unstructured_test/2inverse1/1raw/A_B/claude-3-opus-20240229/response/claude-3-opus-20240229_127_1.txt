Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication suggest a high probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet demeanor, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit well with this field of study.

While it's possible Adam was studying business administration, as those fields also require intelligence and hard work, the specific mentions of nature, plants, animals and empathy make me think agricultural and veterinary science is more likely given this limited information. Business administration is certainly possible but I estimated a lower probability based on the details provided.
