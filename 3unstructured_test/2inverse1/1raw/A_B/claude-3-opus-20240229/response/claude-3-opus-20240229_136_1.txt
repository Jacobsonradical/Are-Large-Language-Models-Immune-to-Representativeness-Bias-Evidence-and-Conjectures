Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and understanding abstract concepts. This aligns more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration. However, the sketch also mentions an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could fit with business administration to some degree. Overall though, I estimate a significantly higher probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science based on the personality traits described.
