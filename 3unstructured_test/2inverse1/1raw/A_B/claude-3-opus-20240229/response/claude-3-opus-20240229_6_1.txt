Here is my estimate of the probabilities that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and empathy for animals and nature, as well as an appreciation for hard work. This aligns well with someone studying agricultural or veterinary science. While business administration requires intelligence and hard work as well, the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to that field, so I assigned it a lower probability.
