Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each given field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking. This aligns more closely with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, which tends to be more focused on management, finance, and practical applications. However, it's certainly possible for someone with the described personality to study business, so I assigned a non-zero probability to that field as well.
