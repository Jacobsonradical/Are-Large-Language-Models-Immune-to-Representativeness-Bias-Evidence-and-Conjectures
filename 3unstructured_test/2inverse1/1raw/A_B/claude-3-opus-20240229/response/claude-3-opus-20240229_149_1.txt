Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts. They are also empathetic and appreciate hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. The curiosity about plants and love for animals in particular point more toward a student of veterinary science or agriculture. Business administration relies less on understanding nature, plants and animals directly. However, the intelligence, puzzle-solving ability and understanding of hard work and dedication could certainly apply to a business student as well, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely based on this sketch.
