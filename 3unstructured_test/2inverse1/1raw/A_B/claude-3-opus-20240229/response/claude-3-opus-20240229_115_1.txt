Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication, seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The strong empathy and warm heart also fit this field.

Business administration is certainly a possibility for someone highly intelligent who is good at understanding abstract concepts. However, the other traits mentioned don't seem to correlate as strongly with typical business pursuits, so I assigned a lower probability to that field based on the sketch provided.
