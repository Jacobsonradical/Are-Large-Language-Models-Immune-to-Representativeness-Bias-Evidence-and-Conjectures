Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.25"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants and animals. They have a curious, analytical mind and appreciate hard work. This profile seems much more aligned with someone likely to study agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the sketch doesn't rule out business entirely, as an appreciation for dedication and abstract thinking could lend itself to certain areas of business. Overall though, I estimate a significantly higher probability that this describes a student of agricultural and veterinary science.
