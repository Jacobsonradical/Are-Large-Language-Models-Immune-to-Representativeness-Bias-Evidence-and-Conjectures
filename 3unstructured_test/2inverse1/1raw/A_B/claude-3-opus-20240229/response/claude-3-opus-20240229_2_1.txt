Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts suggest a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. While business administration requires dedication and hard work which the subject appreciates, the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to that field. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
