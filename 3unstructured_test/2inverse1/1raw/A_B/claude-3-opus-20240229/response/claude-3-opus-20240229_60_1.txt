Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality traits described, including a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, I estimate a relatively high 70% probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science. Those traits align well with that field of study.

Conversely, I estimate only a 20% probability that Adam was studying business administration based on the personality description. While business certainly involves hard work, dedication and intelligence, the other traits mentioned (love of nature, animals, abstract concepts) seem less directly relevant to typical business administration studies. The personality profile reads more like someone in the life sciences than business.
