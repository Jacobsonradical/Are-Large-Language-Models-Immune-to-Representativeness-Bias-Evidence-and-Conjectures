Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration is certainly possible but the given description seems to fit more with the other field.
