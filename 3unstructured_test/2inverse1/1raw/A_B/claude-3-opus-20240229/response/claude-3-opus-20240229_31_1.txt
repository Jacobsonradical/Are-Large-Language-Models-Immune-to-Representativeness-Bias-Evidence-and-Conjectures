Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. The sketch also notes high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which could apply to both fields. However, the overall description seems to fit more closely with an agricultural and veterinary science student. Business administration is certainly possible but I judge it to be less likely based on the personality profile provided.
