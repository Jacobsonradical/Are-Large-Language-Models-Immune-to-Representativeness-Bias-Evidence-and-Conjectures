Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract reasoning skills could also be valuable in this field for research.

While business administration requires intelligence and hard work as well, the other traits around curiosity about nature, plants and animals seem less directly relevant. So I estimate a lower probability of this personality sketch matching a business administration student, though it's certainly still possible.
