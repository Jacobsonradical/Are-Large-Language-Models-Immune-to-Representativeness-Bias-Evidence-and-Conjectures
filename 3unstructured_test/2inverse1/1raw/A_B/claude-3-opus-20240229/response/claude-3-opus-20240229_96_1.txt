Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem well-aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.

While the sketch also mentions intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and problem-solving skills which could be applicable to business administration, overall the described interests and personality seem more strongly indicative of someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. Hence the notably higher probability estimate for that field compared to business administration.
