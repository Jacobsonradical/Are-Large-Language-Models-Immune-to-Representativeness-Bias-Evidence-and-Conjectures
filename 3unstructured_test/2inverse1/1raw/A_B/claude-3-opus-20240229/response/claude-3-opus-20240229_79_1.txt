Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The other traits like intelligence, abstract thinking and empathy could apply to many fields. Business administration seems less likely a match given the emphasis on nature, plants and animals in the personality sketch.
