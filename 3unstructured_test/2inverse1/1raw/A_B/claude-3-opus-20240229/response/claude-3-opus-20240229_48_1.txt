Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a love for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. These traits seem more aligned with a field like agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration. Of course, it's possible for someone to have diverse interests outside their field of study. But based solely on the personality description provided, I estimate a significantly higher probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
