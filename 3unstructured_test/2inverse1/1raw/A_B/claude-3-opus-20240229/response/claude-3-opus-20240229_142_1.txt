Here is my estimate of the probabilities that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits described, including curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking and intelligence could also fit this field.

Business administration is less likely given the personality description, as it doesn't mention any strong interest in business, management, finance, or related topics. However, the intelligence, hard work and dedication could still make it a possibility, albeit a lower one.
