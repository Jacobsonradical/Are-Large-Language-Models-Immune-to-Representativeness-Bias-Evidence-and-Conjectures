Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as a deep empathy. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking ability and intelligence could also fit with more scientific fields.

Business administration is certainly possible, as intelligence and hard work are important there, but the specific interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts seem less directly relevant to typical business studies. So I judge that field to be less likely given the personality description, but it can't be ruled out.
