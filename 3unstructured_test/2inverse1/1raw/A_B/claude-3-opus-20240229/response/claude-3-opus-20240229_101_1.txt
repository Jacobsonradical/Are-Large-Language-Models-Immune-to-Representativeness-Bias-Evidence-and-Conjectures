Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a higher probability of being in the agricultural and veterinary science field. While business administration requires intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to that field. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
