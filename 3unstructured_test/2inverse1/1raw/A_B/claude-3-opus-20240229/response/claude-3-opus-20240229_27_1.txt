Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.25"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem well-aligned with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could also fit with advanced graduate-level studies in this field.

While business administration requires intelligence and hard work as well, the other details around love of nature, animals, puzzles, and empathy don't seem to match this field quite as strongly, so I assigned it a lower probability. However, with limited information to go on, there is still some possibility Adam could have pursued an MBA or similar degree.
