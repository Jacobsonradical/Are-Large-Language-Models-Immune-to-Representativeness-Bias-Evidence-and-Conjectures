Here is my estimate of the probabilities that the personality sketch is about Adam, given his enrollment in each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking and intelligence could fit either field, but seem a bit more applicable to the scientific domain. Business administration is certainly possible given the traits described, but I believe agricultural and veterinary science is a more likely fit overall based on the personality sketch provided.
