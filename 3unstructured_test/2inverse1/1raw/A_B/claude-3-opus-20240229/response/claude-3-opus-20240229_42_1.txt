Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of having a curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a high probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

While it's possible for a business administration student to have the traits mentioned like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciating hard work, the specific interests in nature, plants and animals are less directly relevant to typical business studies, so I estimate a lower probability for that field.
