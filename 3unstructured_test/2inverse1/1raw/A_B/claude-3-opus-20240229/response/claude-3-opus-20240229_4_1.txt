Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication seem to align more closely with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the other traits like intelligence, abstract thinking and puzzle-solving skills could potentially apply to either field, so I've assigned a non-zero probability to business administration as well.
