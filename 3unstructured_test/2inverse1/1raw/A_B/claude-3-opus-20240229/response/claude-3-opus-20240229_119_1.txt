Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and high intelligence align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His quiet nature and ability to understand abstract concepts could also fit this field.

Business administration is less likely given the personality sketch, as it doesn't mention traits more commonly associated with that field like leadership, competitiveness, or extroversion. However, the subject's high intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication could lend themselves to business studies to some degree.
