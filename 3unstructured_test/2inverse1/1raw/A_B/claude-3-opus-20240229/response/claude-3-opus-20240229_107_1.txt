Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking and intelligence could also be a good fit for the scientific aspects of this field.

While business administration requires intelligence and hard work, the other traits mentioned (love of nature, animals, puzzles, and empathy) seem less directly relevant. It's certainly possible for someone with those traits to pursue business, but the overall description seems to fit agricultural and veterinary science better based on the limited information provided.
