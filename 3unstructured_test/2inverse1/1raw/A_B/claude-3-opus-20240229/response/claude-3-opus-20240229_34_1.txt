Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking, which aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration. However, the qualities of hard work, dedication and intelligence could apply to graduate students in either field, so I gave business administration a non-zero but lower probability.
