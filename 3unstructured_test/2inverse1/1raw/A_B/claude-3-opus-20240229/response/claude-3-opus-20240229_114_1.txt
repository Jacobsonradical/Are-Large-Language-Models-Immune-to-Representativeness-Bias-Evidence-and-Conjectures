Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an understanding of hard work and dedication seem much more aligned with a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the intelligence, abstract thinking ability and puzzle-solving interest could apply to either field to some degree, so I've assigned a non-zero but lower probability to business administration.
