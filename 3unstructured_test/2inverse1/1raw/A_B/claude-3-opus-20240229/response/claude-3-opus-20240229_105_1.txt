Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The sketch describes someone with a curiosity about nature, love for animals, ability to understand abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the traits could apply to some extent to either field, so I did not assign a probability of 0 or 1 to either one. The probabilities reflect my estimate that the sketch is more likely to describe an agricultural/veterinary science student than a business student, but both are possible to some degree.
