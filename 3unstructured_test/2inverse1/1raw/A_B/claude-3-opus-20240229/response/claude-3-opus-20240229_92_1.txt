Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking and intelligence could apply to many fields, but combined with the other traits, I estimate a relatively high probability of around 0.7 that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

Business administration is certainly a possibility for an intelligent, hard-working person, but the specific interests in nature, plants, animals and abstract concepts don't seem to match as strongly. So I estimate a lower probability of around 0.3 for business administration compared to agricultural and veterinary science, based on the personality sketch provided.
