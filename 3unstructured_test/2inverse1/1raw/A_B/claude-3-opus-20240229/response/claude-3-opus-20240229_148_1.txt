Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on the two given fields of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a curious and empathetic personality. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. 

While business administration requires intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts, the other traits mentioned (love of nature, animals, puzzles) seem less directly relevant. So I assign a lower probability to that field, though it's certainly still possible.
