Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes curiosity about nature, plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. This aligns more closely with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. 

The traits of being good at understanding abstract concepts and having high intelligence could apply to many fields, including business administration. However, the overall profile seems to fit better with agricultural and veterinary science based on the strong emphasis on nature, plants and animals.

Of course, this is just an estimate based on limited information. The personality sketch provides some clues but is not definitive in determining Adam's specific field of graduate study.
