Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking. This aligns more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration, which tends to be more focused on management, finance, and practical applications. However, the traits described could apply to a student in either field to some degree, so I did not assign a probability of 0 or 1 to either category.
