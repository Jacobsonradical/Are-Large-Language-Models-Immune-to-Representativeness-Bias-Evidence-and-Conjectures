Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking. This aligns more closely with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the traits of intelligence, hard work and dedication could apply to both fields to some degree.
