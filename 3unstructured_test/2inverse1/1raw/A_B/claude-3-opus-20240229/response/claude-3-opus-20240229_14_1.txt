Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants and animals, as well as an appreciation for hard work. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

While business administration requires intelligence and abstract thinking skills, which the subject possesses, overall the personality traits seem less directly relevant to business compared to agricultural and veterinary science. The sketch doesn't mention anything about leadership, competitiveness, or entrepreneurial interests that might point more toward business.

Of course, individuals can excel in fields that don't necessarily match their core personality traits. But based solely on the given information, I estimate a significantly higher probability that the sketch describes someone in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
