Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication seem more closely aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the traits of high intelligence, abstract thinking and puzzle-solving ability could apply to either field to some degree.
