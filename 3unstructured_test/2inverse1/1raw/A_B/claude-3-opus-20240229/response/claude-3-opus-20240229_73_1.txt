Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Based on the personality traits described, such as a curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, it seems much more likely that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. Of course, it's possible for someone with those traits to study business, but the overall description seems to align more closely with someone pursuing a degree related to nature, plants and animals.
