Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could fit with advanced graduate studies in this field.

Business administration is certainly a possibility given the intelligence and dedication mentioned. However, the specific interests in nature, animals and abstract concepts seem less directly relevant to typical business studies. 

Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information. The individual could potentially be studying in either field. But the described personality traits seem to me to point more toward agricultural and veterinary science in this case.
