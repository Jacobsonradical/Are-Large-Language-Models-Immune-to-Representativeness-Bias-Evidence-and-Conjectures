Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes the subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align more closely with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to business studies as well, so I've assigned a non-zero probability to that field.
