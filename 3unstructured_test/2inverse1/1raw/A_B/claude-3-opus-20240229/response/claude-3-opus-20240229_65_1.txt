Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, animals, and a strong sense of empathy. This fits well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The curiosity, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could apply to many fields including business, but the overall description seems more aligned with someone in agricultural and veterinary science, so I assigned that a higher probability.
