Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could also fit with advanced scientific study.

Business administration is certainly a possibility, but the specific interests and traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to that field compared to agricultural and veterinary science, based solely on the personality sketch provided. Of course, there are many other factors that influence choice of graduate study beyond personality alone.
