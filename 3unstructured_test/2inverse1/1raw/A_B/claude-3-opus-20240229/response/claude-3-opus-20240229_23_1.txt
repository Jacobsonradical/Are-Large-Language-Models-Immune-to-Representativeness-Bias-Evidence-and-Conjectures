Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication seem to align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration is certainly possible but the overall profile seems less directly relevant to typical traits and interests for that field, so I assigned it a lower probability. The probabilities don't need to add to 1 since they represent independent estimates for each field.
