Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking. While these traits could apply to someone in business administration, they align more strongly with a student of agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of empathy, a love for animals, and an appreciation of hard work and dedication further suggests Adam is more likely to be studying in a field related to animal care and science.
