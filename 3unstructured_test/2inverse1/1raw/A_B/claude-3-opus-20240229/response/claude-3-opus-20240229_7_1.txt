Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.25"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, animals, as well as empathy and abstract thinking. These traits seem to align more strongly with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration. However, the mention of understanding hard work and dedication could apply to either field. Without more specific information, these are my best estimates of the relative probabilities, but there is still uncertainty.
