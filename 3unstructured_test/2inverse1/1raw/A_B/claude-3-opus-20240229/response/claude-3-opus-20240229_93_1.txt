Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the other mentioned traits like intelligence, abstract thinking and empathy could apply to a wider range of fields. So while I think it's more likely the sketch is of someone in agricultural and veterinary science, I wouldn't rule out the possibility they are studying business administration.
