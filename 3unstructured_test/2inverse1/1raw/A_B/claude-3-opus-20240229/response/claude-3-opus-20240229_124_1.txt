Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. While business requires intelligence and hard work, the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to business administration compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
