Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a deep empathy and love for animals. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. 

The mention of high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could fit with many fields, including business administration. However, the overall profile seems to more strongly match someone in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business.

Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information in the personality sketch. Many additional factors would influence an individual's choice of graduate field of study.
