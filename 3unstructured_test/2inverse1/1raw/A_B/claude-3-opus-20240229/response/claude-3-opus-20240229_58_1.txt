Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align more closely with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the traits of high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles could apply to either field to some degree, so I've estimated a non-zero probability for business administration as well.
