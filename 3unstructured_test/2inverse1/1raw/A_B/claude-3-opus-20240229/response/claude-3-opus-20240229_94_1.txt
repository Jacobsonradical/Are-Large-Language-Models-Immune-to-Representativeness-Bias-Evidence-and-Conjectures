Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his graduate field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication. These seem more aligned with a field like agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration. However, the other mentioned traits like intelligence, abstract thinking and puzzle-solving skills could apply to a variety of fields, so I did not completely rule out business administration.
