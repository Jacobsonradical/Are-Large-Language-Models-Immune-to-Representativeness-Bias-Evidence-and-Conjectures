Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a curiosity about nature, love of animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication. These traits seem much more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. The abstract thinking and intelligence could apply to either field. But overall, the nature and animal-related interests make it seem significantly more probable that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science based on this personality sketch.
