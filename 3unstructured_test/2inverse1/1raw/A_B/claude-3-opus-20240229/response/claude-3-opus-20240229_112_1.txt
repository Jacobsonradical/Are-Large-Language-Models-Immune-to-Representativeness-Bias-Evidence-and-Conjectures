Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking, which aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration. However, the traits mentioned could apply to a student in either field to some degree.
