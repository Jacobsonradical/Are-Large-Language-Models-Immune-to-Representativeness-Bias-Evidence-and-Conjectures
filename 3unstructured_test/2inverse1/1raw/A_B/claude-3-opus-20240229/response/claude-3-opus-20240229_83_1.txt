Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his enrollment in each field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The description of a quiet, empathetic person with a deep love for animals and curiosity about nature aligns more closely with someone likely to pursue agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the mention of high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to both fields to some degree.
