Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking. This aligns more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, which tends to be more focused on organizations, management, and finance. However, the traits described could apply to a subset of business students as well, so I assign a non-zero but lower probability to that field.
