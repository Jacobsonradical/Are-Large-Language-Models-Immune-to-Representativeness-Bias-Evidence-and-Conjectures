Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals, combined with high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, seems to align more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the personality sketch alone does not rule out the possibility of the subject studying business administration, as qualities like dedication and hard work could be applicable there as well.
