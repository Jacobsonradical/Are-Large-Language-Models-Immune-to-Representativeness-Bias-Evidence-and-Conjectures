Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of study in graduate school:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The puzzle-solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts could also be applicable in this field.

While business administration requires intelligence and hard work as well, the other traits mentioned (curiosity about plants, love of animals, empathy) seem less directly relevant. It's certainly possible for someone with those traits to study business, but I estimate a lower probability of this personality sketch applying to a business administration student compared to an agricultural and veterinary science student.
