Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, animals, and a strong sense of empathy. This aligns more closely with someone pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, the traits of intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to both fields, so I have assigned a non-zero probability to business administration as well.
