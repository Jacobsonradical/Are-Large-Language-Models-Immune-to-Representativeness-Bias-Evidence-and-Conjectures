Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals, along with their intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, seem to align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration is certainly possible given their appreciation for hard work and dedication, but the overall profile seems to fit more closely with agricultural and veterinary science based on the personality traits and interests described.
