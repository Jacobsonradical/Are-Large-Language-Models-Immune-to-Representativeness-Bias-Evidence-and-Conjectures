Here is my estimate of the probabilities that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural or veterinary science. The abstract thinking and intelligence could fit many fields, but combined with the other traits I think it's a reasonably high probability of around 70% that this describes an ag/vet science student.

Business administration is certainly a possibility for an intelligent, hard-working person, but the emphasis on nature, animals and abstract concepts makes me think it's a lower probability fit, around 20%. Business tends to be more people and process focused vs. abstract or focused on plants and animals.
