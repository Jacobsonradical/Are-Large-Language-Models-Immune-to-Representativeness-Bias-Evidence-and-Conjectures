Explanation: Given Adam's described characteristics such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it is more likely that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, which aligns more closely with his interests and personality traits. Conversely, his personality seems less aligned with the typical areas of focus in business administration, leading to a lower probability for that field.
