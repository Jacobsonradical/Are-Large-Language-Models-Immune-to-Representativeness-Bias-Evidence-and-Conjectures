{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

The reasoning behind these values is as follows: The personality traits described—genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work—align more closely with fields related to agricultural and veterinary science. These traits are less typically associated with business administration, which often emphasizes different skill sets and interests.
