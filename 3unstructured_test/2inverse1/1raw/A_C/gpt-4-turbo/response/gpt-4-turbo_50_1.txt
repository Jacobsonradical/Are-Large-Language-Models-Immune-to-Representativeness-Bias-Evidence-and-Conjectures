Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimates:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.5"
}

Explanation:
- Agricultural and veterinary science is highly related to a love for nature and animals, which matches well with the personality described. Adamâ€™s empathetic nature and interest in living beings strongly align with common traits of students in these fields.
- Computer science, while potentially matching the high intelligence and problem-solving attributes, doesn't directly link to his interests in nature or animals. However, his enjoyment of puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are relevant, hence a moderate probability.
