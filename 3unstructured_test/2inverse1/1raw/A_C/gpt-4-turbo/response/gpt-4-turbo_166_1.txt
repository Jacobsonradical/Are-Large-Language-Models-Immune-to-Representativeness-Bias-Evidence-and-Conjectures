Based on the personality traits described, here are the probabilities for each field:

- The love for nature and plants, along with a strong empathy and a deep love for animals suggests a closer alignment with agricultural and veterinary sciences. Such fields directly engage with elements of nature, plants, and animal welfareâ€”areas that seem to resonate with the subject's interests and personality traits.
  
- For computer science, while the traits of high intelligence and a knack for solving puzzles align well, the specific interests in nature, plants, and animals are less directly connected to typical studies and professions in computer science which tend to be more technologically and mathematically oriented.
