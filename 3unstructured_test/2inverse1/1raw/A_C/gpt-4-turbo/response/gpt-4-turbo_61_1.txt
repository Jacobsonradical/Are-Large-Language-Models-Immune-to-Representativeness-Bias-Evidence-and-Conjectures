Explanation:
The high probability (0.8) for agricultural and veterinary science is due to Adam's deep interest in nature, plants, and love for animals, which correlates well with the typical interests and studies involved in these fields. 
The probability for computer science (0.5) considers his enjoyment in solving puzzles and good understanding of abstract concepts, which are common attributes in computer science students, although his specific interests in nature and animals don't align as directly with this field.
