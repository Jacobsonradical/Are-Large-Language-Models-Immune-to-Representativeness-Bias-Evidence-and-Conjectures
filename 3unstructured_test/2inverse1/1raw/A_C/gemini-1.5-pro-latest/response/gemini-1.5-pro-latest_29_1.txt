Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a short personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly leans towards this field. The emphasis on nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work aligns well with someone pursuing a career related to agriculture or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science:**  While the description mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts – traits often associated with computer science – the lack of any direct link to technology or programming makes it less likely than agricultural/veterinary science.  

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches can be misleading. Many individuals with these traits could be drawn to other fields altogether. This assessment is based purely on the limited information provided.
