Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" aligns well with these fields, making it a more likely fit. 
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects could point to computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with the field, like a passion for technology or programming. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many individuals in computer science share the traits described, and many in agricultural and veterinary sciences might not fit the entire sketch.
* Personal interests and career choices are complex. This sketch provides a glimpse, not a complete picture of Adam's aptitudes or aspirations.
