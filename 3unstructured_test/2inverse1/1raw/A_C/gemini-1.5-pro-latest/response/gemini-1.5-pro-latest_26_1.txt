**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work (appreciation for hard work). This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a good fit, hence the higher probability. 

While someone in "computer science" can certainly be intelligent and enjoy puzzles, the other traits are less specific to the field.  It's still possible, leading to a moderate probability.
