Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" aligns with the realities of these fields. This makes it more likely Adam is in this field.

* **Computer Science:** While high intelligence and an ability to grasp abstract concepts are common in computer science students, the sketch lacks strong indicators specific to this field.  The description doesn't mention anything about technology, programming, or problem-solving in a computational context. 

**Important Note:** Personality sketches offer limited information. Many individuals in computer science share the traits described, and some in agricultural and veterinary sciences might not fit the sketch perfectly. These probabilities are simply estimations based on the provided text.
