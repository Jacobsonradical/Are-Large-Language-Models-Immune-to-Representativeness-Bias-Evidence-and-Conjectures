Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  This aligns perfectly with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" further supports this, as these fields often require those qualities.
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking – all relevant to computer science –  it lacks the strong indicators we see for agricultural and veterinary science.  A person in computer science *could* have these personality traits, but they aren't as uniquely suggestive. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based solely on a brief personality sketch. Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
