Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and an understanding of hard work (often associated with these fields). This suggests a higher probability Adam might be in this field. 
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions intelligence and abstract thinking (relevant to computer science), the core themes align more strongly with natural sciences. It's still possible Adam is in computer science, but less likely given the emphasis on nature and animals. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a brief sketch.  Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
