Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work ("understanding and appreciation for hard work"). This aligns well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science:**  While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects fit the profile of someone interested in computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with the field (e.g., interest in technology, programming, software).  

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information.  Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
