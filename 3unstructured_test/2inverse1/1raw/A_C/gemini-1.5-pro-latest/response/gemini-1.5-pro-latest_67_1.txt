Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially the sciences related to them.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" further aligns with these fields. 
* **Computer Science:** While the description of being "good at understanding abstract concepts" and enjoying "solving puzzles" could apply to computer science, there's nothing specifically indicating a strong affinity for technology or programming. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based solely on a brief personality sketch. Many individuals in computer science share traits like curiosity and problem-solving abilities, and many in agricultural fields possess strong abstract thinking skills.
