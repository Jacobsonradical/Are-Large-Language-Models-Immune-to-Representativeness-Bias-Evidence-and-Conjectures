Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with an appreciation for hard work (often associated with these fields), makes it more likely Adam is studying in this area.

* **Computer Science:**  While the description mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, there's no direct indication of an interest in technology or programming.  Therefore, the probability is lower than for agricultural and veterinary science.
