Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The emphasis on nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work points towards a higher probability of Adam being in this field. 
* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence, problem-solving, and understanding abstract concepts – traits common in computer science students –  the lack of specific interest in technology or computers makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on a relatively limited personality sketch. Other factors not mentioned in the description could significantly influence Adam's actual field of study.
