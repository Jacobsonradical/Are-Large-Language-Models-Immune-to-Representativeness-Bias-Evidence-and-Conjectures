Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things.  The mention of "plants" specifically points towards agriculture or botany. This makes a career in this field more likely.
* **Computer Science:**  While the sketch mentions intelligence, problem-solving, and understanding abstract concepts – all relevant to computer science – it lacks strong indicators typically associated with the field (e.g., interest in technology, programming, or building systems). 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a limited personality sketch. Many individuals with these traits excel in either field, and other factors (like upbringing, specific interests within each field, and personal experiences) play a significant role in career choices.
