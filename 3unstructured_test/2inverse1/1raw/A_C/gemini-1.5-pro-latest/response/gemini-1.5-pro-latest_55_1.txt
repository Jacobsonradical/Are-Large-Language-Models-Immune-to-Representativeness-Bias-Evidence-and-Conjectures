Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and an understanding of hard work (common in agriculture). This makes a strong case for a higher probability in this field.

* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects align with computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical computer science interests like technology, programming, or software.  The emphasis on nature and empathy might be less common in this field. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a brief personality sketch.  Individual interests within a field vary greatly.
