Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Fit for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" further supports this, as these fields often require significant hands-on effort.

* **Possible Fit for Computer Science:** While the description doesn't directly indicate a passion for technology, the traits "enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are often associated with individuals who excel in computer science.  High intelligence is also a common factor in both fields. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on limited information. A person's true interests and career choices are complex and influenced by many factors beyond a brief personality sketch.
