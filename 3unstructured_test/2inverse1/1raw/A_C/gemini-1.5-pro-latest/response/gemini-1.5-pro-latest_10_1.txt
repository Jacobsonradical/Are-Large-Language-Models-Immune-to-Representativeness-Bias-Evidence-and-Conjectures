**Reasoning:**

While several personality traits described could fit both fields, some lean more heavily towards one or the other:

* **"Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"** and **"deep love for animals"** are strong indicators for **agricultural and veterinary science.**
* **"Enjoys solving puzzles"** and **"good at understanding abstract concepts"** are often associated with **computer science.**

The description doesn't offer strong indicators for preferring one over the other, so the probabilities shouldn't be extremely skewed. A 0.6/0.4 split reflects that the description leans slightly more towards agricultural and veterinary science but doesn't exclude the possibility of Adam studying computer science.
