Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work/dedication. These are all highly relevant to agricultural and veterinary fields, making it more likely. 
* **Computer Science:**  While high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are common in computer science students, the sketch lacks strong indicators like a passion for technology, programming, or problem-solving within a digital context.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality isn't destiny:**  Personality sketches offer hints, not guarantees. Many brilliant computer scientists love nature, and many dedicated agricultural professionals excel at abstract thought.
* **Limited information:** We only have a brief snapshot of "Adam."  His actual interests, experiences, and academic performance could significantly alter these probabilities.
