Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work ("understanding and appreciation for hard work").  This aligns well with agricultural and veterinary fields. 
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects could fit a computer science student, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with the field (e.g., interest in technology, programming, etc.). It's possible, but the other traits make agricultural/veterinary more likely.

**Important Notes:**

* **Individual Variation:** Personality sketches are broad, and many individuals in computer science share the described traits. This is just a probability estimate based on common associations.
* **Missing Information:** Knowing Adam's specific interests within his field (e.g., computational biology within computer science) would drastically change the probabilities.
