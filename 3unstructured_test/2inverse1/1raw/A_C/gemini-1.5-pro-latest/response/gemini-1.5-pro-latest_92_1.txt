  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description fits aspects of both fields, certain elements slightly favor each:

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):**  The direct mention of "nature and its various plants" and "deep love for animals" more strongly aligns with someone in this field.  

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  "Enjoys solving puzzles" and being "good at understanding abstract concepts" are often associated with computer science, though these traits are not exclusive to the field. 

The description highlights empathy and appreciation for hard work, which can be found in individuals across many fields.  Therefore, both probabilities are relatively close, with a slight edge towards agricultural and veterinary science due to the direct alignment with the subject matter.
