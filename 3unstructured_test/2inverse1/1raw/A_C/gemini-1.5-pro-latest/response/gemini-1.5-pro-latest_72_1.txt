Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  This, combined with an appreciation for hard work (often found in these fields), makes it more likely Adam is studying in this area.

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  While the description of Adam being good at puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could point towards computer science, it's not as strong of a connection as with the previous field. The sketch lacks any direct mention of technology, programming, or related interests that would strengthen this probability. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based solely on a brief personality sketch. Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
