**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, empathy (animals), and problem-solving. This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" a good fit, hence the higher probability. 

While "computer science" also involves problem-solving and abstract thinking, the sketch lacks strong indicators like a passion for technology or programming.  The description aligns more with someone who enjoys understanding living systems rather than complex digital ones.
