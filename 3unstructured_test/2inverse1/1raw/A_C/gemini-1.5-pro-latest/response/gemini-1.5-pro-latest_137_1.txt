Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This aligns very well with fields like agriculture or veterinary medicine.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" further supports this, as these fields often require those qualities.
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract concepts – traits often associated with computer science – the lack of any direct connection to technology or programming makes it less likely.  

**Important Note:** These are just estimations based on limited information. Many individuals in computer science could have the described traits, and some in agricultural/veterinary fields might not.
