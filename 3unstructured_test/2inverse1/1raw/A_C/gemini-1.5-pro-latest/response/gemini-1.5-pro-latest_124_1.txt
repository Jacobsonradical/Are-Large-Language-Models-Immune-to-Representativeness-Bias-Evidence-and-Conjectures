Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things. These traits are highly correlated with fields like agriculture and veterinary science. 
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts – traits often associated with computer science – the lack of direct interest in technology or computers makes this field slightly less likely. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are subjective and based solely on a brief personality sketch. Many other factors influence a person's field of study, including specific interests, career goals, and opportunities.
