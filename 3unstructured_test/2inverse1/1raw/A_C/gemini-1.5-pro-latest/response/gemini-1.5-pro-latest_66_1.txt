Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The emphasis on nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work all point towards a higher probability of Adam being in this field.

* **Computer Science:** While the "solving puzzles" and "understanding abstract concepts" aspects fit the profile of someone in computer science, the other traits are less specific.  It's plausible Adam could be in computer science with those interests, but the lack of stronger indicators makes the probability lower than agricultural and veterinary science.
