Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the provided sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The description emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" further supports fields related to agriculture or animal care.

* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts" which are relevant to computer science, the overall emphasis on nature and animals makes a computer science focus seem less likely. It's possible Adam enjoys computer science as a hobby or secondary interest, hence a moderate probability. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based solely on a brief personality sketch.  Many other factors influence a person's choice of study.
