Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a very limited personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  This aligns well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine.  The appreciation for hard work also fits the image of many roles within these areas. 

* **Computer Science:**  While "solving puzzles" and being "good at abstract concepts" are traits often associated with computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators specific to the field. It doesn't mention an interest in technology, programming, or mathematics beyond a general aptitude for problem-solving.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Personality is not destiny:**  People's interests and career paths are complex.  A personality sketch provides limited information.
* **Individual variation:** There are animal-loving computer scientists and puzzle-solving agricultural specialists! 
* **Graduate studies add specificity:** Knowing Adam's specific program within each field (e.g., computational biology vs. animal science) would drastically change the probabilities.
