Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  Combined with an appreciation for hard work (often found in these fields), this points towards a higher probability of Adam being in agricultural or veterinary science. 
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and understanding of abstract concepts – all relevant to computer science – the lack of direct mention of technology or programming makes it less likely than the agricultural/veterinary option. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a limited personality sketch. Many other factors influence a person's field of study, and it's impossible to be certain without more information.
