Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work (often associated with these fields). This suggests a higher probability Adam is in this area. 
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions puzzle-solving and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, the core themes lean heavily towards the natural world.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality is not destiny:** Personality sketches offer clues, not guarantees. Many computer scientists love nature, and some agricultural specialists are less outwardly empathetic.
* **Limited Information:** We only have a brief sketch.  Factors like Adam's upbringing, specific interests within his field, and life experiences could significantly influence his actual field of study.
