Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  Combined with the mention of appreciating hard work (often associated with these fields), this makes a career in agricultural or veterinary science more likely. 
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and understanding abstract concepts – all relevant to computer science – the lack of any direct mention of technology or programming makes it less likely than agricultural/veterinary science. However, it's still possible, as many people in computer science have diverse interests like nature and empathy. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information. A person's chosen field of study can be influenced by a wide range of factors not captured in a personality sketch.
