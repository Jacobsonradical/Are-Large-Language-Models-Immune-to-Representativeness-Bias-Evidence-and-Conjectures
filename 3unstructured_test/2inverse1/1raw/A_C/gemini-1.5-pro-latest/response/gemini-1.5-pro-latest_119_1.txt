Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The sketch emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals, along with an appreciation for hard work â€“ all common traits in these areas. 
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" aspect and "high intelligence" could point to computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with the field, such as a passion for technology, coding, or software. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimations based on a brief personality sketch. Many individuals in computer science share these traits, and some in agricultural and veterinary sciences might not.  Personality is complex, and these fields attract a diverse range of individuals.
