**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work ("understanding and appreciation for hard work").  These traits align more closely with **agricultural and veterinary science**.

While the sketch mentions intelligence and abstract thought, which are relevant to **computer science**, it lacks the common indicators of a strong affinity for technology, programming, or problem-solving within a digital realm. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based solely on a brief personality sketch and are not definitive. Many individuals in computer science share these traits, and many in agricultural/veterinary fields might not.
