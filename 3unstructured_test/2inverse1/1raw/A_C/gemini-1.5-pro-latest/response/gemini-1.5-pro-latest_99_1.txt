Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests an affinity for nature ("genuine curiosity about plants", "deep love for animals"). This aligns perfectly with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine.  
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts" which are relevant to computer science,  there's nothing specifically indicating a strong pull towards technology or programming. A person with these traits could excel in various fields.

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch. Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
