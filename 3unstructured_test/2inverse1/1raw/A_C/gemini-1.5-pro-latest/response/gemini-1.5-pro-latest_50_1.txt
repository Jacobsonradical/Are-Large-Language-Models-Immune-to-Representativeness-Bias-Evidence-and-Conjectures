Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  A love for nature, animals, curiosity about plants, and an appreciation for hard work are all strong indicators of someone who might be drawn to agricultural or veterinary studies.

* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, it lacks specific indicators typically associated with the field like a passion for technology, coding, or problem-solving using computers.  The warm heart, empathy, and love for nature are less common drivers for choosing computer science. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch. There's overlap between the types of individuals drawn to both fields, and many other factors influence a person's choice of study.
