Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a very short personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature ("genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants", "deep love for animals"). This makes fields like agricultural science or veterinary medicine quite likely. 
* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions "enjoying solving puzzles" and "understanding abstract concepts," which are relevant to computer science, these traits are not exclusive to the field. The sketch lacks strong indicators of a passion for technology or programming often associated with computer science students.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are very limited. Many individuals with these traits could be found in either field, and many other factors influence career choice.
