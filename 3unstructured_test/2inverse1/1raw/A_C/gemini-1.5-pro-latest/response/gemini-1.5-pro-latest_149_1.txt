Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with an appreciation for hard work (often found in these fields), makes it more likely Adam is studying in this area.
* **Computer science:** While the sketch mentions intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science,  there's no direct link to technology or programming.  A love for puzzles could suggest an affinity for logic and problem-solving, but it's not exclusive to computer science. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on limited information.  A deeper understanding of Adam's interests, hobbies, and specific skills would lead to a more accurate assessment.
