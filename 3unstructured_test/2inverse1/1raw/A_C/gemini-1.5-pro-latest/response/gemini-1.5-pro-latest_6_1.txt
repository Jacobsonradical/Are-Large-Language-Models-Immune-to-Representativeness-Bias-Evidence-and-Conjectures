Here's an estimated probability based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "computer science": "0.45"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong correlation with Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. The appreciation for hard work also fits well with the hands-on nature of these fields.

* **Possible, but weaker, correlation with Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and understanding abstract concepts – all relevant to computer science – it lacks specific indicators commonly associated with the field (e.g., interest in technology, programming, coding). 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch.  Many individuals in computer science share the described traits, and many in agricultural and veterinary sciences might not.  Personality is just one factor in career choice.
