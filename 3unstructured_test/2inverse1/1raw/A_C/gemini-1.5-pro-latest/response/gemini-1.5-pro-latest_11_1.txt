Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" aligns well with these fields. This makes it more likely Adam was in this field.
* **Computer science:** While the sketch mentions "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts," which are relevant to computer science, the emphasis on nature and animals is less typical. It's still possible, as people in computer science can have diverse interests, but less probable based on the provided information. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a limited personality sketch. There's overlap between the personality traits and the fields, and individual interests can vary greatly.
