Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with an appreciation for hard work (often associated with these fields), makes it more likely Adam is studying in this area.

* **Computer Science:**  While the sketch mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, the lack of direct interest in technology or computers makes it less likely.  

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information.  Many individuals with these personality traits could be found in either field.
