Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature ("genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"), a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work (common in agricultural fields). This makes it more likely Adam is studying in this area.

* **Computer Science:**  While the description mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding abstract concepts – traits often associated with computer science – it lacks specific indicators like a passion for technology or programming. The emphasis on empathy and nature leans away from a typical computer science student profile. 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are subjective and based on limited information. Individual personalities within any field can vary greatly.
* The probabilities don't have to add up to 1 because they represent independent likelihoods, not mutually exclusive outcomes. Adam could be in a field that combines elements of both, or something completely different.
