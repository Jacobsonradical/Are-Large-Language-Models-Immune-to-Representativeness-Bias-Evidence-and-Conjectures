Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is speculative based on personality alone:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work (implied by appreciating hard work).  This aligns well with agricultural and veterinary fields. 
* **Computer Science:**  While intelligence and abstract thinking are valuable in computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators of a passion for technology, programming, or systems that are typical of many drawn to this field.  It's possible, but the personality fit seems weaker.

**Important Note:**  Personality is just one factor in career choice.  Adam's specific interests within computer science (like AI with a biological focus) or life experiences could easily shift these probabilities.
