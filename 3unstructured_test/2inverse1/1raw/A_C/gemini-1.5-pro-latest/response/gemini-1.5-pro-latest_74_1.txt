Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things.  The mention of "plants" specifically points towards agriculture or botany. This makes a career in agricultural and veterinary science quite likely.
* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding abstract concepts – all relevant to computer science – it lacks the typical markers of a strong affinity for technology, programming, or systems. The emphasis on empathy and nature makes computer science less probable, but not impossible. Many computer scientists are driven by applying their skills to fields like bioinformatics or computational biology, which could align with the described interests. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are subjective interpretations of a limited personality sketch. There's not enough information to definitively say what Adam studied.
