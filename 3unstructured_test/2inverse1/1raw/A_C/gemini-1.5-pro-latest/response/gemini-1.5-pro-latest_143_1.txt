Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind that this is based on a very short personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Fit for Agricultural/Veterinary Science:**  The description heavily emphasizes nature, plants, animals, empathy, and an appreciation for hard work. These traits are highly aligned with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Possible Fit for Computer Science:** While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are important in computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators of a passion for technology, programming, or problem-solving within a digital realm.  

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that personality sketches are very limited. People are complex, and this sketch might not capture all of Adam's interests and skills.
