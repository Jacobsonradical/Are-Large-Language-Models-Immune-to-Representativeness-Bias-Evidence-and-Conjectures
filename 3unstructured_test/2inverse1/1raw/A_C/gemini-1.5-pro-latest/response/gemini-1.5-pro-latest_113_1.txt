Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests a person drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific understanding. The mention of "plants" and "love for animals" makes this field highly probable. 
* **Computer Science:**  While the description mentions "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts," which are relevant to computer science, the other traits (love for nature, animals, empathy) are less typical for this field. It's possible, but the profile leans more heavily towards life sciences.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on stereotypes associated with the fields. Individual personalities within any field can vary greatly.
