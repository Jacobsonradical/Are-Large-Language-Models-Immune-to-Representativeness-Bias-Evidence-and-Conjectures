Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The emphasis on nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work all point towards a higher probability of Adam being in this area.

* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts," which are relevant to computer science, the other traits (love for nature, animals, empathy) are less common stereotypes for this field. Thus, the probability is lower, but not impossible. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on common stereotypes.  Individual personalities within any field are diverse, and this assessment is not definitive.
