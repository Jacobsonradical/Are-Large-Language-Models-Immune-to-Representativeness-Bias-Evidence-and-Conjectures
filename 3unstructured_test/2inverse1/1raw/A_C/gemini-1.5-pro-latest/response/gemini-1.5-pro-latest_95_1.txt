Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This aligns very well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. The mention of "hard work and dedication" further supports this, as these fields often demand those qualities.
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and understanding abstract concepts – all relevant to computer science – the core themes (nature, animals, empathy) are less directly connected.  It's possible Adam's interests in puzzles and abstract thinking drew him to computer science, hence a moderate probability. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
