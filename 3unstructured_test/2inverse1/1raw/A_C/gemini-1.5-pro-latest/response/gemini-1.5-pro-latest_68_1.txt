Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially the sciences related to them.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" also aligns with fields like agriculture and veterinary medicine.
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects hint at possible aptitude for computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with the field (e.g., interest in technology, programming, etc.).  

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information.  Personality sketches can be suggestive, but they are not definitive predictors of a person's field of study.
