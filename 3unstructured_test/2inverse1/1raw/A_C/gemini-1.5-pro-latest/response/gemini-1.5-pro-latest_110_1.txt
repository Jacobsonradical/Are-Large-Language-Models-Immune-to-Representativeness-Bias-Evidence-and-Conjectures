Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work (appreciation for hard work). This aligns well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects fit the profile of someone in computer science, the other traits (love for animals, nature) are less directly related. It's possible, but the sketch doesn't point as strongly towards computer science.

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information.  Personality sketches are not definitive predictors of someone's field of study.
