Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  This points towards a higher probability of Adam being in a field related to these interests.
* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding abstract concepts - traits often associated with computer science - it lacks specific indicators like a passion for technology or programming.  Therefore, the probability is moderate but lower than agricultural and veterinary science.
