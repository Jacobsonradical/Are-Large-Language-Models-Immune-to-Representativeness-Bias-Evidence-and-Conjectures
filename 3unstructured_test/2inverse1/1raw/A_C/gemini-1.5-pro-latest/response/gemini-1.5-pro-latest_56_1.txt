Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The sketch emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals, which are central to agriculture and veterinary work.  The mention of hard work and dedication further supports this, as these fields often require significant effort.

* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions intelligence, problem-solving, and understanding abstract concepts—traits often associated with computer science—there's no direct connection to technology or programming.  A quiet, empathetic person with a love of nature could still be drawn to computer science, but the profile doesn't offer strong evidence for it. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based solely on the provided personality sketch.  Many other factors influence a person's choice of field.
