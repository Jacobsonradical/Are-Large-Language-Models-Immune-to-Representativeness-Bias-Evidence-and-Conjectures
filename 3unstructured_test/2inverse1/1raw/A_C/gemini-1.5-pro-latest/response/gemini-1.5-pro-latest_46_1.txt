Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things.  This makes a field related to agriculture or animal care quite likely.
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking – traits common in computer science students – the lack of any direct connection to technology or programming makes it less probable than agricultural/veterinary science. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information. Many other fields could also be possibilities for Adam.
