Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work ("understanding and appreciation for hard work"). This aligns well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine.
* **Computer science:** While "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts" could apply to computer science, the other traits (love for animals, curiosity about nature) are less typical indicators of someone drawn to this field. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just estimates based on limited information.  Personality is not a perfect predictor of academic or career choices. 
* Many individuals in computer science have diverse interests, and some might be drawn to the problem-solving aspects alongside a love for nature.
