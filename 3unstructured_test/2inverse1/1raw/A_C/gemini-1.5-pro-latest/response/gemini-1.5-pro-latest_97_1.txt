Here's an estimated probability based on the personality description:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily leans towards interests aligning with this field: 
    * "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" 
    * "Deep love for animals"
    * "Understanding and appreciation for hard work" (often associated with these fields)

* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions "enjoying solving puzzles" and being "good at understanding abstract concepts," which are relevant to computer science, the other traits point more strongly towards agricultural and veterinary sciences. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch. Many individuals with these traits could succeed in either field, and there's significant overlap between the skills and interests required for both.
