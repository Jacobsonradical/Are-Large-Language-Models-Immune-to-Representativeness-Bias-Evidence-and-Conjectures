Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  This aligns perfectly with fields like agriculture and veterinary science. The mention of "hard work and dedication" further supports this, as these fields often demand those qualities. 
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch highlights intelligence and an ability to grasp abstract concepts – traits often associated with computer science –  there's nothing specifically indicating a passion for technology, programming, or problem-solving in a computational context.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on a limited personality sketch. It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. Many individuals in computer science share a love for nature, and many in agricultural fields excel in abstract thinking.
