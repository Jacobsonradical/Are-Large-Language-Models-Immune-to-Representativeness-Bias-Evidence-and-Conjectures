Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work ("understanding and appreciation for hard work").  This aligns well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts" which are relevant to computer science, the other traits point more strongly towards a connection with the natural world. It's possible for someone interested in computer science to have these other traits, but it's not as strong a correlation. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on limited information.  Many individuals in computer science enjoy nature, and many in agricultural fields are drawn to the problem-solving aspects of their work.
