Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing these careers. 
* **Computer science:** While the description mentions intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, it lacks specific indicators like a passion for technology or problem-solving using computers.  

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are subjective and based on general stereotypes associated with the fields. There are many exceptions.
* A personality sketch alone is not a reliable predictor of someone's field of study. Many other factors influence career choices.
