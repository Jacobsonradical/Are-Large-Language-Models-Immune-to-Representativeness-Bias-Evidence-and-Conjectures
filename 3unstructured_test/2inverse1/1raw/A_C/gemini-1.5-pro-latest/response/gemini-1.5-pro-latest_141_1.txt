Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" aligns with these fields, making it more likely.
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch highlights intelligence and abstract thinking often associated with computer science, the core interests aren't as strong a match as with agricultural and veterinary sciences.  

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many individuals in computer science share the described traits, and there could be aspects of Adam's personality not captured in the sketch that might make him a perfect fit for that field.
