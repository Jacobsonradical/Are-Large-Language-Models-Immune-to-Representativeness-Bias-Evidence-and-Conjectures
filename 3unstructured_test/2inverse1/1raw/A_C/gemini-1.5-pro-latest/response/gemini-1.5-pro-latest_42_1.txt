Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The sketch emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. Additionally, the appreciation for hard work and dedication fits well with the demands of these fields.

* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, there's no direct indication of an interest in technology, programming, or related areas.  Therefore, the probability is lower. 

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses based on a limited personality sketch. Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
