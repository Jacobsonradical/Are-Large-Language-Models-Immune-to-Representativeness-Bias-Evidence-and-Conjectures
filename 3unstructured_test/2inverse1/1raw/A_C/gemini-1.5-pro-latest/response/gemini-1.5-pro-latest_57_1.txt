Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a very limited personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific understanding.  This aligns well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" aspect and "high intelligence" could point towards computer science, the sketch lacks clear indicators of a passion for technology, programming, or abstract systems that often draw people to this field. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality is not destiny:**  Personality sketches provide very limited information. Many personality types can excel in various fields. 
* **Individual variation:**  There are "animal-loving" computer scientists and "puzzle-solving" agricultural specialists. Stereotypes don't represent the full picture. 
* **Graduate student demographics:** Base rates (the overall percentage of graduate students in each field) could play a role, but we don't have that data.
