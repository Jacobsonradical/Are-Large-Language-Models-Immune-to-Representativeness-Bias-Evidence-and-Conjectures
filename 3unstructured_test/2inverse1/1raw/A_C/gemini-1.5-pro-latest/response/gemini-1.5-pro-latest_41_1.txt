Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based purely on the personality sketch and some stereotypical associations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things. These align well with fields like agriculture and veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science:**  While the sketch mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking – traits often associated with computer science –  the lack of any direct mention of technology or computers makes it less likely. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are very limited!  Many people who love nature don't go into agricultural fields, and many brilliant computer scientists are deeply empathetic animal lovers. This is just a probabilistic guess based on limited information.
