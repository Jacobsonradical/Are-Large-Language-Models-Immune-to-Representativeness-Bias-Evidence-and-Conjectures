Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This, coupled with an appreciation for hard work (often found in these fields), makes it more likely Adam is studying in this area. 
* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and understanding abstract concepts – all relevant to computer science – it lacks the specific passion for technology or problem-solving within a digital realm often seen in computer science students.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on stereotypes and limited information. There are many compassionate and nature-loving computer scientists and many analytically minded individuals in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
