Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on personality stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things. This aligns well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking (traits common in computer science), the lack of specific interest in technology or computers makes it seem less likely.

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality is not destiny:** This is a highly simplified assessment. Many computer scientists love nature, and many agricultural specialists are drawn to the analytical aspects of their field.  
* **Limited information:** We know very little about Adam's specific skills, interests, or goals beyond this sketch.  

It's impossible to definitively say what Adam studied based solely on personality.
