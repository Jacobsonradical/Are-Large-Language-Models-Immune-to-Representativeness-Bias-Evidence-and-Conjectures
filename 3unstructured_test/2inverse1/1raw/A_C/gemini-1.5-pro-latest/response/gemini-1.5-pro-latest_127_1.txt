Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly suggests an affinity for nature ("genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"), empathy ("warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals"), and potentially hands-on work ("understanding and appreciation for hard work"). These traits align well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 

* **Computer Science:** While the "solving puzzles" and "understanding abstract concepts" aspects hint at potential aptitude for computer science, the description lacks strong indicators of a passion for technology, programming, or systems.  A quiet, nature-loving individual might still be drawn to computer science, but it's not as strong a fit as the other field based on the provided information.
