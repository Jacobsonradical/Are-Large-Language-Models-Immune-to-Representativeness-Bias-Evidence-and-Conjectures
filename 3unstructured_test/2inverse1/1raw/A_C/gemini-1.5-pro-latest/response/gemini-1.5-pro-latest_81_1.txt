Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine.  The appreciation for hard work also fits agricultural fields.
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence could point towards computer science, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in technology, programming, or abstract mathematical systems â€“ areas often associated with computer science students. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a brief sketch.  People are complex, and many individuals in computer science might share some of the described traits.  Conversely, the sketch might not capture all of Adam's interests.
