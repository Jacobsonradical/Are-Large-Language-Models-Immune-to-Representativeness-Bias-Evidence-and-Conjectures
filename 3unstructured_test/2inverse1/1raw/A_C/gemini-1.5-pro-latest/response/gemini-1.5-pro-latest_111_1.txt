Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and not concrete data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This aligns very well with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. The mention of "hard work and dedication" further supports this, as these fields often involve demanding physical and emotional labor.

* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts," which are relevant to computer science, the core emphasis on nature and animals makes this field seem less likely.  A student passionate about computer science might have descriptions focusing on technology, logic, or problem-solving in a more digital context. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches can be misleading. Many individuals in computer science share a love for nature, and many in agricultural fields excel in abstract thinking. These probabilities are simply estimations based on the provided information.
