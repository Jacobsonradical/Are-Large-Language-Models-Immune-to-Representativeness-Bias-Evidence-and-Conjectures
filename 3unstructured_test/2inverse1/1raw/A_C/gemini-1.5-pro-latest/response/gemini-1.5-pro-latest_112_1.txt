Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work are all strong indicators of someone potentially interested in agricultural or veterinary sciences. 
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" aspect and high intelligence could suggest an inclination towards computer science, the other traits (love for animals, empathy, nature interest) are less typical of the field's stereotype.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on generalizations and stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field are diverse, and this assessment should not be taken as definitive.
