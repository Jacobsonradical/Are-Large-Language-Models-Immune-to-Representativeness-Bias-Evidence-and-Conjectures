Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  Combined with the appreciation for hard work (often associated with these fields), this suggests a higher probability Adam is studying agricultural or veterinary science.

* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding abstract concepts – all relevant to computer science – the lack of direct interest in technology or programming makes it less likely.  However, these traits are still common in computer science students, resulting in a moderate probability.
