Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" also aligns well with these fields. This makes it more likely Adam is studying something related to these areas.

* **Computer Science:**  While the sketch highlights intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and understanding of abstract concepts – traits often associated with computer science – the lack of direct connection to technology makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science. However, it's still possible, as people with these personality traits can be drawn to various fields.
