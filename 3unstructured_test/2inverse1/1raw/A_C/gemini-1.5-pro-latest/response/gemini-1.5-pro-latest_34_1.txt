Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This strongly suggests an affinity for fields like agriculture or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer science:** While high intelligence and an ability to grasp abstract concepts are common traits in computer science students, the description lacks strong indicators typically associated with this field (e.g., interest in technology, programming, etc.). 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch. There's significant overlap between the traits mentioned and various academic fields.  
*  Many individuals in computer science may share the described love for nature and animals. 
* A true assessment would require much more information about Adam's interests, experiences, and goals.
