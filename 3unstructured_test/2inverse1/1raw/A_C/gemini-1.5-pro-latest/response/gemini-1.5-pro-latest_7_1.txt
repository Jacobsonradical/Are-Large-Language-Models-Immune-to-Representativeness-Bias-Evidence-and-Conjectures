Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  This aligns very well with fields like agriculture and veterinary medicine. The appreciation for hard work and dedication further supports this, as these fields often require significant effort.

* **Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding abstract concepts – traits often associated with computer science – the lack of any direct interest in technology or computers makes it less likely.  However, it's still possible, as people in computer science can have diverse interests. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information.  Personality sketches can offer clues, but they don't definitively determine someone's field of study.
