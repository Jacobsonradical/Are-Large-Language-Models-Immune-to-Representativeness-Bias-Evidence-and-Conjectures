Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Correlation with Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This strongly suggests a higher probability of Adam being in a field related to agriculture or veterinary science. 
* **Possible, but Weaker Correlation with Computer Science:** While the sketch mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking – traits often associated with computer science – these are not exclusive to the field.  The absence of any direct mention of technology or programming weakens the connection.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based solely on a brief personality sketch.  Many other factors (interests, experiences, goals) influence a person's field of study.
