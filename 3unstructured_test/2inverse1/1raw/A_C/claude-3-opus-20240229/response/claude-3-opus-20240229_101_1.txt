Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and an ability to understand abstract concepts. These traits could align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles and high intelligence could also fit with a computer science student, but the emphasis on nature, plants and animals in the personality sketch makes me estimate a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
