Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than computer science. However, the traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could fit well with computer science too. So while I think it's more likely the personality sketch is of a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science, I wouldn't rule out computer science either based on the personality description.
