Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature and plants, as well as their deep love for animals, suggests a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. Their appreciation for hard work and dedication is also a valuable trait in this field.

While the subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could indicate an aptitude for computer science, the personality sketch does not explicitly mention an interest in technology or programming. Therefore, I assigned a lower probability to computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
