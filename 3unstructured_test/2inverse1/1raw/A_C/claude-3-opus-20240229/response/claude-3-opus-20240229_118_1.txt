Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy seem to align more strongly with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, the traits of enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could apply to either field. Overall, I estimate a higher probability that this describes a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science vs. computer science, but both are plausible based on the limited information provided.
