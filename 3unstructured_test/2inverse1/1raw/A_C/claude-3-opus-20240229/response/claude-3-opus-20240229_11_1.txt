Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and an ability to understand abstract concepts. While the abstract thinking ability could fit well with computer science, the other traits seem to align more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. The empathy, love of animals, and interest in nature and plants all point more towards agricultural and veterinary science as a likely field of study for the individual described.
