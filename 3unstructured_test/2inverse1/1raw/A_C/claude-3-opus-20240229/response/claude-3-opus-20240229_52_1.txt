Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on his enrollment in each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and puzzle-solving skills. These align more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science than computer science, so I assigned a higher probability to that field. However, the sketch also mentions high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, so I still assigned a moderately high probability to that field as well.
