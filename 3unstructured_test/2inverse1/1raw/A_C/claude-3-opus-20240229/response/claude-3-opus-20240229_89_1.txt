Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and abstract thinking abilities, which align well with agricultural and veterinary science. The puzzle-solving skills and high intelligence could also fit with computer science to some degree. However, the emphasis on nature, plants, animals and hard work dedication makes me assign a higher probability to agricultural and veterinary science overall for this particular personality profile.
