Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking. This fits well with agricultural and veterinary science. The curiosity, intelligence and puzzle-solving aspects could fit with computer science, but the overall profile seems to lean more towards agricultural and veterinary pursuits based on the emphasis on nature, animals and empathy.
