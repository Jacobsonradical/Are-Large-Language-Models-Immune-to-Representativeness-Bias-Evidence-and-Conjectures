Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, the sketch also mentions an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, which could fit well with computer science. Overall, I believe the personality is more likely to match someone in agricultural and veterinary science, but there is still a reasonable probability it could describe a computer science student.
