Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a love of nature, plants and animals, as well as a strong sense of empathy. This aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. 

The sketch also mentions high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles. These traits could fit with computer science to some degree.

However, the overall description seems to lean more towards an interest in the natural world rather than technology, which is why I assigned a higher probability to agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. The probabilities don't necessarily add to 1 since the person could potentially be interested in both fields to varying degrees.
