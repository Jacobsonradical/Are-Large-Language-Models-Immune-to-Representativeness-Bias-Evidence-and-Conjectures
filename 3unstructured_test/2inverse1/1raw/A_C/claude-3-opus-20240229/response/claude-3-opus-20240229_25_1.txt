Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given his enrollment in each respective field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, which aligns more closely with interests typical of someone in agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science, but overall the description seems to lean more towards agricultural and veterinary science based on the strong focus on nature and animals.
