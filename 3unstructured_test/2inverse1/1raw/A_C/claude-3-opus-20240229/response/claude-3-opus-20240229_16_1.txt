Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. However, the sketch also mentions enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts well, which could fit with computer science too. Overall, I think the personality traits lean more towards agricultural and veterinary science being a likely field of study for Adam compared to computer science, but both are plausible to some degree based on the given information.
