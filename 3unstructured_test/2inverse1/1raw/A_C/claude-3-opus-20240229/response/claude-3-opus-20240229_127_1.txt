Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science, but seem less specific to that field compared to the alignment of the other traits with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the sketch being about Adam if he was studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
