Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, which seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. However, it also mentions enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and being good at understanding abstract concepts, which could fit well with computer science. So while I think agricultural and veterinary science is more likely given the details provided, I still think there is a reasonable chance the sketch could be describing a computer science student.
