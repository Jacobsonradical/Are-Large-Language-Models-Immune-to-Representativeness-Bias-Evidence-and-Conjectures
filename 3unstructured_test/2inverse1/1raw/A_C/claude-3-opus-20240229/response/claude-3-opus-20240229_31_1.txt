Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, given his field of graduate study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking. While these traits could apply to a computer science student, they seem to more strongly align with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The curiosity about plants, empathy and love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication all point more towards that field. However, the traits of intelligence, abstract thinking and puzzle-solving do fit well with computer science too. So while both are plausible, I estimate a higher probability of around 0.9 that this describes a veterinary/agricultural science student like Adam, and a lower but still substantial probability around 0.6 that it could describe a computer science student.
