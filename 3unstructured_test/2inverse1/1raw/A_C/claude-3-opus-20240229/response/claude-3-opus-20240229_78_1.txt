Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on the two fields of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The sketch mentions a love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, as well as empathy. These traits seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The mention of high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles could fit with computer science to some degree. However, the overall description seems to lean more towards an interest in the natural world rather than technology and computing.
