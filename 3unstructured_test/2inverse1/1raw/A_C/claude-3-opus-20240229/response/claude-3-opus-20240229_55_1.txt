Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch highlights a strong curiosity about nature and plants, as well as a deep love for animals, which aligns well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. However, the subject is also noted to have high intelligence, be good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoy solving puzzles, which are traits that could fit well with computer science. Given the stronger emphasis on nature, plants and animals, I estimate a higher probability of 0.8 for agricultural and veterinary science compared to 0.6 for computer science, but both are plausible given the personality description.
