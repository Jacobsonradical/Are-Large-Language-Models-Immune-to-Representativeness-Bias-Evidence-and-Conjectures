Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in that field in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could also fit with computer science to some degree. However, overall the description seems to more strongly match agricultural and veterinary science based on the emphasis on nature, plants and animals.
