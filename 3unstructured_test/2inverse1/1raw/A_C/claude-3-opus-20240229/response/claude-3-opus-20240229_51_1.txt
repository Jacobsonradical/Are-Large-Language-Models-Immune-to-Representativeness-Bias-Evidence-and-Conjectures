Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of study in graduate school:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love for animals, an appreciation of nature and plants, as well as abstract thinking and problem solving skills. While the abstract thinking and problem solving could fit well with computer science, the other traits mentioned (love of animals and nature) seem more strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a higher probability that this sketch describes someone in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
