Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on the two fields of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch indicates a strong interest in nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, which aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could also fit with computer science, but the overall description seems to lean more towards an affinity for the natural world and animals. Therefore, I estimated a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
