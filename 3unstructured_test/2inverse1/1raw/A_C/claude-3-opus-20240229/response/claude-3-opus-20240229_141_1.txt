Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a deep curiosity about nature, plants and animals, as well as strong empathy and love for animals. This aligns more closely with a student pursuing agricultural and veterinary science.

The skills of puzzle-solving, high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could fit well with computer science. However, the overall profile seems more geared towards someone studying veterinary science or a related agricultural field given the repeated emphasis on animals, plants and nature.

Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information. The individual could certainly be enrolled in computer science while still holding those interests. But based solely on the personality sketch, I judge agricultural and veterinary science to be the more probable field of study for Adam.
