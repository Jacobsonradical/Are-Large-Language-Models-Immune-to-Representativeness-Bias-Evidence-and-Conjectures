Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's love of nature, plants and animals along with their strong empathy and dedication suggests a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science.

Their intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzle solving could also fit well with computer science. However, the personality sketch focuses more on traits that align with agricultural and veterinary fields.
