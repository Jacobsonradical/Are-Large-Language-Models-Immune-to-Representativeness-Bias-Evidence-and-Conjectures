Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and empathy, which seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. However, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could fit well with computer science too. So while I think agricultural and veterinary science is more likely given the personality description, I still think there's a fairly good chance it could describe a computer science student as well.
