Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each of the given fields, assuming Adam was a graduate student in that field in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, animals, and abstract thinking. This seems to align more strongly with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. The curiosity about nature, empathy and love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication point more toward agricultural and veterinary pursuits.

While the sketch does mention high intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and an understanding of abstract concepts, which could apply to computer science, overall the description seems to fit better with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Hence the higher probability estimate for that field.
