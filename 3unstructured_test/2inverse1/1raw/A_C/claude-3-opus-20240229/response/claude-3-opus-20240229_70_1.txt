Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Problem-solving skills and high intelligence are also valuable in this field.

While the traits of enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, the overall sketch seems more indicative of someone drawn to working with nature and animals. So I estimated a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, based on the information provided.
