Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes curiosity about nature, plants, a love for animals, and empathy. This aligns more strongly with interests typical of someone in agricultural and veterinary science. 

While traits like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles could fit well with computer science, the overall profile seems to lean more towards agricultural and veterinary science based on the strong emphasis on nature, plants and animals. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on the limited information provided.
