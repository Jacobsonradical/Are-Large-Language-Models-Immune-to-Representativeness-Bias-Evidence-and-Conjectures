Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on his graduate field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes curiosity about nature, plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align well with someone studying agricultural or veterinary science.

While the sketch also mentions intelligence, understanding abstract concepts and enjoying puzzles, which could fit with computer science, overall the nature and animal-focused traits seem more prominent. So I estimate a higher probability of the sketch being about Adam if he studied agricultural/veterinary science compared to computer science.
