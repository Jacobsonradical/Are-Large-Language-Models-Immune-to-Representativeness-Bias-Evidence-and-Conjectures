Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants and animals, which aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with either field, but the curiosity about nature and love for animals makes agricultural and veterinary science a more likely fit in my estimation.

Computer science also requires high intelligence and abstract thinking, so it's certainly possible the subject could be in that field. However, the personality sketch doesn't mention anything specific to computer science like an interest in technology or programming. So while it's possible, I consider it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science based solely on the given information.
