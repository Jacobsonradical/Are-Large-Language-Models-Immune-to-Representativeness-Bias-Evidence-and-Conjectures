Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Problem solving skills and understanding abstract concepts are also applicable in this field.

While the subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving enjoyment and ability to grasp abstractions could fit well with computer science, overall the personality description seems to lean more towards an alignment with agricultural and veterinary pursuits. Of course, both estimates have some uncertainty without more specific information about Adam's interests and background.
