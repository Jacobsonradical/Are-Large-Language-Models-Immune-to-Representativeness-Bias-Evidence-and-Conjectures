Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking. This aligns more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. However, an aptitude for abstract concepts and puzzle-solving could also fit well with computer science, so I assigned that a moderate probability as well. The probabilities don't need to sum to 1 since they are independent estimates for each field based on the limited information provided.
