Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking and intelligence could also fit with this field.

While the intelligence, abstract thinking ability and puzzle-solving interest could indicate computer science, overall the sketch seems to more strongly point to agricultural and veterinary science based on the nature, plant and animal references. But computer science is certainly a possibility as well given the mental traits described.
