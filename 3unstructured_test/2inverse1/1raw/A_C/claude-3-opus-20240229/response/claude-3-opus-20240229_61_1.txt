Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature and plants, as well as their deep love for animals, suggests a higher probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Their ability to understand abstract concepts and solve puzzles could fit with computer science, but the overall description seems to lean more towards an interest in the natural world and living things.
