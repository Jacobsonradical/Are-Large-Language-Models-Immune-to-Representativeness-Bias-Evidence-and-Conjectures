Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone who would pursue agricultural and veterinary science. The affinity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree, but the overall profile seems more slanted towards agricultural and veterinary science based on the emphasis on nature, plants and animals in the personality sketch.
