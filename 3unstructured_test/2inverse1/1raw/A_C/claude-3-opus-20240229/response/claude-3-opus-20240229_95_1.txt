Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature and plants, as well as their deep love for animals, suggests a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of empathy and a warm heart also aligns well with the care and compassion often associated with veterinary professions.

While the subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be applicable to computer science, the personality sketch does not explicitly mention an interest in technology or programming. Problem-solving skills and dedication are valuable in both fields, but the overall description seems to lean more towards agricultural and veterinary science.
