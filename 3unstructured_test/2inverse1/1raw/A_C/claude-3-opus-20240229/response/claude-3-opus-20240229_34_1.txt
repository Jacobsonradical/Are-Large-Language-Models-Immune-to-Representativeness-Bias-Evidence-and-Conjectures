Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy, which seems more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, but overall the profile seems to lean more towards an interest in the natural world and veterinary medicine. Of course, these are just rough probabilistic estimates based on limited information.
