Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, which seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. Problem-solving skills and understanding abstract concepts could apply to both fields, but the other traits mentioned seem more directly relevant to agricultural and veterinary science, so I estimate a higher probability for that field compared to computer science.
