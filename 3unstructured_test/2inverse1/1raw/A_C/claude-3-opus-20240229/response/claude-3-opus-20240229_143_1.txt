Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have qualities and interests that align more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science, such as a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication which are important in these fields. His empathy and warm heart also seem well-suited for working with and caring for animals.

While Adam's intelligence, abstract thinking skills and enjoyment of puzzles could certainly lend themselves well to computer science, the sketch overall seems to paint a picture more consistent with someone drawn to agricultural and veterinary fields. But there is certainly some probability he could be studying computer science given his strong cognitive abilities.
