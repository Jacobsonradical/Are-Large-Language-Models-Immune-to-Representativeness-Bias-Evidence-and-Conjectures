Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as a deep love for animals, which aligns well with the agricultural and veterinary science field. Additionally, the mention of a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with the rigorous nature of veterinary studies.

The computer science probability is lower but still substantial, as the sketch mentions enjoying solving puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts, which are traits that could lend themselves well to computer science. The high intelligence mentioned is also a positive indicator for success in a challenging field like computer science.
