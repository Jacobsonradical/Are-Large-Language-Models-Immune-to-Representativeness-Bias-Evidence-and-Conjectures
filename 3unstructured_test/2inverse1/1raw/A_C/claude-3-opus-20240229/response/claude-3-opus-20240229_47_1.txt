Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, as well as a deep love for animals, which aligns more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science. However, the overall description seems to lean more towards an affinity for life sciences and nature rather than technology and computing. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, based on the given personality sketch.
