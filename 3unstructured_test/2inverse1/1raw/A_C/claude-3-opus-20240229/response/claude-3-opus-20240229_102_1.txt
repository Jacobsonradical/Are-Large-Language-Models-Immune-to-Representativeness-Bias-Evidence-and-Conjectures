Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love of nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts, as well as empathy and a warm heart. While aspects like curiosity, intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, overall the description seems to align more strongly with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The genuine interest in nature, plants and animals along with empathy and dedication are very consistent with that field of study. So I estimate a higher probability of 0.8 for agricultural and veterinary science compared to 0.6 for computer science based on the personality profile provided.
