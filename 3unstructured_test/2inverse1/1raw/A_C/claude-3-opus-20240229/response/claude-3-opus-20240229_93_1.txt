Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants and deep love for animals suggests a higher probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. The enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could fit with either field, but seems more directly applicable to computer science. However, computer science is less directly connected to the other traits and interests described. Therefore, I estimated a significantly higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science based on the personality sketch provided, while acknowledging the sketch is consistent with either field to some degree.
