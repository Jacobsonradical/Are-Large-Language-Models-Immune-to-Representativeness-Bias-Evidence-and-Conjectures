Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of study in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem to align well with agricultural and veterinary science. The probability is relatively high at 0.7.

While the sketch also mentions high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, which could fit with computer science, the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to computer science. Therefore, I estimate a lower but still substantial probability of 0.4 for computer science.
