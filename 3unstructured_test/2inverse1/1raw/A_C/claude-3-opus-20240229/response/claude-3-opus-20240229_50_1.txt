Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants and deep love for animals suggests a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. The puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are also compatible with computer science, but seem somewhat less probable given the emphasis on nature, plants and animals in the personality sketch.
