Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants and animals which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. Problem solving skills, intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are relevant to both fields, but the other details seem to point more towards agricultural and veterinary science rather than computer science for this particular individual. Of course, these are just rough probability estimates based on limited information.
