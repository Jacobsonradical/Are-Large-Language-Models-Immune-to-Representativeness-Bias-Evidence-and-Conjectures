Here is my estimate of the probabilities in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science than computer science, which is why I assigned a higher probability to that field. The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit either field. Problem solving skills are mentioned which is relevant to computer science, but overall the personality profile seems to fit agricultural and veterinary science a bit better in my estimation.
