Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions qualities like curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an understanding of hard work and dedication. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. Problem-solving skills and understanding abstract concepts could apply to both fields, but the overall profile seems to fit better with agricultural and veterinary science. That's why I assigned a higher probability estimate to that field.
