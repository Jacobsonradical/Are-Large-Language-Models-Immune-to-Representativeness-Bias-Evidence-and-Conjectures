Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Problem solving skills and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science, but the other traits seem more directly relevant to agricultural and veterinary science, so I assign a higher probability to that field for this personality profile.
