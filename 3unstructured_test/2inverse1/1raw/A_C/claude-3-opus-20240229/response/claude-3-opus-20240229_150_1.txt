Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem to align well with agricultural and veterinary science. The high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree, but overall the sketch seems to more strongly indicate an interest in agriculture, nature and animals. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
