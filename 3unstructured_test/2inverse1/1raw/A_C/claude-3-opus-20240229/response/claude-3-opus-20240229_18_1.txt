Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on the two fields of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The probability for this field is estimated to be relatively high at 0.7.

While the sketch also mentions an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and high intelligence, which could be relevant to computer science, the other traits seem less directly related to this field. Therefore, the probability for computer science is estimated to be lower at 0.4.
