Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.

While the sketch also mentions intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles, which could fit with computer science, overall the interests and traits seem to lean more towards agricultural and veterinary science. However, it's certainly possible Adam could be studying computer science with those other interests as well.
