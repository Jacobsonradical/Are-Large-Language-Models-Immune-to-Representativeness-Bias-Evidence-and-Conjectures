Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, which aligns well with interests typical of someone in agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could also fit with computer science, but the overall description seems to lean more towards agricultural and veterinary science based on the strong emphasis on nature and animals.
