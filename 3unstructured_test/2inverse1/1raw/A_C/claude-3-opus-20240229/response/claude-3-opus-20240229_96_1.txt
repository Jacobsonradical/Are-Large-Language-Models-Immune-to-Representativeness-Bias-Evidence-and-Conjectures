Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.

The sketch also mentions being good at understanding abstract concepts and having high intelligence, which could apply to either field. Problem solving skills are mentioned which are useful in computer science. 

Overall though, the emphasis on nature, plants, animals and dedication lead me to assign a higher probability to agricultural and veterinary science. Computer science is certainly possible given the intelligence and problem solving aspects, but seems less likely given the overall profile. That's why I estimated a 70% chance for agricultural/veterinary studies and a 40% chance for computer science based on the personality description provided.
