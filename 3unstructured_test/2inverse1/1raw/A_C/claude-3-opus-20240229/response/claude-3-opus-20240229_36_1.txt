Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on his field of study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, which seem more aligned with a field like agricultural and veterinary science than computer science. However, the sketch also mentions being good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, as well as high intelligence, which could fit well with computer science. So while I think agricultural and veterinary science is more likely given the personality description, I still assign a decent probability to computer science.
