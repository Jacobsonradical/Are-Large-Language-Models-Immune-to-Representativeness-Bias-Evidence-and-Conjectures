Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch indicates a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and a love for animals specifically. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

The sketch also mentions high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles. While these traits could apply to many fields, they do suggest an aptitude for a quantitative, analytical field like computer science.

However, the overall emphasis on nature, plants and animals leads me to assign a higher probability to agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science for this particular personality sketch. The probabilities don't need to add to 1 since they are considered independently.
