Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants and animals, as well as empathy, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. Problem solving skills and understanding abstract concepts could fit with either field, but the overall description seems to lean more towards agricultural and veterinary science rather than computer science, in my estimation.
