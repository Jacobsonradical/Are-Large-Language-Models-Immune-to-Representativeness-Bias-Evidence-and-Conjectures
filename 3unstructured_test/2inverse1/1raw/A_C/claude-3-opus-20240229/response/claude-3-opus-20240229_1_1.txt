Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love of nature, plants and animals, as well as empathy, which seem to align well with agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence, problem-solving skills and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with either field, but the other details make me think agricultural and veterinary science is more likely, with a probability around 0.7.

The skills could also apply to computer science to some degree, especially the puzzle-solving, intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts. But overall the sketch seems to fit less well with computer science, so I estimate a lower probability of around 0.3 for that field. The probabilities don't need to add to 1 since there could be other possible fields not listed.
