Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who loves nature, plants and animals, has strong empathy, and appreciates hard work and dedication. This aligns more closely with a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. 

The mention of curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication all point more towards agricultural and veterinary science. While the subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles could certainly apply to a computer science student, those traits are less uniquely indicative of that field compared to the other mentioned attributes. 

Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of around 0.7 that this describes an agricultural and veterinary science graduate student, and a lower but still significant probability of around 0.4 that it could describe a computer science student. The probabilities don't need to add to 1 since graduate programs in other fields are also possible given this personality sketch.
