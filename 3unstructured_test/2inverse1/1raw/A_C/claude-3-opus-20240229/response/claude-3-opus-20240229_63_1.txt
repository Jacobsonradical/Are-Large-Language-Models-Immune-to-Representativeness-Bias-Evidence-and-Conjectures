Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest a higher probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills are also relevant to computer science, but the overall description seems more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.
