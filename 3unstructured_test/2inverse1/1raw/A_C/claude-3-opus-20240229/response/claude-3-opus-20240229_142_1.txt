Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on his enrollment in each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. However, the sketch also mentions an aptitude for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and an ability to understand abstract concepts, which could fit with a computer science student as well. So while I believe agricultural and veterinary science is more likely given the details provided, I wouldn't rule out computer science entirely.
