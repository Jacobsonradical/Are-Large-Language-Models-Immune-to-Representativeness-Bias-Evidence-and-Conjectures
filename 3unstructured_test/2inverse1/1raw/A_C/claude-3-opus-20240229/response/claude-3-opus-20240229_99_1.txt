Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of being good at understanding abstract concepts could fit with either field. Overall, the traits seem to fit agricultural and veterinary science a bit better, so I assigned a higher probability to that field, but computer science is also a possibility given the mention of intelligence and abstract thinking.
