Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. Problem solving skills and understanding abstract concepts could fit either field, but seem slightly more applicable to computer science. Overall, I estimate a higher probability the sketch is about an agricultural/veterinary science student, but it could potentially describe a computer science student as well.
