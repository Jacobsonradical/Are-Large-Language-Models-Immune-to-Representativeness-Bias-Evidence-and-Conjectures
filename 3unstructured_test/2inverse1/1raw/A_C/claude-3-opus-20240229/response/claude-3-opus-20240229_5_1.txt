Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and enjoying solving puzzles. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.

However, the sketch also mentions high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could apply to many fields including computer science. So while I think agricultural and veterinary science is more probable given the personality description, I still assign a fairly high 0.6 probability to computer science.
