Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem to align well with agricultural and veterinary science. The traits of being good at understanding abstract concepts and having high intelligence could fit with computer science, but overall the personality seems more suited to agricultural and veterinary science based on the details provided.
