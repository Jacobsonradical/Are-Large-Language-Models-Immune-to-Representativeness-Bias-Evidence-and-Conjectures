Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

The personality sketch mentions a strong interest in nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, which aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. Problem-solving skills and understanding abstract concepts are also valuable in computer science, but the overall description seems to fit better with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.
