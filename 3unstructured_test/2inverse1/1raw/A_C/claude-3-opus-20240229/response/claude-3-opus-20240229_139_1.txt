Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a curious, analytical mind who enjoys problem-solving, which could fit well with computer science. However, the strong emphasis on a love of nature, plants, animals, and empathy suggests an even stronger fit with agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking ability and dedication appreciation are applicable to both fields. So while computer science is a reasonable probability, I estimate a higher likelihood that this personality sketch describes a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
