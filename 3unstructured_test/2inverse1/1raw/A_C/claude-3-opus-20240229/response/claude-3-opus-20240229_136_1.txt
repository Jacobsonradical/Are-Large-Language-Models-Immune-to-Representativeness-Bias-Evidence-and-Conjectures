Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, which aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. Problem-solving skills and understanding abstract concepts could apply to both fields, but the overall description seems to fit better with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. Computer science is certainly possible given the high intelligence and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, but the other traits mentioned seem more indicative of an agricultural/veterinary path.
