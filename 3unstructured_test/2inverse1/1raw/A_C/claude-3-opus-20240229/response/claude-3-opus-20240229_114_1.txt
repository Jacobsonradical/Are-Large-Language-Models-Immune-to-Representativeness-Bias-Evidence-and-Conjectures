Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, which I believe aligns more closely with a student in agricultural and veterinary science. The sketch also mentions being good at understanding abstract concepts and having high intelligence, which could fit with computer science. However, overall the personality traits seem to fit better with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.
