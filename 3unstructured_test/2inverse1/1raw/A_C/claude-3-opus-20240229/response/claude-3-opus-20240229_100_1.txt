Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, as well as a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem quite well-aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The sketch also mentions being good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoying solving puzzles, which could fit with computer science. However, the overall description seems to lean more towards an interest in nature, plants and animals.

Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information. The individual could certainly have interests and abilities in both areas.
