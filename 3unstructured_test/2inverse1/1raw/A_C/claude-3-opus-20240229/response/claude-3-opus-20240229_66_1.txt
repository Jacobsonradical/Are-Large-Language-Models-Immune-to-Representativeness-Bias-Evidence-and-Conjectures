Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a higher likelihood of studying agricultural and veterinary science. The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts also fit with computer science to some degree. However, the overall description seems more aligned with an interest in the natural world and animals specifically.
