Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, which I believe aligns more closely with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, the sketch also mentions enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, which are qualities that could fit well with a computer science student. So while I think agricultural and veterinary science is more likely given the overall profile, I still think there is a fairly good chance the sketch could be of a computer science student like Adam.
