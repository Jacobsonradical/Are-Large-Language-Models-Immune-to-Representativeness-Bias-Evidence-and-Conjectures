Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love for animals, an understanding of nature and plants, as well as empathy, which I think aligns well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science, but overall the personality traits seem to be a stronger match for agricultural and veterinary science, in my estimation.
