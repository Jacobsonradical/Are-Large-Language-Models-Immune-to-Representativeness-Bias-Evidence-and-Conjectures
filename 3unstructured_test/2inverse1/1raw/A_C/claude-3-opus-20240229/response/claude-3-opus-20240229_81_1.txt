Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a love for problem-solving and abstract concepts. These traits align more closely with a student in agricultural and veterinary science than computer science.

However, the mention of high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and an understanding of abstract concepts also suggests that this person could potentially be a good fit for computer science. Therefore, I've assigned a lower but still significant probability to computer science.
