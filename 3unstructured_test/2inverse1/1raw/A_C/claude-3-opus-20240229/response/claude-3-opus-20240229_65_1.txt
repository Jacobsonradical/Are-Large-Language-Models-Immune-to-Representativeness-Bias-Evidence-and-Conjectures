Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, plants and animals, as well as empathy and love for animals. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. 

At the same time, the sketch mentions an aptitude for abstract concepts, puzzles and high intelligence. While this could apply to many fields, it has some overlap with skills useful in computer science.

So while both fields are possible, the overall description seems to me more probable for someone in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. But there is certainly a non-trivial probability it could describe a computer science student as well.
