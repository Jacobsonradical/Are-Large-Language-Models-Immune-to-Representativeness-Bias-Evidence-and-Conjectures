Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an understanding of abstract concepts. While the abstract thinking could fit with computer science, the other traits seem to align more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. So I estimate a higher probability of 0.8 that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science based on the personality description, and a lower but still substantial 0.6 probability for computer science.
