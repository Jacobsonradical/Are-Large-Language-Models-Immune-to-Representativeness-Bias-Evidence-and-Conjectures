Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each of the fields, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. However, the sketch also mentions an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, which could fit with computer science as well. Without more specific information, it's difficult to assign a very high probability to either field, but agricultural and veterinary science seems somewhat more likely given the details provided.
