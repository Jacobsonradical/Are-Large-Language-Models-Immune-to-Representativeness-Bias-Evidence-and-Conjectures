Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem to align well with agricultural and veterinary science. However, the sketch also mentions an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, which could fit with computer science. So while I think agricultural and veterinary science is more likely given the personality description, I wouldn't rule out computer science entirely.
