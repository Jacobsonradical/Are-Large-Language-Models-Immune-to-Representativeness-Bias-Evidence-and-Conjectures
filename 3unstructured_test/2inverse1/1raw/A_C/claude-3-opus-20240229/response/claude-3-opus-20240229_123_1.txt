Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals suggests a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of being good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles is also consistent with computer science. However, the overall profile seems to align more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science pursuits.
