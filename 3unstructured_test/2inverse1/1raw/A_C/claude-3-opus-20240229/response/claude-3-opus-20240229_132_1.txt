Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and empathy, which seem more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than computer science. Problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts could apply to both fields. Overall, the description feels more fitting for someone studying agricultural and veterinary science, so I assigned a higher probability to that field, but there is still a reasonable chance Adam could be studying computer science with those traits as well.
