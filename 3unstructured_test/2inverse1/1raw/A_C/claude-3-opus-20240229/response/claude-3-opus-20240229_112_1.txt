Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, animals, and hard work, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of high intelligence, abstract thinking and puzzle-solving skills also suggests possible aptitude for computer science. However, the overall description seems to fit agricultural and veterinary science a bit more strongly in my estimation.
