Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of puzzle-solving could fit well with either computer science or agricultural/veterinary science. However, the specific mention of a deep love for animals and curiosity about plants suggests a somewhat higher probability of the sketch being about someone in agricultural and veterinary science. The abstract thinking and intelligence mentioned could apply to both fields. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
