Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and a love for animals. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

The sketch also mentions high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles. While these traits could apply to computer science as well, they are less specific to that field compared to the nature and animal-related traits for agricultural and veterinary science. So I assigned a lower, but still substantial, probability to computer science.
