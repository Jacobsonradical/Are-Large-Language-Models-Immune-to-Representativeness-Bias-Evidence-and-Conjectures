Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants and animals. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The sketch also mentions intelligence, abstract thinking and puzzle-solving skills, which could fit well with computer science. However, the overall profile seems to lean more towards agricultural and veterinary science given the repeated mentions of curiosity about nature, plants and love of animals. Computer science is certainly a possibility but I assess a higher probability of this profile matching someone in agricultural and veterinary science.
