Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, which I believe aligns more closely with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. The sketch also mentions being good at understanding abstract concepts and having high intelligence, which could apply to both fields. However, the overall description seems to fit better with an agricultural and veterinary science student. Of course, this is just an estimate based on limited information.
