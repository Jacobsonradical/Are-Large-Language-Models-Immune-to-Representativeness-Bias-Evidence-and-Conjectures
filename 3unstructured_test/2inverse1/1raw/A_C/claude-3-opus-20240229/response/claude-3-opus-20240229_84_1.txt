Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on the two fields of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love of nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. Problem-solving skills and understanding abstract concepts could apply to both fields, but the other traits mentioned seem to fit more with agricultural and veterinary science, so I estimate a higher probability for that field.
