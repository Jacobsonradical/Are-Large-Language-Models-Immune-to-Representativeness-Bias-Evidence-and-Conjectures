Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, animals, and a warm and empathetic personality, which I think aligns more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of being good at understanding abstract concepts and high intelligence could fit with computer science as well. However, the overall profile seems to lean more towards someone well-suited for working with nature and animals, so I assigned a higher probability to agricultural and veterinary science.
