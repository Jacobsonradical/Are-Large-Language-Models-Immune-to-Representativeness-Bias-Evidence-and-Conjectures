Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, along with a strong work ethic, seem to align well with agricultural and veterinary science. The traits of high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles could fit with computer science to some degree, but overall the personality description seems more suited to agricultural and veterinary pursuits.
