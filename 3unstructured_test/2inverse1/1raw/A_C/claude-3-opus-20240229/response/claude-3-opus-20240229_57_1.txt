Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a higher likelihood of studying agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of empathy and a warm heart also fits well with a field focused on animal care.

While the subject's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could lend itself well to computer science, the personality sketch overall seems more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. However, there is still a reasonable probability that the subject could be pursuing computer science.
