Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and hard work, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree, but the overall description seems to lean more towards an agricultural/veterinary field based on the emphasis on nature, plants, animals and empathy.
