Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. Problem solving skills and understanding abstract concepts could apply to both fields, but the other details make me think it is more likely Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science based on this limited information.
