Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and abstract thinking. This aligns more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science than computer science, though aspects like curiosity, intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could fit with either field. Without more specific information, agricultural and veterinary science seems a more likely match overall based on the personality description provided.
