Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts also fits with computer science to some degree, but I believe the overall description points more strongly to agricultural and veterinary science as a likely field of study for this individual.
