Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, animals, and hard work, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. While the intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving aspects could fit with computer science, overall the description seems to lean more towards an agricultural/veterinary focus based on the specific traits and interests highlighted.
