Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on the two fields of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a higher likelihood that Adam is studying agricultural and veterinary science. However, the traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could also fit with computer science, so I assign a moderate probability to that field as well.
