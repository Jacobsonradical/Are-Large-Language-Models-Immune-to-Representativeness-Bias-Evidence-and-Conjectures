Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given his enrollment in each respective field in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The traits of enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree, but seem more secondary compared to the emphasis on nature, animals and dedication which point more towards agricultural and veterinary pursuits.
