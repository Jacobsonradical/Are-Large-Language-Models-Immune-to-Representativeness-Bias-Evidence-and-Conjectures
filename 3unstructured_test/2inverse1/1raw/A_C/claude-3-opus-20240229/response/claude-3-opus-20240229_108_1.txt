Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love of nature, plants, animals, and a warm, empathetic heart, which I believe aligns more strongly with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. However, the mention of high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles also fits the profile of many computer science students, so I assigned a moderate probability to that field as well. Overall, I think the personality is more likely to match someone in agricultural and veterinary science, but it could potentially fit a computer science student too.
