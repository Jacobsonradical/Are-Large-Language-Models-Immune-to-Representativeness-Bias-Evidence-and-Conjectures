Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants and deep love for animals, along with a strong work ethic, seem to align well with agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also fit relatively well with computer science. However, the overall profile seems to lean more towards agricultural and veterinary science based on the emphasis on nature, plants and animals in the personality sketch.
