Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. However, the traits of enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit well with computer science. So while I think agricultural and veterinary science is more likely given the personality description, I still assign a fairly high probability to computer science.
