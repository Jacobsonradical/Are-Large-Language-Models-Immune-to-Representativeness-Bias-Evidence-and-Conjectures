Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on his enrollment in each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a curiosity about nature, plants, and a love for animals, which aligns well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could also fit with computer science, but the overall description seems to lean more towards an interest in the natural world and animals. Therefore, I assigned a higher probability to agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
