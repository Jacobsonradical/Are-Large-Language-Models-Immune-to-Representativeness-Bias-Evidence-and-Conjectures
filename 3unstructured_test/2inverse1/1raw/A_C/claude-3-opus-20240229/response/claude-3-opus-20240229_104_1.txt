Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align more strongly with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. However, the traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts also fit well with a computer science student. So while both fields are plausible given the personality description, I assigned a somewhat higher probability to agricultural and veterinary science.
