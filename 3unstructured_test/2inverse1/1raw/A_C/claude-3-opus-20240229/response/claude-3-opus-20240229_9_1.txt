Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree, but seem less directly relevant than for agricultural and veterinary science based on the sketch provided.
