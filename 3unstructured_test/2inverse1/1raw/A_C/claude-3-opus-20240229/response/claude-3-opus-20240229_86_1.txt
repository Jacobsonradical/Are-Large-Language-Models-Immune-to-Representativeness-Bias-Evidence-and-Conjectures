Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone pursuing agricultural and veterinary science. The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree, but seem less directly relevant than for agricultural and veterinary science based on the personality sketch provided.
