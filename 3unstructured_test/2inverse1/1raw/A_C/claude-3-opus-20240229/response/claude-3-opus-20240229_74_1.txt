Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, which I believe align more closely with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The sketch also mentions being good at understanding abstract concepts and having high intelligence, which could fit with computer science. However, the overall description seems to fit agricultural and veterinary science a bit better in my estimation, so I assigned a higher probability to that field.
