Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which seem to align well with agricultural and veterinary science. However, being good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoying solving puzzles could also fit with computer science. So while I think agricultural and veterinary science is more likely given the details provided, I wouldn't rule out computer science entirely.
