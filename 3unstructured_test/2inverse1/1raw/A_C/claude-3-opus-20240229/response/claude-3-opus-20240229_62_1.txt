Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of being good at understanding abstract concepts could also fit with this field.

While the traits of enjoying solving puzzles and having high intelligence could certainly apply to someone in computer science, overall the personality sketch seems to more strongly match someone in agricultural and veterinary science. However, there is still a reasonable probability that it could describe a computer science student, so I estimated that at 0.4.
