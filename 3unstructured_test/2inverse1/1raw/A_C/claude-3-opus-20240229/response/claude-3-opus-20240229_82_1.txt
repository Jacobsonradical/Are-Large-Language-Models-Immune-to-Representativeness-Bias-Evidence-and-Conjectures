Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on his field of study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love for animals, an appreciation of nature and plants, as well as empathy and a warm heart. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The sketch also mentions intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles. While these traits could apply to computer science as well, overall the description seems to fit agricultural and veterinary science better. Of course, additional information about Adam's specific interests and background would help refine the estimate further.
