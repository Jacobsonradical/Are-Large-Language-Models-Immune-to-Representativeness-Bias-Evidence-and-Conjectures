Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of curiosity, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science, but overall the sketch seems to more strongly indicate an interest in life sciences and the natural world.
