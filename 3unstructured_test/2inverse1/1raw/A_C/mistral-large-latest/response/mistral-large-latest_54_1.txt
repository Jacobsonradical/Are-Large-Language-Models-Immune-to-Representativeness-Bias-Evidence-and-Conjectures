  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Explanation:
- "Computer Science": Adam's affinity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with the problem-solving and analytical skills required in computer science. However, the sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals is less typical for computer science students, hence a probability of 0.6.
- "Agricultural and Veterinary Science": The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy strongly suggest a good fit with agricultural and veterinary sciences. The high intelligence and appreciation for hard work also support success in these fields, hence a higher probability of 0.8.
