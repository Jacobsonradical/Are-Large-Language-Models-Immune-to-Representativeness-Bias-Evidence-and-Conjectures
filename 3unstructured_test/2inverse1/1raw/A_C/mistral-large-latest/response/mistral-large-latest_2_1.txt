Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.45
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field. Therefore, the probability is relatively high.
- **Computer Science**: While the subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could fit well with computer science, the sketch's emphasis on nature and animals suggests a lower probability compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
