Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills needed in computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes his love for nature, animals, and empathy, which are not as directly related to computer science.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication make him a strong fit for agricultural and veterinary science. These traits are highly relevant to the field.

Given these factors, the probability is higher for agricultural and veterinary science, but computer science is also a plausible fit.
