```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills needed in computer science. However, the strong emphasis on nature, plants, and animals suggests this might not be the primary field of interest.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication make this field a very strong fit. The sketch seems to align more closely with the interests and values associated with agricultural and veterinary science.
