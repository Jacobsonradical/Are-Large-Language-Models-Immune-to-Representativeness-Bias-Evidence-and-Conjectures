{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the agricultural and veterinary science field, hence the higher probability.
- While the subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts could indicate a fit for computer science, the personality sketch does not highlight any specific interest or skills related to technology. Therefore, the probability for computer science is lower but still possible.
