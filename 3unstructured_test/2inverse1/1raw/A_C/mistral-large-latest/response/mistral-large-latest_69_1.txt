Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, hence the higher probability.
- **Computer Science**: While the subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit this field, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy makes it less likely, hence the lower probability.
