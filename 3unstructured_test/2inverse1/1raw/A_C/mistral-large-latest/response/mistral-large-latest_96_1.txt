Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field. Additionally, the appreciation for hard work and dedication is a common trait in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
- **Computer Science**: While the subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are relevant to computer science, the emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy suggests a stronger fit with agricultural and veterinary science. However, the interest in solving puzzles could also be relevant to computer science, hence a non-zero probability.
