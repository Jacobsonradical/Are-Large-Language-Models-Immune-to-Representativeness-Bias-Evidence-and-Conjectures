{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}

Explanation:
- "Computer Science": The subject's strong problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the requirements of computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals does not strongly indicate a focus on computer science. Hence, a probability of 0.6 is assigned.
- "Agricultural and Veterinary Science": The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align very well with the fields of agricultural and veterinary science. The appreciation for hard work and dedication is also relevant to these fields. Therefore, a higher probability of 0.75 is assigned.
