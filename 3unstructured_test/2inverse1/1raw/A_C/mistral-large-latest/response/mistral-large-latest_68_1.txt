Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field. Additionally, the appreciation for hard work and dedication is a common trait in agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the probability is higher.
- **Computer Science**: While the subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could be relevant to computer science, the emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy suggests a lower probability compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
