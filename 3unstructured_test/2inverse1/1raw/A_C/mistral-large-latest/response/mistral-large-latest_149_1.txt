{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Explanation:
- "Computer Science": The subject's strong problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a good fit for computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals is less typical of computer science students. Hence, a probability of 0.6 is estimated.
- "Agricultural and Veterinary Science": The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align very well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. The appreciation for hard work and dedication is also fitting. Thus, a higher probability of 0.8 is estimated.
