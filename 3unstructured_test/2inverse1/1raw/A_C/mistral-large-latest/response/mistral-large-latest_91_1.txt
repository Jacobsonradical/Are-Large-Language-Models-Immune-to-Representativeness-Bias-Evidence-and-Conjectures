Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field. Therefore, the probability is higher.
- **Computer Science**: While the subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could fit this field, the emphasis on nature and animals in the sketch makes it less likely. Hence, the probability is lower but still notable.
