{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests an aptitude for computer science. However, the personality sketch does not mention any explicit interest in technology or computers, hence a probability of 0.4.
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy are more directly aligned with agricultural and veterinary sciences. Therefore, a higher probability of 0.6 is assigned to this field.
