{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Explanation:
- "Computer Science": Adam's traits such as high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills needed for computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals is less typical of computer science students. Hence, a probability of 0.6 is assigned.
- "Agricultural and Veterinary Science": The personality sketch strongly highlights Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, which are all highly relevant to agricultural and veterinary sciences. Therefore, a higher probability of 0.8 is assigned.
