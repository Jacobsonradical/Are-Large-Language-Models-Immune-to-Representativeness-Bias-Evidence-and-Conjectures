  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}

Explanation:
- The subject's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align with skills often found in computer science students. However, the personality sketch does not mention any explicit interest in technology or computers, hence the probability of 0.6.
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy are more directly aligned with agricultural and veterinary sciences. Therefore, the probability is higher at 0.75.
