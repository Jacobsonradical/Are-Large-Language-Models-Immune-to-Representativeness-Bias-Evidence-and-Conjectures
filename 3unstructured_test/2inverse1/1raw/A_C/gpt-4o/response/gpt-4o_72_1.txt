Based on the provided personality sketch, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is highly plausible that he would be studying in this field. This field aligns well with his interests and characteristics.
  
- **Computer Science**: While Adam's intelligence and skill in understanding abstract concepts are a good fit for computer science, the personality sketch emphasizes a more nature-oriented and empathetic disposition, which is less directly aligned with the typical focus of computer science. Therefore, the probability is lower, though still significant due to his high intelligence and puzzle-solving enjoyment.
