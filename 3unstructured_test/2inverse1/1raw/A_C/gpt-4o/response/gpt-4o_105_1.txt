Given the information provided, here's my estimation of the probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align closely with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science, which often focuses on the study and care of plants and animals.
  
- **Computer Science**: The subject enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, but there's less direct alignment with the specific interest in nature, plants, and animals. Thus, while it's possible, it's less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
