Based on the given personality sketch, the following probabilities are estimated:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

The reasoning behind these estimates is that Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles also lend themselves to a field like computer science. Therefore, while it is more likely that Adam would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, there is still a reasonable possibility that he could be involved in computer science.
