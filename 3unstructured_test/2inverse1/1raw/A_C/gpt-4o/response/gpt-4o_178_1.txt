Explanation: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, combined with his warm heart and empathy, it seems highly probable that he might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, which aligns with his interests and personality traits. The probability for this field is set relatively high at 0.8.

On the other hand, while Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are traits beneficial for computer science, his deep love for nature and animals makes this field somewhat less likely. However, it remains a possibility because of his strong abstract thinking skills. Hence, the probability for computer science is set at a moderate value of 0.5.
