Based on the provided personality sketch and considering Adam's characteristics, here is my estimate of the probability that the sketch was about Adam if he was enrolled in each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Given his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, Adam's personality aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. Meanwhile, his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be relevant to computer science, but the personality traits described seem to strongly resonate with the former field.
