Sure, here is my estimation based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

The subject's strong understanding and love for nature, plants, and animals makes agricultural and veterinary science a more likely fit. However, his high intelligence, curiosity, and ability to understand abstract concepts could also make him a good fit for computer science, thus it is not ruled out.
