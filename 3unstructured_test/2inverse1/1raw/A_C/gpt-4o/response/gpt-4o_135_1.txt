  "computer science": 0.5
}

Explanation:
- "Agricultural and veterinary science": Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it is highly plausible that he would be drawn to a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the probability is estimated to be quite high.
- "Computer science": While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are traits beneficial for computer science, the personality sketch does not strongly emphasize interests typically associated with computer science (e.g., programming, technology). Hence, the probability is moderate but not as high as for agricultural and veterinary science.
