Sure, based on the provided personality sketch, here are my estimates for the probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

These probabilities take into account Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and skill in understanding abstract concepts also suit well for a field like computer science, although his specific interests might make him more likely to be in the former field.
