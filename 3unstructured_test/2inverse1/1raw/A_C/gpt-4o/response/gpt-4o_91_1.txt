Here's my best estimate of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

The personality sketch describes someone with a deep appreciation for nature, plants, and animals, which aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. However, the high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts also slightly hint toward a possible background in computer science, hence the given probabilities.
