Given the information provided in the personality sketch and Adam's characteristics, we can compare how well these traits align with the fields of computer science and agricultural and veterinary science.

For computer science:
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, with a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are traits commonly associated with success in computer science.
- However, his deep love for animals and strong empathy might not be directly related to this field.

For agricultural and veterinary science:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, which are direct indicators of an interest in agricultural and veterinary science.
- His strong empathy and warm heart also align well with this field, as it requires a dedication to animal welfare and environmental stewardship.

Given this analysis, the probabilities could be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,  // Alignment with problem-solving and abstract thinking
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7  // Strong alignment with nature, animals, and empathy
}
