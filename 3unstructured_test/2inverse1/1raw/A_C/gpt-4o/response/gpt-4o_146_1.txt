Based on the personality sketch provided, it seems that Adam has interests and traits that align more with fields that involve a deep appreciation for nature, animals, and potentially the environment. Here is the estimated probability for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in a field like agricultural and veterinary science. However, his intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts also fit well with computer science, albeit to a lesser degree given the emphasis on nature and animals in the sketch.
