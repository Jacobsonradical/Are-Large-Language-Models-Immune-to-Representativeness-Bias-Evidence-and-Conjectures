Given Adam's traits, let's examine the probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - His deep love for animals.
   - Strong empathy and warm heart.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

   These characteristics strongly align with a field that involves nature, plants, and animals, making agricultural and veterinary science a strong match.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles.

   While Adam's problem-solving skills and intelligence could fit computer science, the personality sketch puts notable emphasis on nature, plants, and animals, which are less directly related to computer science.

Based on this analysis, here are the probability estimates:
