Sure, based on the personality sketch provided, here are my estimates for the probability that it was about Adam, if Adam was enrolled in each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high intelligence, it seems more likely that he would be involved in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. While his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts could also make computer science a possibility, the emphasis on nature and animals tips the balance toward agricultural and veterinary science.
