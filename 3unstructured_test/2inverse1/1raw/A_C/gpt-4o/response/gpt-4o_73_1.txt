Sure, here are the estimates based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

The subject's deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, and strong empathy make it highly likely that they are enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. However, the high intelligence, capability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also align well with a field like computer science, though it is somewhat less likely given the personality sketch.
