Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, his empathy, and his appreciation for hard work, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in a field that aligns with these interests. While he also shows high intelligence and an aptitude for abstract concepts, traits which are beneficial in computer science, they don't point as strongly towards that field as his other characteristics fit with agricultural and veterinary science.

Here's my best estimate of the probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
