Based on the personality sketch, here's the estimated probability for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. The interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence are also traits that could fit well within computer science, but the overall personality sketch seems more tailored to the former field.
