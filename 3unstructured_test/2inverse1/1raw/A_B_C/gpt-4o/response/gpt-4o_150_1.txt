Given the information provided in the personality sketch, the probabilities can be estimated as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns well with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his deep love for animals. These characteristics suggest a strong fit.
- **Computer Science**: While computer science often involves solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which Adam is good at, his empathy and love for animals suggest he might be more inclined towards a field that involves direct interaction with nature and living beings.
- **Business Administration**: This field typically does not directly relate to nature, plants, or animals and is less likely to appeal to Adam's stated interests and values.
