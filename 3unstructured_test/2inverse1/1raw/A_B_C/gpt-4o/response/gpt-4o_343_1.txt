Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Given Adam's deep love for nature, animals, and empathy, business administration seems less aligned with his personality and interests. Thus, a lower probability of 0.1.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns very well with Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals, suggesting a high probability of 0.7.
- **Computer Science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, his interest in nature and animals makes this field moderately likely with a probability of 0.2.
