**Explanation:**

**Business Administration:** This field typically requires an interest in management, economics, and business operations. Adam's deep love for nature, animals, and his empathy suggest that he might not be as inclined toward a field focused primarily on business aspects. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.

**Computer Science:** Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills needed in computer science. His enjoyment of solving puzzles and quiet nature can also be a fit. However, his strong empathy and love for animals and nature might make him favor other fields more directly aligned with these interests, leading to a moderate probability.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** This field seems to be the best fit for Adam given his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. His empathy and warm heart also align well with the caring nature of this field, making this the most probable field for Adam.
