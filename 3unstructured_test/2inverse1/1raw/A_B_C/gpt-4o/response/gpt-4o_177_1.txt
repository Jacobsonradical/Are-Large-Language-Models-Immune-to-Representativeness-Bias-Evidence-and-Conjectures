Sure, based on the details of the personality sketch, I would evaluate the probabilities for each field as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

Here's the rationale:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The subject's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, along with a deep love for animals, aligns strongly with this field. The personality traits of empathy and appreciation for hard work also fit well. Therefore, this field has the highest probability.

- **Business Administration:** This field does not strongly align with the subject's interests in nature, animals, and solving puzzles. While empathy and a warm heart can be valuable in business, they are not as directly relevant as they are in agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, this has the lowest probability.

- **Computer Science:** While the subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence align with the field of computer science, the curiosity about nature and love for animals do not. Therefore, the probability is moderate.

These estimates are subjective evaluations based on the provided personality sketch.
