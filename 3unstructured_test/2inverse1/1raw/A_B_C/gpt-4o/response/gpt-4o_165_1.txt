Explanation:
- **Business administration**: While the subject's curiosity about nature and warm heart might be beneficial in business administration (especially in fields like sustainable business or human resources), it's not a field that directly aligns with his primary interests and personality traits as described.
- **Computer science**: The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence fit well with computer science, as the field requires strong problem-solving skills and a good grasp of abstract concepts. However, his deep love for animals and nature suggests that this may not be his first choice.
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given the subject's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, agricultural and veterinary science seems to be the best fit. This field directly aligns with his interests and personality traits.
