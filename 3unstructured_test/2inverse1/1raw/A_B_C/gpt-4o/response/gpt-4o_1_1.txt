Based on the personality sketch provided, here's the probability estimate for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, coupled with his strong empathy and understanding of hard work, makes agricultural and veterinary science a more likely field for him. His interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests there is some probability he could be studying computer science. However, based on the personality traits described, business administration appears to be the least likely field of study for Adam.
