Here's a brief explanation for each probability:

- **Computer Science (0.4):** While Adam's strong intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are traits that align well with computer science, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and warm heart, are less commonly highlighted in this field.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.9):** This field matches Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his love for animals very well. His empathy and warmth would also be well-suited for working with animals, and his appreciation for hard work aligns with the dedication required in this field.

- **Business Administration (0.2):** Although Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication could be beneficial in business administration, his specific interests in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his personality traits related to empathy and quiet introspection, align less closely with this field.
