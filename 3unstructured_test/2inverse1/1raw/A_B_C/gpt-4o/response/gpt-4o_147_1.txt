Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Explanation:

- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, making it the most likely field.
- The subject's high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles could also point towards computer science, but it is less directly connected to his interests in nature and animals.
- Business administration seems the least likely, given the subject's interests and personality traits, which are more aligned with fields involving nature, animals, and problem-solving in technical or scientific contexts.
