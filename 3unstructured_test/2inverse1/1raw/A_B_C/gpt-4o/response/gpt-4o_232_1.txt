Explanation:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adamâ€™s strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals coupled with his empathy and appreciation for hard work aligns very well with this field. Thus, there's a higher probability that the personality sketch describes someone in this area.

- **Computer Science**: While not directly related to nature and animals, Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science. Therefore, there's still a moderate probability.

- **Business Administration**: Although Adam might appreciate the hard work and dedication associated with any field, the described personal interests and traits such as empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not strongly align with a stereotypical business administration student. Hence, the probability is lower.
