Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, this field appears to be a highly probable match for his personality and interests.
- **Business administration**: Although business administration could involve solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, it seems less aligned with Adamâ€™s strong empathy for animals and curiosity about nature.
- **Computer science**: While Adam's high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills fit well with computer science, the deeper interest in nature, plants, and animals makes this field a possible but less likely match than agricultural and veterinary science.
