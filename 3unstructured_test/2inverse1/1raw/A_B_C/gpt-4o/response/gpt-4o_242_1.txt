  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Reasoning:
- The curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication align very well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.
- The intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles could relate to computer science, but the specific interests in nature and animals make this somewhat less likely.
- The characteristics described do not align strongly with typical stereotypes of business administration students, making it the least likely of the three fields.
