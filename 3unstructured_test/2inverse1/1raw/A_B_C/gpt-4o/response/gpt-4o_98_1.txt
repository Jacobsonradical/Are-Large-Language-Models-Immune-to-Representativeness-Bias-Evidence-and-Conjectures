Sure, based on the personality sketch provided, here are my estimates for the probability that the sketch describes Adam if he were enrolled in each of the specified fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These probabilities reflect my judgment considering Adam's strong interest in nature and animals, his intelligence, and his empathy. My rationale is that agricultural and veterinary science aligns closely with his love for plants and animals, computer science aligns with his intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, and business administration seems less likely considering it does not directly relate to his noted interests and traits.
