Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

These estimates are based on the described traits such as a strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and a good understanding of abstract concepts, which align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. However, his intelligence and appreciation for abstract concepts could also fit computer science to some extent. Business administration seems less likely given the described interests and traits.
