Based on the personality sketch, we can assess the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in various fields. The sketch highlights Adam's curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, intelligence, and empathy. Given this, here are the estimates:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The probability is relatively low (0.1) since there is no specific mention of interests or skills associated with the business field in the personality sketch.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The probability is high (0.8) because Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals aligns well with this field.
- **Computer Science**: The probability is moderate (0.5) because Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, although his affinity for nature and animals is not directly related to this field.
