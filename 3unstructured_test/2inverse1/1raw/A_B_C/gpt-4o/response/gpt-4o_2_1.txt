Given Adam's personality traits and interests, especially his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and strong empathy, here are my best estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

- **Business Administration**: The probability is relatively low because this field typically doesn't align closely with a passion for nature, animals, and the high degree of empathy described.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The probability is quite high because this field directly aligns with Adam's love for nature and animals, as well as an appreciation for hard work and dedication.
- **Computer Science**: This field has a moderate probability. While the problem-solving aspect and high intelligence fit well, the love for nature and animals are not necessarily aligned with the common focuses within computer science.
