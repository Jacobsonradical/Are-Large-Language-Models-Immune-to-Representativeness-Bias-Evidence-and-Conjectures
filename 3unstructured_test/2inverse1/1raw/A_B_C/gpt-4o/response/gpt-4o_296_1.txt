Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

The high probability for agricultural and veterinary science is due to Adam's strong curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals, which align well with this field. The other fields are less likely but still possible, especially considering his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, which can be relevant to computer science. Business administration seems less likely given his empathetic and quiet nature.
