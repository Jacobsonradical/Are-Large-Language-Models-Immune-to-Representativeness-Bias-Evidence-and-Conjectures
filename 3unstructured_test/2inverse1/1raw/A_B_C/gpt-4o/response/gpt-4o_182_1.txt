Sure, based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

The higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science is due to Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his deep love for animals. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also lend themselves well to computer science, although it aligns slightly less with his described interests. Business administration seems less likely given his natural inclinations and interests described in the sketch.
