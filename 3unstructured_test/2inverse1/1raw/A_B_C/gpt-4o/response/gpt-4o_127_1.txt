Sure, based on the personality sketch provided, here are the probabilities that the field of study relates to Adam:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Explanation:
- The strong love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as the empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication, align more closely with fields related to agriculture and veterinary science.
- The high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could relate to computer science, but the personality sketch does not specifically mention an interest in technology or computing, hence a moderate probability.
- The traits described do not particularly align with business administration, which typically values strategic thinking, finance, and management skills over an empathy and nature-focused perspective, resulting in a lower probability.
