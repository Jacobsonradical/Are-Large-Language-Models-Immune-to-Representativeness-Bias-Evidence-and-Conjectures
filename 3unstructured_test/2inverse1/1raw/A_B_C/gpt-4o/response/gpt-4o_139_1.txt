Given Adam's described curiosity about nature, plants, and his love for animals, agricultural and veterinary science has the highest probability. Computer science is also quite high due to his enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence, suggesting he may appreciate the abstract concepts found in this field. Business administration is the lowest probability because it generally does not align as closely with the interests and characteristics described in the personality sketch.
