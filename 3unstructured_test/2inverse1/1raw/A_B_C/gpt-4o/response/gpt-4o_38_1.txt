Explanation:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The personality sketch aligns strongly with an interest in nature, plants, and animals, which fits well with this field. Hence, a higher probability.

- **Business Administration:** The sketch does not particularly suggest an inclination towards business-related activities, making it less likely, but not impossible, that Adam is in this field. Thus, a low probability.

- **Computer Science:** The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence suggest that computer science is also a plausible field due to the abstract thinking and problem-solving nature of the discipline. Therefore, a moderate probability.
