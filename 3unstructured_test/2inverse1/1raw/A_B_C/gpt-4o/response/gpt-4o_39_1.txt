Explanation:

- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Given Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, it is quite likely he could be in a field such as computer science. The quiet nature and interest in puzzles support this as well. However, his deep love for nature and animals slightly lowers this probability compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with typical business administration traits, which often focus more on leadership, management, and human-centric skills rather than empathy towards animals, nature, and puzzles. Thus, this is less likely.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8)**: This field seems most likely given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits closely match the interests and attributes often associated with people in this field.
