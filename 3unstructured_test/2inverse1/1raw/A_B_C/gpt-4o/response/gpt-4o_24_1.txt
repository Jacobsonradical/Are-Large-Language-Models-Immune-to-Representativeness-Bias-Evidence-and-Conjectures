Based on the personality sketch provided and Adam's expressed interests and traits, here is the estimated probability for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.1
}

These estimates reflect Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals, which align most closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could certainly be applicable to computer science and business administration, but the described personality traits suggest a stronger fit with the former.
