Explanation:
- "business administration": Given Adam's deep love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, it's less likely he would be in a field focused on business and management, which is why the probability is relatively low.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Adam's curiosity about nature and various plants, along with his strong empathy and love for animals, aligns very well with this field, making it the most probable.
- "computer science": While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are important in computer science, his inclination towards nature and animals makes this slightly less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science, but still reasonably probable.
