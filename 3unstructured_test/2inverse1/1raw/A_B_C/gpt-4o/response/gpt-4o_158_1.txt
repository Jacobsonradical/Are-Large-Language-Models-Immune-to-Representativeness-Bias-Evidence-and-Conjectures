Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and considering his traits and interests, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Explanation:

- **Computer Science**: Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which can correlate with strengths and interests in computer science. However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals suggest that it may not be the most likely field for him. 
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns very closely with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These interests and values strongly suggest a high probability for this field.
- **Business Administration**: While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts can be valuable in business administration, his deep love for animals and nature-oriented curiosity do not directly align with the typical interests and motivators in this field, resulting in a lower probability.
