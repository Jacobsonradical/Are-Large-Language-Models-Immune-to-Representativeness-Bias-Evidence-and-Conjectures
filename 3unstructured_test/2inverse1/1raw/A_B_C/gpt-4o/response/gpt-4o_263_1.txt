This is because Adam's curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align most closely with fields related to agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts support the possibility of him being in computer science, though perhaps slightly less so given his strong inclination toward nature and animals. The probability of him being in business administration is lower because it does not align as well with his described interests and personality traits.
