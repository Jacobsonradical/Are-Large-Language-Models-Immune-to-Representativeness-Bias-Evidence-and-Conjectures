Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These estimations are based on how well the personality traits align with each field. Adam's curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals align closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him suitable for computer science. However, his traits seem less aligned with business administration, thus the lower probability for that field.
