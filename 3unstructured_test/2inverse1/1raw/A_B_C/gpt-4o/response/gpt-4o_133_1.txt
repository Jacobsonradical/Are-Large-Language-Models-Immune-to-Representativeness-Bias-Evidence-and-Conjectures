Based on the information provided in the personality sketch and considering the alignment between Adam's interests and the fields mentioned, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, this field seems highly compatible with his personality traits.
- **Computer science**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence, which indicates a good understanding of abstract concepts, align well with this field. However, his strong empathy and love for animals are less directly linked to computer science, reducing the probability somewhat.
- **Business administration**: While Adam's strong empathy and appreciation for hard work can be beneficial in business, the majority of his interests and traits (e.g., curiosity about plants and animals) do not strongly align with this field, making it the least likely among the three.
