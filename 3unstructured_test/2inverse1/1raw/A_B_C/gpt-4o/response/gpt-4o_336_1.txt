Here is my assessment of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if Adam was enrolled in that field:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These estimates are based on the characteristics described in the personality sketch. The high probability for agricultural and veterinary science reflects his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy. The moderate probability for computer science is due to his enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence. The low probability for business administration is due to the fact that his interests and empathy seem more aligned with nature and animals rather than business.
