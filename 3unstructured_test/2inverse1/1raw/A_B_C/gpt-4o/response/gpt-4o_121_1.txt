Explanation:

- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Adam's high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles align well with the skills necessary for computer science. However, the personality sketch emphasizes his connection to nature and animals, making it less likely but not impossible.
  
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: The personality traits described do not strongly align with the typical characteristics associated with business administration, which often values leadership, management, and economic skills over an intrinsic connection with nature and animals.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, agricultural and veterinary science appears to be the most fitting field. His personality traits align closely with the requirements and interests typically found in this field.
