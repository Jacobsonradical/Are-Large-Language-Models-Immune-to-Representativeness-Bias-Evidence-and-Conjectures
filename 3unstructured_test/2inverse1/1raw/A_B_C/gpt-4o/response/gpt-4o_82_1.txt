- **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.7)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals, this field seems highly probable for him. His warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align well with professions in this area which often involve understanding and caring for animals and plants.

- **Computer science (0.5)**: While Adam’s enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts fit well with computer science, his strong love for nature and animals doesn’t directly correlate with this field. However, the analytical and problem-solving skills required in computer science could still attract someone with his profile.

- **Business administration (0.2)**: This field seems less likely given Adam’s personality traits. While appreciation for hard work is relevant, business administration doesn’t have a direct connection to his stated interests in nature, animals, and empathy-driven care, making it the least probable choice based on the provided sketch.
