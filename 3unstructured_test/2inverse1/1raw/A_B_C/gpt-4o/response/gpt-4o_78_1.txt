Sure, based on the personality sketch provided:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These estimates take into account Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts could also align with computer science, though it is less directly connected to his stated interests. Business administration seems to be the least likely fit based on his described personality traits and interests.
