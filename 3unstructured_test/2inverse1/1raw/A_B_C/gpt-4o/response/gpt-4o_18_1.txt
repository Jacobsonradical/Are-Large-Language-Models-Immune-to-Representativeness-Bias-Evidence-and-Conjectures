The subject's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, making it the most probable field of study. High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could point towards computer science, but it doesn't align as well with other inferred personal interests. Business administration is less likely given the subject's interests and personality traits.
