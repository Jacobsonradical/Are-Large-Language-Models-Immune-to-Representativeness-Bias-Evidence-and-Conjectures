Explanation: The strong appreciation for nature, plants, and animals, along with a warm heart and empathy, aligns closely with agricultural and veterinary science. The high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science, but the deep love for animals makes agricultural and veterinary science more probable. Business administration seems the least likely because it typically does not align as closely with the attributes described in the personality sketch.
