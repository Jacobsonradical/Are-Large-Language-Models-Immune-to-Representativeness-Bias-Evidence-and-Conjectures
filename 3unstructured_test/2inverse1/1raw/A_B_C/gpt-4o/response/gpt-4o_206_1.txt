- Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, there's a strong indication that he might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- The probability is lower for business administration as the personality traits described (empathy, love for animals, interest in nature) do not strongly correlate with typical motivations for pursuing a business degree.
- Computer science has a moderate probability given his high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, even though these traits also align with the field of computer science.
