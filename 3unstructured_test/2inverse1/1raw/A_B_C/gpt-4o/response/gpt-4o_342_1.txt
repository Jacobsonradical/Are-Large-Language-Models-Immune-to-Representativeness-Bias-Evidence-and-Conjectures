Based on the personality sketch provided, here's my estimate of the probability that the profile matches Adam if he was enrolled in each of the given fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

The subject's love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy aligns strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. They may have some interest in abstract concepts which is characteristic of computer science, hence a moderate probability. The characteristics described are less likely to fit the profile typically associated with business administration, thus the lower probability.
