Explanation:
- "computer science": A subject with a high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts could be well-suited to computer science. However, the strong empathy and love for animals seem less directly related to typical computer science pursuits, thus a moderate probability.
- "business administration": While an understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication can be valuable in this field, the specific traits of curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals align less naturally with business administration. Therefore, a low probability is assigned.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": The personality sketch closely matches this field due to the subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. These traits are highly relevant to agricultural and veterinary sciences, leading to a high probability.
