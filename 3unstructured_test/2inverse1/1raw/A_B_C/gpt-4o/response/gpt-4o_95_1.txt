Taking into account the details of Adam's personality sketch, here's a probability estimate for each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Adam's detailed interest in nature, plants, animals, puzzles, and empathy for others suggests he may not be inclined towards a field traditionally driven by economics, finance, and managerial tasks. 

- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Given Adam's high intelligence and capability with abstract concepts, computer science is a plausible field, especially with the emphasis on problem-solving. However, the specific interests in nature, plants, and animals place some doubts.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8)**: The probability is highest here, considering Adam's profound love for nature, plants, and animals. His empathy and understanding of hard work align well with the demands and characteristics often associated with this field.
