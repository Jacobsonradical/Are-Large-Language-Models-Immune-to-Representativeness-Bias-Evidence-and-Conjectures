Explanation:
1. **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.7)**: Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it aligns well with a field focused on agricultural and veterinary sciences.
2. **Business administration (0.2)**: While Adam's high intelligence and problem-solving skills could suit a business administration field, the sketch does not highlight any specific interests or skills that are typically more aligned with business studies.
3. **Computer science (0.3)**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and good understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals might make this field slightly less probable compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
