Based on Adam's personality sketch and considering his interests and characteristics, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These probabilities reflect Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy, which align well with agricultural and veterinary science. His abstract thinking skills and aptitude for solving puzzles suggest some compatibility with computer science. However, his personality traits seem less aligned with business administration, despite his appreciation for hard work and dedication.
