Based on the personality sketch provided, here are estimates of the probability that the subject's personality traits align with each field of study:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

### Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: The subject has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which align well with the skills needed in computer science. However, there is no direct mention of an interest in technology, which tempers the probability.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: The subject has a strong curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and empathy. These traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science, making it the most likely field.
  
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While the subject has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, other traits such as empathy and love for animals do not strongly align with typical business administration interests, making this the least likely field among the three.
