I have assigned the highest probability to agricultural and veterinary science because Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align closely with this field. Computer science is also plausible due to his intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, but it seems less likely given the specific emphasis on nature and animals. Business administration is the least likely, as it does not directly correlate with his described interests and personality traits.
