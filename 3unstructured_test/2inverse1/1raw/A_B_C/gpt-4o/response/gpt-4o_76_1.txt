Given the personality sketch and the fields provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

**Justification:**
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns well with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. Moreover, understanding abstract concepts can be quite useful in scientific research in this domain.
  
- **Business Administration**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication could be useful in business, the lack of specific interest or traits related to business management and administration lowers the probability.
  
- **Computer Science**: Adamâ€™s enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts fit well in computer science. However, there are fewer direct connections between his love for nature and animals and the field of computer science, which moderates the probability.

These estimates reflect the alignment of Adam's described traits with the characteristics and requirements of each field.
