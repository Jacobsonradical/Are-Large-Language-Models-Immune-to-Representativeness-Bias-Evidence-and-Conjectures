Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the best estimates for the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, if Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

### Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals aligns strongly with this field. His empathy and appreciation for hard work also fit well with the demands of agricultural and veterinary studies.
  
- **Business Administration (0.2):** While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be beneficial in business administration, his interests in nature, plants, and animals do not align as closely with this field. Therefore, the probability is lower.

- **Computer Science (0.6):** Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence match well with computer science. Although his love for nature and animals doesn't directly relate to computer science, it's plausible that someone with these interests might still choose this field due to its problem-solving nature and abstract thinking.
