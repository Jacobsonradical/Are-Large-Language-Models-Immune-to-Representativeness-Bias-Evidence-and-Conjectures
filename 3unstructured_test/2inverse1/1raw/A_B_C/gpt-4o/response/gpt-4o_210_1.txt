Explanation: 

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it is highly likely that his personality aligns with a field that involves nature and animals. Hence, a high probability of 0.8 is assigned.
  
- **Business administration**: Adam's characteristics do not align closely with the typical traits or interests one would expect from someone in the field of business administration. Thus, a low probability of 0.1 is assigned.
  
- **Computer science**: While Adam's quiet nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and high intelligence could fit well with computer science, the specific mentions of love for animals and nature make this slightly less likely. Therefore, a moderate probability of 0.3 is assigned.
