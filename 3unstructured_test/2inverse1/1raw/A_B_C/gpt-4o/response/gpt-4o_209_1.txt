Certainly! Here are the estimated probabilities based on the provided personality sketch for Adam, assuming he was enrolled in each respective field:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

These estimates are based on the attributes listed in the personality sketch, such as a strong empathy for animals and a curiosity about nature, which align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might relate to computer science, though less so than agricultural sciences given his noted empathy and love for animals. Business administration seems the least likely, given the focus on nature and animals.
