Explanation: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and high empathy, it seems more likely that he would be involved in a field strongly connected to nature and life sciences, which explains the high probability for agricultural and veterinary science. Although his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could also suit computer science, his personality traits seem to align less with business administration.
