Explanation:
- Agricultural and veterinary science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his deep love for animals, it is highly probable that he is enrolled in this field. The strong empathy and appreciation for hard work also align well with this discipline.
- Business administration: While people in business administration can be diverse, Adam's specific interests in nature and animals, along with his quiet demeanor and puzzle-solving skills, are less directly relevant to this field. Therefore, the probability is lower.
- Computer science: High intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with computer science. Additionally, enjoying solving puzzles is a trait that correlates with the logical and problem-solving skills required in this field. Although his love for nature and animals is less directly relevant, it still makes this a plausible field.
