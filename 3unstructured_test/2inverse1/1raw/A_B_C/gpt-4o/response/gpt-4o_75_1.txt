Explanation:
- Agricultural and veterinary science: The personality sketch indicates a strong affinity for nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with fields related to agriculture and veterinary science.
- Computer science: The interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, particularly in understanding abstract concepts, suggests some suitability for computer science, especially if there's an overlap with data science related to natural phenomena.
- Business administration: This field seems least likely given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, which do not typically align with the primary interests and focuses of business administration.
