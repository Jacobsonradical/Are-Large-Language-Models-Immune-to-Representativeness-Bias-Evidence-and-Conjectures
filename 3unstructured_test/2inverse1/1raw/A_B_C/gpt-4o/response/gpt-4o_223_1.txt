Explanation:
- Considering Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants, there is a high probability that the personality sketch fits someone in agricultural and veterinary science.
- Although Adamâ€™s intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles can fit computer science well, his personality traits related to nature and animals make this field slightly less probable.
