The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align very well with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the highest probability. The abstract problem-solving skills and high intelligence could fit computer science, albeit less directly when considering the specific interests in nature and animals. Business administration seems less likely given the subjectâ€™s described interests and personality traits.
