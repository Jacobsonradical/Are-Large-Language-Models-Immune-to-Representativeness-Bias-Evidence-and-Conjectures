Based on the given personality sketch and its alignment with the characteristics typically associated with different fields of study, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

This estimation is based on Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which align closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts could also fit with computer science, but the love for nature and animals is less directly associated with business administration, leading to a lower probability for that field.
