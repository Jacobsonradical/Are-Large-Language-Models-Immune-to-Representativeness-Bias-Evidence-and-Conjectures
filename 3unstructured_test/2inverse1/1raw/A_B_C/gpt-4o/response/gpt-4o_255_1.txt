Given Adam's personality sketch, we can assign the probabilities based on the alignment of his personality traits with the typical interests and skills required in each field.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

**Rationale:**

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** This field aligns closely with Adam’s interests in nature, plants, and animals. His empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are also strong indicators that he would thrive in this field, hence the higher probability.
  
- **Business Administration:** This field does not align well with Adam’s described interests and traits. A quiet boy with a love for solving puzzles and animals is less likely to be drawn to the profit-driven, people-oriented nature of business administration, leading to a lower probability.
  
- **Computer Science:** While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could make him successful in computer science, there’s less indication he has a specific passion for this field compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, the probability is moderate but not as high as for agricultural and veterinary science.
