The subject described has a strong affinity for nature, plants, animals, and abstract problem solving. These traits align most closely with agricultural and veterinary science, making it the most probable field of study. Computer science is also a possibility given the subject's interest in puzzles and high intelligence. Business administration, however, seems less likely due to the subject's primary interests and empathetic nature.
