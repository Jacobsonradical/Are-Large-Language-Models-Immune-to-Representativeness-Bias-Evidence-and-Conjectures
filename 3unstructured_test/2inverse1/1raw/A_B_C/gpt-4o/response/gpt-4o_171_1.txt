Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimates for the probability that it was about Adam, if he was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These estimates are based on the alignment of Adam's characteristics and interests with the respective fields. His genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy are highly congruent with agricultural and veterinary science. These traits are less typically associated with business administration, and while they can be relevant to certain aspects of computer science (e.g., solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts), they are not as strongly indicative of that field as they are of agricultural and veterinary science.
