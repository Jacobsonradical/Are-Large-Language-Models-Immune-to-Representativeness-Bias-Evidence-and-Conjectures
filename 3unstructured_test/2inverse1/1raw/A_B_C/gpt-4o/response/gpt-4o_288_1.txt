Based on the personality sketch provided and considering Adam was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: The personality traits such as genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and a love for animals highly align with this field. Therefore, the probability is relatively high at 0.8.

- **Business administration**: While the traits of high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts can fit this field, the strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are less typical. Hence, this connection is estimated at a lower probability of 0.2.

- **Computer science**: The traits of enjoying solving puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, the love for animals and nature-related curiosity do not specifically indicate this field, resulting in an intermediate probability of 0.5.
