Sure, based on the provided personality sketch, here is my estimate:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Explanation:
- **Business administration (0.1)**: The personality sketch does not align much with the traits typically emphasized or observed in this field, such as a strong focus on leadership, financial acumen, or commercial interests.
- **Computer science (0.3)**: The subject's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence could relate to computer science, where problem-solving and abstract thinking are crucial. However, other aspects of his personality, like his strong empathy and love for animals, are less directly related to this field.
- **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.8)**: This field aligns closely with the subject's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with the characteristics needed in agricultural and veterinary professions.
