  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2

- **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.8)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals makes it highly likely that he would be enrolled in a field closely related to these interests.
  
- **Computer science (0.6)**: Though it's not directly related to nature and animals, Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence would make him well-suited for computer science, which often involves abstract problem-solving.
  
- **Business administration (0.2)**: While his appreciation for hard work and dedication are notable qualities, his specific interests in nature, plants, and animals do not strongly align with a focus on business administration.
