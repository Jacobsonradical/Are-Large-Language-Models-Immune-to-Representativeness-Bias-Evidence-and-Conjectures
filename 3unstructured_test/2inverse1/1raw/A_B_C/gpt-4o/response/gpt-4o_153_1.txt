Sure, based on the personality sketch provided and the known interests and traits of Adam, I would estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Explanation:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, this field aligns closely with his interests and traits.
  
- **Computer Science:** Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are important attributes in computer science.
  
- **Business Administration:** While business administration may appreciate hard work and dedication, it doesn't align as well with Adam's specific interests in nature, animals, and solving puzzles. Thus, the probability is lower here.
