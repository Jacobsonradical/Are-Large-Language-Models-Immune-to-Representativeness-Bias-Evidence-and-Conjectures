Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: High probability (0.7) because Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work align well with this field.
- **Business administration**: Low probability (0.1) as Adam's traits and interests in nature, puzzles, and animals don't particularly align with typical interests in business administration.
- **Computer science**: Moderate probability (0.6) because Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his ability to understand abstract concepts are strong indicators that he could excel in and be interested in computer science.
