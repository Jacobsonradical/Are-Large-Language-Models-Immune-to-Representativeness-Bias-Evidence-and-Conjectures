Explanation:

- **Computer Science (0.4):** While quiet, puzzle-solving, and high intelligence can be traits often associated with computer science students, the strong focus on nature, plants, and animals makes it slightly less likely but still plausible.

- **Business Administration (0.1):** The emphasis on empathy, a love for animals, and nature doesn't strongly align with a typical business administration profile, making it less likely.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** The deep interest in nature, plants, and animals strongly aligns with this field, making it the most likely scenario among the three.
