Explanation:

- "computer science": A genuine curiosity about nature and solving puzzles aligns somewhat with computer science, but the connection with nature and plants makes it less likely overall.
- "business administration": The traits described (curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals) don't strongly align with business administration, making it the least probable field.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": The high probability here is due to the subject's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as their empathy and appreciation for hard work, which are very relevant for this field.
