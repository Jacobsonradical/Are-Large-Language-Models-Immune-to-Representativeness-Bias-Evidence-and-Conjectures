Given Adam's interest and characteristics as described in the personality sketch, here are the estimated probabilities:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, along with his love for animals and strong empathy, align very well with this field. This makes it a highly probable match.

- **Business Administration**: Although Adam is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, there is less alignment with his specific interests and personality traits. Business Administration typically emphasizes skills such as leadership, strategy, and organizational management, which are not clearly highlighted in the personality sketch.

- **Computer Science**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, especially in understanding abstract concepts, align well with the skills needed in computer science. However, the sketch does not mention a strong interest in technology or programming, which slightly lowers the match.
