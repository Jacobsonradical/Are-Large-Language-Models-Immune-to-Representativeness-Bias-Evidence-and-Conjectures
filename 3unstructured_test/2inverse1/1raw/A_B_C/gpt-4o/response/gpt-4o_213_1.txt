Based on Adam's personality sketch, the probability estimates for each field would be:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals and high intelligence, agricultural and veterinary science seems to be the most fitting field. Computer science could also be a good match due to his love for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. Business administration seems less likely due to the lack of direct alignment with his interests and personality traits.
