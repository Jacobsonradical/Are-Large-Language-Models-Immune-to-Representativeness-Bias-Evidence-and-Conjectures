  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

Hereâ€™s the reasoning behind each estimate:

- **Business Administration**: A genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy are less characteristic of someone enrolled in business administration, where the focus may be more on economics, management, and organizational behavior. Thus, the probability is quite low but not zero because interests can be broad.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns closely with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals. His empathy and appreciation for hard work also resonate with the dedication required in this field. Therefore, the probability is high.

- **Computer Science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, the strong focus on nature and animals is less aligned with this field. This creates a moderate probability.
