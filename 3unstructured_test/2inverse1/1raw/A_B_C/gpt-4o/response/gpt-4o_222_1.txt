Sure, based on the provided personality sketch and taking into account Adam's traits and interests, here is the estimated probability for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

These estimates are based on the following reasoning:

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and his love for animals strongly align with this field, making it the most likely option.
- **Business administration**: While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work could be assets in this field, the connection to his specific interests in nature and animals is weaker, making this a less likely option.
- **Computer science**: Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and abstract concepts suggests a potential interest in computer science. This field, however, does not directly connect with his interest in nature and animals, making it a moderately probable option.
