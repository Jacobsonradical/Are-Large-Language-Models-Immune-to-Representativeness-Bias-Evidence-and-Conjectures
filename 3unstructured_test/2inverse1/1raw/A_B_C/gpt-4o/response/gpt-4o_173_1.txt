Explanation:
- **Business administration:** The personality sketch doesn't strongly align with typical traits associated with business administration, such as a major focus on leadership, finance, or economics.
- **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The subjectâ€™s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work aligns very well with this field.
- **Computer science:** The quiet nature, enjoyment of puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts suggest a potential fit for computer science, though less so than agricultural and veterinary science.
