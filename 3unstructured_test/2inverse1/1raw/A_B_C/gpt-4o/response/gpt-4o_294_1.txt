Explanation:
- **Business administration**: Given the personality sketch focuses on nature, a love for animals, and solving puzzles, this field seems less likely but not entirely impossible if Adam had a unique interest in business aspects related to environmental or animal care sectors.
- **Computer science**: High intelligence and an enjoyment of solving puzzles align with computer science, but the deep love for nature and animals points to a field that is more directly related to those interests.
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: The subjectâ€™s love for animals, nature, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with this field, making it the most probable choice.
