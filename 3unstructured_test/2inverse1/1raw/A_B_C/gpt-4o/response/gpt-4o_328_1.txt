Explanation:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it is highly likely that he would be enrolled in a program related to agriculture or veterinary science.
- Business Administration: The personality traits and interests described do not strongly align with a typical profile for a business administration student. Thus, the probability is relatively low.
- Computer Science: While Adam's interest in solving puzzles and his high intelligence could make him a good fit for computer science, his deeper love for nature and animals suggests a slightly lower probability than agricultural and veterinary science.
