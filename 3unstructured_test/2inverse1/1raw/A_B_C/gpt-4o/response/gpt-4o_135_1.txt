Explanation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: This field seems most aligned with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. His traits suggest he would likely be drawn to a field where he could work closely with plants and animals.
- **Computer science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are traits suitable for computer science, his strong empathy and love for animals suggest he might prefer a field where he can directly interact with nature.
- **Business administration**: This field does not seem to align closely with Adam's described interests and traits. While he understands hard work and dedication, his love for nature, animals, and abstract thinking does not strongly suggest a fit with business administration.
