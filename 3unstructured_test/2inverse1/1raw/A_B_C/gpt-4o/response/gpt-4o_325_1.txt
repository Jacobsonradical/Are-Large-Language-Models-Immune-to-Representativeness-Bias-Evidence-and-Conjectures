**Explanation:**

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Considering Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, there is a high probability that this personality sketch fits someone in agricultural and veterinary science. This field aligns well with his love for nature and animals.

2. **Computer Science**: While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts, which are relevant skills for computer science, his warm heart, empathy, and deep love for nature and animals do not as strongly align with the typical interests and focuses associated with this field. Therefore, the probability is moderate but not as high as for agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Business Administration**: This field typically focuses more on management, finance, and organizational skills. Adam's personality traits — such as his empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature — are less directly associated with the typical interests and skills needed for business administration. While there is always some overlap, the probability is lower compared to the other fields.
