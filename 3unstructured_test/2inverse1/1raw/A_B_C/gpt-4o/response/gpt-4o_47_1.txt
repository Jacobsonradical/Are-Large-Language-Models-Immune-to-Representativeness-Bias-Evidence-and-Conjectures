Based on the personality sketch provided and considering the graduate fields mentioned, here is the estimated probability for each field:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

These estimates are based on the information that Adam has a strong love for nature, animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which aligns closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His skills in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science as well, though his deep curiosity about nature suggests a stronger fit for the agricultural and veterinary science field. Business administration seems the least likely, given the sketch's lack of focus on business-related traits.
