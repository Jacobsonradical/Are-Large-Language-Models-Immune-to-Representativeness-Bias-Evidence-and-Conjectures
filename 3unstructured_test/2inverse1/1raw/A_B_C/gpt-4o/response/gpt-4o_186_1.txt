Given the personality sketch, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

- **Business Administration**: The probability is relatively low because the description does not mention any interests or tendencies aligned with business concepts or management. 

- **Computer Science**: The probability is moderate because the individual enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with good abstract understanding, which are qualities beneficial in computer science. However, the lack of mention of technology or programming interests makes us lower this probability.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The probability is highest for this field because the subject has a genuine curiosity about nature, a strong empathy for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, all of which align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences.
