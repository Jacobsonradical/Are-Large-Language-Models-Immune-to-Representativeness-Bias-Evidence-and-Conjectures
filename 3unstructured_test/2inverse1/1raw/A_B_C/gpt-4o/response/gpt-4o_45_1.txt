Explanation:
- Business Administration: The likelihood is low because the personality sketch highlights a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, which are not typically associated with business administration.
  
- Computer Science: The likelihood is moderate because the subject's high intelligence, affinity for solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts align well with skills needed in computer science. However, the strong interest in plants and animals makes this field less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: The likelihood is high because this field directly aligns with the subject's curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy. The appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with the demands of this field.
