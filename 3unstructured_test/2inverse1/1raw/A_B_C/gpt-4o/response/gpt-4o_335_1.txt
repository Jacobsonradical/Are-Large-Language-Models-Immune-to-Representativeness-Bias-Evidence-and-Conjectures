Explanation:
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, this field is highly relevant. The traits described are well-aligned with someone who would be passionate about studying agriculture or veterinary sciences.
- "computer science": While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, which are traits valued in computer science, his strong empathy and love for the natural world are not directly linked to this field. Hence, the probability is moderate.
- "business administration": This field is more oriented towards business skills and administrative tasks, which do not directly correlate with Adam's described traits of empathy, nature, and love for animals. Therefore, the probability is relatively low.
