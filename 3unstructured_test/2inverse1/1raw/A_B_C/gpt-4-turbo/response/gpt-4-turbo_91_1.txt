Based on the personality sketch you provided and considering Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals along with high intelligence and problem-solving skills, here are the estimated probabilities of the sketch referring to Adam in each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.5"
}

These estimates reflect that while Adam seems like a likely candidate for agricultural and veterinary science due to his love for nature and animals, his problem-solving abilities and intelligence could also align with studies in computer science. Business administration seems less likely due to the absence of any direct references to skills or interests typically associated with business fields in the personality sketch.
