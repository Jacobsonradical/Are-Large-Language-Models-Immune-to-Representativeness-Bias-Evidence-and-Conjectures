Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

- Business administration tends to focus on management, finance, marketing, and operations. While intelligence and understanding would be beneficial, the specific interests and qualities described (a love for nature and animals, and solving puzzles) are less directly aligned with typical business administration coursework or career paths.

- Computer science involves solving complex problems and often requires a high level of intelligence and the capacity to understand abstract concepts. Though it aligns with the problem-solving aspect and intelligence, the strong emphasis on nature and animals is less directly relevant.

- Agricultural and veterinary science connects directly to a love for nature and animals, requires a good understanding of biological processes, and often involves problem-solving related to those areas. This field aligns closely with the described interests in nature, plants, and animal welfare, as well as the capacity for understanding complex, scientific concepts.

Considering these points, here are the estimated probabilities:
