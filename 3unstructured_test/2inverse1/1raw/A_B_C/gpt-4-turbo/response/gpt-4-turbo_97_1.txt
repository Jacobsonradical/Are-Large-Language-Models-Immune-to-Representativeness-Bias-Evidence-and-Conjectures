Based on the given personality sketch and the typical associations with different academic fields, I can estimate the probability that Adam, described as a curious individual with an interest in nature, empathy, high intelligence, and an appreciation for dedication, could be enrolled in each of these fields:

- Business Administration: Generally, fields like business administration focus more on strategic, operational, managerial, and financial skills rather than intrinsic nature and personal empathy. Although empathy and intelligence are valuable in every field, the specific interests in plants and animals as well as puzzles might not directly align with typical business studies. 

- Computer Science: This field often attracts individuals who have strong analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. Adam’s interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence might correlate well with computer science. However, his profound curiosity about nature and plants is less typically connected to computer science.

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: This field directly aligns with interests in plants, animals, and nature. Adam’s blend of empathy, intelligence, and specific love for nature-related aspects are very typical traits for students in this domain.

The estimated probabilities would then look like:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.5",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
