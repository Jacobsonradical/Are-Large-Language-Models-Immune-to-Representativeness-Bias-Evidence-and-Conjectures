Based on the personality sketch described, here are the estimated probabilities for each field stated that Adam was enrolled in:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The reasoning for these probabilities:
- The personality sketch suggests a strong alignment with fields involving natural sciences and empathy toward living beings, thereby making Agricultural and Veterinary Science a higher probability due to the connection with nature and animals.
- Computer Science, although less directly related to nature or animals, can align with the subject's high intelligence and problem-solving skills.
- Business Administration receives the lowest estimate as it is less aligned with personal interests in nature, animals, or abstract problem solving.
