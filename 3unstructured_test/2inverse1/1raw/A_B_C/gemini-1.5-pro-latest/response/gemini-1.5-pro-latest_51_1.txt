Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and some very general statistics:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. These are core interests for individuals in these fields, making it the most likely match.

* **Computer Science:**  While not as strong a match as the first, the description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with skills valued in computer science. It's plausible Adam could be drawn to the problem-solving aspects of this field.

* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely fit. The sketch lacks any mention of typical business interests like finance, marketing, or management.  While Adam's intelligence and work ethic could translate to business, his core personality traits point more strongly elsewhere.
