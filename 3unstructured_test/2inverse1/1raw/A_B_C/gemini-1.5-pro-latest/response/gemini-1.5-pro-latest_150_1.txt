**Explanation:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific understanding. This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" the most likely field for Adam.

While "computer science" values intelligence and abstract thinking, the sketch lacks typical markers like a passion for technology or problem-solving with code.

"Business administration" is the least likely, as the sketch emphasizes empathy and appreciation for hard work, which, while valuable in business, aren't the defining traits often associated with that field.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information. Many individuals in ANY field can have these personality traits.
