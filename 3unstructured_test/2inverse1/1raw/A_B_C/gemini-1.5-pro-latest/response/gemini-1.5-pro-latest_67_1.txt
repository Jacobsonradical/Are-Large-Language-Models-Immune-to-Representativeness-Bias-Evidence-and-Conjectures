Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose guidelines based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field: love for animals, curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work (common in agriculture).
* **Computer Science:**  While intelligence and puzzle-solving ability are common in computer science, the other traits are less specific. It's plausible, but less likely than agricultural science based on the description.
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely fit. The personality sketch lacks traits often associated with business, like ambition, leadership, or financial acumen. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly subjective.  People's personalities and career choices are complex.  There are many compassionate computer scientists and analytical veterinarians out there!
