Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things. This makes a strong case for Adam being in this field. 
* **Computer Science:**  While not as strong a connection, high intelligence and the ability to grasp abstract concepts are common in computer science students. This field is certainly possible.
* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch lacks typical traits associated with business administration (e.g., strong leadership, focus on finance/management). While not impossible, it's less likely.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative.  People are diverse, and individual students within any field can possess a wide range of interests and personalities.
