Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.15"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific understanding. This field aligns most closely with those traits.
* **Computer Science:**  While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects fit well with computer science, the sketch lacks a strong indicator of a passion for technology or programming. It's plausible, but the other fields have stronger signals. 
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely. The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for nature, and understanding hard work â€“ traits not typically highlighted in business-oriented personalities.

**Important Notes:**

* **Subjectivity:** These probabilities are based on subjective interpretation of the sketch. There's no statistically "correct" answer.
* **Individual Variation:**  Fields are diverse. Many computer scientists love nature, and some businesspeople are deeply empathetic. This exercise relies on broad generalizations. 
* **Limited Information:**  The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality, but  factors like upbringing, experiences, and specific interests could heavily influence his field of study.
