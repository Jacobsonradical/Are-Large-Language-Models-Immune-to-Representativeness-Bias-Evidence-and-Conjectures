Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The sketch heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This strongly suggests a field related to agriculture or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  The description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could point towards computer science. However, the lack of any direct mention of technology or programming makes it less likely than agricultural/veterinary science.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The personality sketch doesn't align well with typical traits associated with business administration. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the core interests described don't point towards this field.
