Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The strongest indicators point here: "genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants," "deep love for animals," and an appreciation for "hard work and dedication" (often associated with agricultural fields).

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  "Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles" and "high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts" strongly suggest an aptitude for computer science. 

* **Business Administration (0.1):** The personality sketch doesn't offer strong indicators aligning with a typical business administration student.  While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the other traits point more strongly towards the other fields.
