**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. 

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  This field aligns most closely with the description. A love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in this field. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** While not as strong a fit as Agricultural and Veterinary Science, the "enjoyment of solving puzzles" and "high intelligence" could point to an aptitude for computer science.  
* **Business Administration (0.2):** The sketch provides the least support for this field. While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business, the other traits are less characteristic of typical interests in this area.
