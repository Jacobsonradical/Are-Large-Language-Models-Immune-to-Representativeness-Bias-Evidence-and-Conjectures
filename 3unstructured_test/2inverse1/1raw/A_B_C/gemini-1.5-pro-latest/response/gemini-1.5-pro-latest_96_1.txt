Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (Highest Probability):** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science (Moderate Probability):**  The traits "enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are common among those in computer science.  While not as strong a connection as with agricultural fields, it's still a plausible fit.
* **Business Administration (Lowest Probability):** The personality sketch lacks traits often associated with business administration, such as a focus on leadership, management, or financial success. While someone in business can certainly have these interests, the description doesn't point in that direction. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a brief personality sketch.  Individual interests and career choices are complex, and it's impossible to determine Adam's field of study with certainty.
