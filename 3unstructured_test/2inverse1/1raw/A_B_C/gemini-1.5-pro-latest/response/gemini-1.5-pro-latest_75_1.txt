Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with the mention of "hard work and dedication" (often associated with these fields), makes it the most likely area of study for Adam. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The description of Adam enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with a computer science student.  However, the lack of specific mentions of technology or programming makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
* **Business Administration (0.2):**  The personality sketch provides little to no direct correlation with typical interests in business administration. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the other traits point more strongly towards the other fields.
