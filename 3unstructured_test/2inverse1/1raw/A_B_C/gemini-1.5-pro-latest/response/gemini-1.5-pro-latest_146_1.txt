Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific understanding. This aligns most closely with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, making it the most probable field for Adam. 

* **Computer Science:** The puzzle-solving aptitude and comfort with abstract concepts point towards potential interest in computer science.  While not as strong a match as the agricultural field, it's still a reasonable possibility.

* **Business Administration:** The personality description doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business. While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, the other traits don't align as strongly. This makes it the least likely field for Adam based on the sketch.
