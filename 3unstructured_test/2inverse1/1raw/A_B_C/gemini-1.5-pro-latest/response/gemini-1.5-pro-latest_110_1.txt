Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field. Love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in those pursuing these careers. 
* **Computer Science:** While intelligence and abstract thinking are important for computer science, the personality sketch lacks direct indicators like interest in technology or programming.  It's possible, but less likely than agricultural sciences.
* **Business Administration:**  This field is the least likely fit.  The sketch emphasizes empathy and a connection to nature, which are not as central to typical business administration career paths.

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective assessment based on limited information.  Many individuals in computer science or business administration could have the described traits.
