Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):**  The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  This aligns most directly with fields like agriculture, botany, or veterinary medicine. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and appreciation for abstract concepts could suggest an affinity for computer science.  High intelligence is also common in this field.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest an interest in business. While empathy is valuable in business, the other traits point more strongly towards fields related to science and nature. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information. A person's true interests and field of study are complex and can't be fully determined from a brief sketch.
