Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests this field.  Love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all highly aligned with this field. 
* **Computer Science:**  Intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** The sketch doesn't offer strong indicators for business administration. While intelligence and empathy can be helpful, they aren't specific enough to suggest a high probability. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on stereotypes. People's personalities and career choices are complex! There's a chance Adam could be in any of these fields or something else entirely.
