Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, plants, and animals.  The mention of empathy and a love for animals particularly points towards veterinary science. This field aligns best with the described personality.

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and high intelligence are common traits in computer science students.  However, the other traits are less specific to this field. It's plausible, but not as strong a fit as agricultural/veterinary science.

* **Business Administration (0.1):** The sketch provides little indication of interest in business, finance, or management. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the other traits don't strongly align. This field is the least likely match.
