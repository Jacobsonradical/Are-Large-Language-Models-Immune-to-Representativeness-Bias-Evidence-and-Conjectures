Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The strongest indicators point towards this field.  The description explicitly mentions "curiosity about nature and its various plants" and a "deep love for animals".  These are core interests for someone in this field. 
* **Computer Science:**  While not as strong as the connection to agriculture, the description of the subject enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with skills often found in computer science students.
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the description.  There's nothing in the sketch that directly suggests an interest in business or administration. While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, they aren't unique to this field.
