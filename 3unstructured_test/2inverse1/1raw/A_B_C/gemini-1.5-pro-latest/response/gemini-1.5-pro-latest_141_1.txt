Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work align well with agricultural and veterinary pursuits. 
* **Computer Science:** While high intelligence and abstract thinking are relevant to computer science, the other traits are not as strong of indicators. It's possible, but less likely given the other interests described.
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely. The sketch lacks typical indicators associated with business administration, such as an interest in finance, management, or marketing. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch. Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
