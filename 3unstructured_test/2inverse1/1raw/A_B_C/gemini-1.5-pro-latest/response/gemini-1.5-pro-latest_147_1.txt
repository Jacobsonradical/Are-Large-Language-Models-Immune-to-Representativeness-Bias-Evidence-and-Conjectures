**Explanation:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):** The description heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals, making this the most likely field for Adam. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The puzzle-solving ability and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science. Hence, a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, the description lacks clear indicators of interest in business, finance, or management. Thus, the probability is low.
