**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific pursuits.  Let's break down why the probabilities are assigned as such:

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** This is the most likely field given the direct mentions of:
    * "Curiosity about nature and its various plants"
    * "Deep love for animals" 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** While not as strong a connection as Agricultural/Veterinary Science, the following traits have some overlap with computer science:
    * "Enjoys solving puzzles" -  Problem-solving is central to computer science.
    * "High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts" -  Necessary skills in computer science.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The personality sketch provides little indication of interest in business, finance, or management. The traits mentioned don't strongly align with this field. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a brief personality sketch.  Many other factors (personal experiences, career goals, etc.) influence a person's field of study.
