Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  The description aligns strongly with this field:
    *  "Curiosity about nature and its plants" is a core interest for those in agriculture.
    * "Love for animals" is practically a requirement for veterinary science. 
    * "Understanding and appreciation for hard work" fits the agricultural lifestyle.

* **Computer Science:**
    * "Enjoys solving puzzles" and "high intelligence" are common traits among computer science students.
    * "Understanding abstract concepts" is essential for programming and computer science theory.
    * However, the other traits (love for animals, nature) are less directly relevant. 

* **Business Administration:**
    * This field has the weakest connection to the personality description. 
    * While intelligence and problem-solving are valuable in business, the other traits are not as strong of indicators. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on the provided information. There's significant overlap between personality traits and career choices. Many individuals in any field could share aspects of this description.
