Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, plants, animals, and potentially understanding biological systems. These align perfectly with agricultural and veterinary sciences. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** While not as strong a fit as the first, the mention of "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts" could point towards a computer science aptitude.  Some individuals in this field are drawn to it for the intellectual challenge and problem-solving aspects.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The sketch provides little to connect Adam to business administration.  While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, they aren't specific indicators of interest in this field. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a brief personality sketch.  People's interests and career paths are complex. There's always a chance Adam could be drawn to any of these fields for reasons not mentioned in the sketch.
