Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on personality inferences and not hard data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, plants, and animals.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" fits the image of these fields. This makes it the most likely field for Adam.

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  "Puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" are strong indicators of a computer science aptitude. While not as direct a fit as the first, it's still plausible. 

* **Business Administration (0.2):** The sketch doesn't align well with typical business traits (competitiveness, risk-taking, etc.). While empathy is useful in business, it's not the primary driver.  This makes it the least likely.

**Important Note:** Personality sketches are very limited. Adam's actual field could be influenced by factors not mentioned here (family tradition, specific career goals, etc.).
