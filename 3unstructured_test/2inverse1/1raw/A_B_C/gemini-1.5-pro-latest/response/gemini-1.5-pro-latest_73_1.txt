Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided is very limited:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch heavily emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things. This strongly suggests a higher probability of Adam being in this field.
* **Computer Science (0.4):** The mention of "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts" aligns somewhat with computer science stereotypes.  However, the lack of direct mention of technology or programming makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
* **Business Administration (0.2):**  The personality sketch provides little to no correlation with typical traits associated with business administration. While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, the emphasis on nature and empathy makes this field the least likely. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember these are just educated guesses.  People are diverse, and personality doesn't dictate career choice. This information should not be used for any real-world decision-making about individuals.
