Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  A love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits of individuals drawn to these areas. 
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence could point towards computer science, the lack of specific mentions of technology or programming makes it less likely than agricultural/veterinary science.  
* **Business Administration:** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest an interest in business. The emphasis on empathy and nature seems less aligned with a typical business administration student. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a brief personality sketch.  Individual interests and paths are diverse, and it's impossible to definitively determine someone's field of study based solely on this information.
