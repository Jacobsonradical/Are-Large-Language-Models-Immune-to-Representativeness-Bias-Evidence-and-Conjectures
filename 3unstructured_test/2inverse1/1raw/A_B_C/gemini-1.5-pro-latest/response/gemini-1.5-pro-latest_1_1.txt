  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field due to the emphasis on "curiosity about nature and plants," "love for animals," and understanding of "hard work and dedication" often associated with agriculture. 
* **Computer Science:**  "Enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are traits often found in computer science students, making this a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the description lacks a strong indication of interest in business concepts, making it the least likely field.
