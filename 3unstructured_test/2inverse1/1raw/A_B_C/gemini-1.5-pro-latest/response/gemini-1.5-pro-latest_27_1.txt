Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to animals or agriculture.

* **Computer Science (0.3):** While not as strong a connection as with agricultural sciences, the description mentions enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. These are traits often associated with individuals interested in computer science.

* **Business Administration (0.1):**  The personality sketch doesn't offer strong indicators aligning with typical business administration stereotypes. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the description lacks indicators like an interest in leadership, finance, or market dynamics.
