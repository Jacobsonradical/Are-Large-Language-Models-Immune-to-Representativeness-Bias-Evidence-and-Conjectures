Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to animals and agriculture.

* **Computer Science (0.4):** The "quiet, puzzle-solving" aspect aligns with common perceptions of computer science students.  High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are also relevant to the field. However, the sketch lacks direct indicators of a passion for technology or programming.

* **Business Administration (0.1):** This field has the weakest connection to the personality description.  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination.
