Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, plants, and animals.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" also aligns well with these fields. This gets the highest probability.
* **Computer Science:**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and "high intelligence/abstract concepts" fit the profile of someone in computer science. However, the other traits are less specific to this field.
* **Business Administration:**  The personality description doesn't strongly align with a typical business administration student. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the other traits are less common focuses in this area. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on stereotypes.  People's personalities and interests are diverse, and there's significant overlap between fields.
