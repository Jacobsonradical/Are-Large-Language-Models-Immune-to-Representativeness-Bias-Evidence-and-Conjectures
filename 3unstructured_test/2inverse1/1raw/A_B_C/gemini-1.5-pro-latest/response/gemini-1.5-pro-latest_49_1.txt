Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on personality stereotypes and the sketch provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.5"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific understanding. This makes fields like agriculture or veterinary medicine highly probable.
* **Computer Science (0.5):**  While not as strong a connection as with agriculture, the "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence hint at aptitude for computer science. However, the lack of direct mention of technology keeps this at a moderate probability. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** The sketch emphasizes empathy, warmth, and appreciation for hard work. While these are positive traits in any field, they don't particularly point towards a business-oriented personality. This gets the lowest probability.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that personality sketches are not definitive predictors of someone's field of study. People are diverse, and many individuals in each of these fields might possess the described traits.
