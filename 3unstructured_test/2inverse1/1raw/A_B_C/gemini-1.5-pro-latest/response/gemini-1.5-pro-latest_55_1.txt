Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, plants, and animals.  Combined with intelligence and empathy, this field is a very likely fit.
* **Computer Science (0.4):** The puzzle-solving ability and aptitude for abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, the sketch lacks a clear indication of interest in technology or programming. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):**  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch doesn't point to traits typically associated with this field, such as leadership, risk-taking, or a focus on financial gain.
