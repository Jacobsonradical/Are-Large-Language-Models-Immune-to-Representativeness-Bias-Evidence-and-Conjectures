Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the description could fit individuals in any of these fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The description strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are common traits for vets and agricultural scientists.
* **Computer Science (0.4):** The puzzle-solving ability and affinity for abstract concepts are good indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science. However, the description lacks specific details that would more strongly suggest a computer science focus.
* **Business Administration (0.2):**  This field is less likely given the description. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the emphasis on nature and empathy points away from a typical business student profile. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid over-generalizing. These probabilities are based on limited information and common stereotypes.  There are many individuals passionate about nature who excel in computer science or business.
