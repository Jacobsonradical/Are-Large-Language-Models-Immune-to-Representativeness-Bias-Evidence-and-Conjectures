Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality description:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, interest in plants, empathy (especially towards animals), and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing these careers. 
* **Computer Science:**  While the "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence fit, the other traits are less specific to computer science. It's possible, but the description doesn't lean as heavily in this direction.
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the description. While intelligence is useful in business, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals doesn't align well with the common image of someone pursuing business administration.
