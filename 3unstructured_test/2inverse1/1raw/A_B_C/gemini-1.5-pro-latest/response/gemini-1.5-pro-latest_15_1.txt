**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field. The love for nature, animals, understanding of hard work, and even puzzle-solving (applicable to research) make this a likely fit for Adam.
* **Computer Science:** While not as strong a connection as the first, the "quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles" and "high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts" aspects fit some common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:**  This has the weakest connection.  The personality description doesn't highlight typical traits associated with business aspirations, such as leadership, competitiveness, or a strong interest in finance and markets. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on stereotypes. It's impossible to definitively say what Adam studied based solely on a personality sketch.
