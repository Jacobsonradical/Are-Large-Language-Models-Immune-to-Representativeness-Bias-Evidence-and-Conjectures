**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The sketch heavily emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work and dedication. These traits align strongly with agricultural and veterinary sciences, making it the most probable field for Adam. 

* **Computer science:** While the sketch mentions puzzle-solving and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science, it lacks strong indicators like a passion for technology or programming.  Therefore, the probability is moderate.

* **Business administration:** The sketch provides little to no correlation with typical characteristics associated with business administration, such as leadership, ambition for financial success, or interest in market dynamics. This makes it the least probable field for Adam.
