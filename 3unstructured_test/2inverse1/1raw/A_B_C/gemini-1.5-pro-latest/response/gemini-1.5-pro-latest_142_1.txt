Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The description strongly aligns with this field.  A love of nature, animals, understanding hard work (farming), and intelligence all fit the profile of someone drawn to these sciences.

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  While not as strong a connection, "enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are common traits in computer science students.  This field attracts a wide range of personalities, so it's still plausible.

* **Business Administration (0.1):** The personality sketch lacks traits typically associated with business aspirations, such as ambition, leadership, or an interest in finance/markets. While empathetic individuals can succeed in business, the overall profile makes this field less likely.
