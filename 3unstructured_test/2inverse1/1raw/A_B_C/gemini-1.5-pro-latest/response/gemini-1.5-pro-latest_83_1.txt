Here's my assessment of the probabilities, based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific understanding.  This aligns most closely with agricultural and veterinary sciences. 
* **Computer Science:**  The puzzle-solving aptitude and comfort with abstract concepts are common traits in computer science students. However, the sketch lacks a direct connection to technology or programming, making it slightly less likely.
* **Business Administration:**  The sketch doesn't mention typical business interests like finance, marketing, or leadership.  The emphasis on empathy and love for nature seems misaligned with common perceptions of the business world, making it the least likely field.
