Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love of nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work are all common traits for those drawn to these areas.
* **Computer Science (0.4):** While not as strong a connection as with agriculture, the "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence suggest a decent chance Adam could be in computer science.  Many in this field enjoy the problem-solving and abstract thinking it requires. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** This has the lowest probability. The sketch emphasizes empathy and a love for living things, which aren't as typical drivers for business-oriented individuals.  

**Important Note:** This is a subjective assessment based on limited information.  Personality sketches provide clues, but individual interests are diverse.
