Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind these are subjective estimates based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" also aligns with common perceptions of these fields. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):** The "puzzle-solving" aspect and "high intelligence/abstract concepts" fit the profile of someone in computer science. However, the other traits are less strong indicators compared to agricultural sciences.
* **Business Administration (0.2):**  The sketch provides little direct correlation to typical business administration traits.  While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, they are not as uniquely suggestive as the other fields.
