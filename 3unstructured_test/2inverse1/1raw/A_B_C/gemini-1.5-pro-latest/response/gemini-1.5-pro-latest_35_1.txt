Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, plants, and animals, coupled with empathy, suggests a potential interest in agriculture or animal care. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  While the description mentions "solving puzzles" and "understanding abstract concepts," which are relevant to computer science, there's no direct indication of an interest in technology or programming.  It's possible, but less likely than agricultural/veterinary sciences based on the information.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** This field is the least likely. The sketch emphasizes empathy, love for nature, and understanding hard work, which are not traits typically associated with a strong inclination towards business administration. 

**Important Note:** This is a subjective assessment based on limited information.  People's personalities and interests are complex, and many individuals in any field may not fit a stereotypical description.
