Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to animals and agriculture. 
* **Computer Science:** While not as strong a match as agricultural sciences, the description of being good at puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could point towards an affinity for computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely fit. The personality sketch doesn't highlight typical characteristics associated with business administration, such as an interest in finance, leadership, or marketing.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based solely on a brief personality sketch.  Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
