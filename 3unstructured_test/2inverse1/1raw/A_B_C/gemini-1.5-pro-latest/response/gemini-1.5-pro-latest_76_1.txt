Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those drawn to these fields. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):** The puzzle-solving ability and intelligence suggest an aptitude for computer science. However, the sketch lacks a direct mention of technology or programming, making it less certain.
* **Business Administration (0.2):** The sketch provides little evidence to suggest an inclination towards business administration. While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are valuable in business, the other traits are less characteristic of this field. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a brief personality sketch.  People are complex, and many individuals in any field may not fit a stereotypical profile.
