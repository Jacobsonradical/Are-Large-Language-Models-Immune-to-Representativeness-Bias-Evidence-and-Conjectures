Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests this field.  Love of nature, plants, animals, and an appreciation for hard work are all highly aligned with this area of study.

* **Computer Science:**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and high intelligence fit the profile of a computer science student.  However, the sketch lacks strong indicators like a passion for technology or programming.

* **Business Administration:**  This field is the least likely. The sketch emphasizes empathy and a love for nature, which are not traits typically associated with a strong focus on business.
