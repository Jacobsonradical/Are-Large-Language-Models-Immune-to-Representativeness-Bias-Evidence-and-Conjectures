Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. Combined with the mention of appreciating hard work (often associated with these fields), this makes Agricultural and Veterinary Science highly probable. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.  This field attracts individuals with high intelligence, making it a plausible option.
* **Business Administration:** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the core interests described don't align as strongly as they do with the other two fields. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on a personality sketch.  Many other factors (personal experiences, career goals, etc.) influence a person's field of study.
