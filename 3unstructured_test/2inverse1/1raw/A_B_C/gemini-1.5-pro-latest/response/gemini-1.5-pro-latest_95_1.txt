Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, curiosity about plants, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those drawn to agricultural and veterinary studies. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The puzzle-solving ability and aptitude for abstract concepts are good indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science. However, the sketch lacks a direct mention of technology or programming, which are more typical interests in this field.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The personality sketch offers little to suggest an inclination towards business administration.  While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business,  the other traits highlighted don't strongly correlate with this field.
