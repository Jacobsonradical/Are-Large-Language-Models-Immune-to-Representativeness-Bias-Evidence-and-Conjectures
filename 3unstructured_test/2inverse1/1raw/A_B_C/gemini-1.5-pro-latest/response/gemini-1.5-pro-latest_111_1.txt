Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The description strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work are all common traits in those drawn to these professions.
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  Intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and abstract thinking are strong indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science. However, the lack of specific mentions of technology or a passion for it makes the probability moderate.
* **Business Administration (0.2):**  While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business, the other traits are less stereotypical. The description doesn't suggest a strong interest in leadership, finance, or market dynamics, which are more typical of business students. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of a person's field of study.  Many other factors (interests, experiences, opportunities) influence career choices.
