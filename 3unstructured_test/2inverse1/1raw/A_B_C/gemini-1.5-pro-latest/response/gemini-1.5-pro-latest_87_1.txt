Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The personality sketch strongly aligns with this field. The love for nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in individuals drawn to these professions. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  While the description mentions puzzle-solving and understanding abstract concepts – traits often associated with computer science – the lack of any specific mention of technology or computers makes it less likely. It's still possible, as some people in computer science are drawn to the theoretical and problem-solving aspects.
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  This field is the least likely fit based on the description.  The sketch emphasizes empathy, a love for nature, and understanding hard work, which are not as strongly associated with typical business administration aspirations. 

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses.  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. People are diverse, and their interests often defy stereotypes.
