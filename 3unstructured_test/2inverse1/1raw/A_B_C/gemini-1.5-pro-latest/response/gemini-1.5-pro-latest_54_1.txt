Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly suggests this field.  The love for nature, plants, and animals, combined with empathy, aligns perfectly with these areas of study. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  While not as strong a fit as agricultural sciences, the "quiet, puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence suggest a possible affinity for computer science. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** This field is the least likely.  Nothing in the sketch directly points to interests in business, management, or finance. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, they aren't unique indicators.
