Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those drawn to these areas.
* **Computer Science:**  The "quiet, puzzle-solving" aspect does suggest a possible fit with computer science, which often attracts individuals with these characteristics.  High intelligence and abstract thinking are also valuable in this field.
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business, the other traits mentioned in the sketch are less common drivers for pursuing a business administration degree. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that personality sketches are limited. Many individuals in any field may share these traits, and there are many other factors influencing a person's choice of study.
