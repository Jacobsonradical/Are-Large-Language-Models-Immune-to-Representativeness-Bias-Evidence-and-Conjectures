Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific understanding in that realm. This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" the most likely field. 
* **Computer Science:**  The traits of puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence are common in computer science students. This field is moderately likely.
* **Business Administration:** The sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in business, finance, or management. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, they don't strongly point to this field. This makes it the least likely.
