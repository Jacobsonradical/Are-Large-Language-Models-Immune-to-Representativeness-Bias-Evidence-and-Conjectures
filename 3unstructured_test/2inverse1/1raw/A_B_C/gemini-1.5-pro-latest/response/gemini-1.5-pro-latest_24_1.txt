**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to fields involving nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. 

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** This field aligns most strongly with the description.  The love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing agricultural or veterinary careers. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** While not as strong a match as agricultural sciences, the "quiet boy" who enjoys "solving puzzles" and excels at "abstract concepts" could fit the profile of someone interested in computer science. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** This field has the weakest connection to the description. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the other traits don't point as directly to this field.
