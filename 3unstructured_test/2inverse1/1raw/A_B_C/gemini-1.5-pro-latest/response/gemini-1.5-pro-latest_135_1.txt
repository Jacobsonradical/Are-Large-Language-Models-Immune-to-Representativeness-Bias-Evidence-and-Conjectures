Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific understanding. This makes fields related to agriculture and animal care highly probable.
* **Business administration:**  The sketch lacks strong indicators of someone interested in the core aspects of business like finance, marketing, or management. While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, they aren't as specific to the field.
* **Computer science:** The puzzle-solving aspect and affinity for abstract concepts suggest potential interest in computer science.  However, the strong emphasis on nature and animals makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary sciences. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a personality sketch.  Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
