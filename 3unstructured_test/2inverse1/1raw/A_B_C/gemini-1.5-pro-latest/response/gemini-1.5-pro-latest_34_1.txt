Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests this field.  A love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work are all highly indicative of someone drawn to these fields.
* **Computer Science:** The puzzle-solving aptitude and abstract thinking mentioned align well with computer science. However, the lack of direct mention of technology makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
* **Business Administration:** The sketch provides little evidence to suggest an inclination towards business administration. The traits mentioned (empathy, love for animals) don't typically align as strongly with this field. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information. A person's field of study is complex and influenced by many factors not captured in a brief personality sketch.
