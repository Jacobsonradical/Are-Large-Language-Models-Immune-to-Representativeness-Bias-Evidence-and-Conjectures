Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch provided:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch heavily implies an affinity for nature ("genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" and "deep love for animals"). This aligns strongly with fields like agriculture or veterinary medicine.
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The traits "enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are often associated with computer science. While not as strong a connection as the first, it's still a plausible fit. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** The sketch doesn't offer strong indicators for a business inclination. While "understanding and appreciation for hard work" might apply, it's not specific enough to suggest a high probability.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions of these fields.  Many individuals in business administration might love nature, and many computer scientists might not enjoy puzzles. 
* **Individual Variation:**  Personalities are complex, and this sketch offers a limited view.  
* **Missing Information:** Knowing Adam's undergraduate major, hobbies, or career goals would drastically change these probabilities.
