Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The strongest correlation exists here.  The description emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work (common in agricultural settings). 
* **Computer Science:**  Intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking are common traits for computer scientists. However, the lack of direct mentions of technology or programming makes this less certain.
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest correlation.  While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the overall description points more strongly towards fields with a scientific or nature-oriented focus.
