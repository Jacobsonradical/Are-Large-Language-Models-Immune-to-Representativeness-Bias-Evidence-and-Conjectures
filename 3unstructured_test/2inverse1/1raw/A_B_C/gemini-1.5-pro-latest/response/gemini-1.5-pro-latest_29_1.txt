``` 

**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially hands-on work (appreciation for hard work and dedication). This points most heavily towards **agricultural and veterinary science**.

While **computer science** can attract individuals who enjoy problem-solving and abstract concepts, the lack of any mention of technology or computers makes it less likely.

**Business administration** seems the least probable, as the description lacks indicators of interest in finance, management, or commerce.
