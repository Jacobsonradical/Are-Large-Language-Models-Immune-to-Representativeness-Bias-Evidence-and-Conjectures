Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and veterinary science:** The sketch strongly suggests this field.  A love for nature, plants, and animals, combined with empathy, aligns perfectly.  
* **Computer science:** The "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence suggest a possible fit for computer science. This field often attracts individuals who enjoy abstract thinking.
* **Business administration:** The sketch provides little to connect with typical business administration traits.  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the other traits point more strongly towards other fields.
