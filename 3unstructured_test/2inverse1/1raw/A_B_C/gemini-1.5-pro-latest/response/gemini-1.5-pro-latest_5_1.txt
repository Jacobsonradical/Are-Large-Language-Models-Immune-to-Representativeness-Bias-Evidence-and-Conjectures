**Explanation:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific pursuits related to them.  Here's why I assigned these probabilities:

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** This is the most likely field given the explicit mention of "curiosity about nature and its various plants" and "deep love for animals." These align perfectly with this field.
* **Computer Science (0.3):**  While not as strong a match, "enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are traits often found in computer science students. There's a moderate chance Adam could be in this field.
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  The personality sketch provides little to no indication of interest in business, finance, or management, making this the least likely field for Adam.
