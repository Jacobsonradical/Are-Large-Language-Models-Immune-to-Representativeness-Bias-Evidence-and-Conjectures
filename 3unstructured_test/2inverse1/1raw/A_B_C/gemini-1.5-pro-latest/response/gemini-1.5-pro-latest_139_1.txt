Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6):** The description heavily emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work/dedication. These traits align strongly with someone interested in agriculture or veterinary medicine.

* **Computer Science (0.3):**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and "high intelligence/abstract concepts" are common traits in computer science students. However, the other traits are not as strong of indicators, making it less likely than agricultural/veterinary science.

* **Business Administration (0.1):** The personality sketch lacks typical traits associated with business administration, such as ambition, leadership, competitiveness, or strong interest in economics/finance.  The described empathy could be valuable in business, but overall it's the least likely fit.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. Many other factors influence career choices.
