Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (Highest Probability):**  The description aligns strongly with this field: 
    * "Curiosity about nature and plants" is a direct fit.
    * "Love for animals" is almost essential for veterinary science.
    * "Understanding and appreciation for hard work" is common in agricultural fields.

* **Computer Science (Moderate Probability):**
    * "Enjoys solving puzzles" and "high intelligence/abstract concepts" are strong indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science. 

* **Business Administration (Lowest Probability):** 
    *  The sketch lacks traits often associated with business aspirations (e.g., leadership, ambition, risk-taking).  While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, they aren't as uniquely suggestive as the traits linked to the other fields. 
 
**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a personality sketch.  People are complex, and there's always a chance Adam could be drawn to a field that doesn't perfectly match this brief description.
