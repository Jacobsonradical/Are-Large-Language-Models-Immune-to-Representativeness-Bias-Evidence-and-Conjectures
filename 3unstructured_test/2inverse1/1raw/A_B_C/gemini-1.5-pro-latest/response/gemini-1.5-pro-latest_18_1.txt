Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, animals, and understanding hard work are common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care. 
* **Computer Science:** While intelligence and abstract thinking are common in computer science, the other traits (love of nature, empathy) are less central. It's possible, but the sketch doesn't scream "computer scientist."
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely. The sketch emphasizes empathy and a love for nature, which aren't stereotypical traits associated with business-focused individuals.

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes.  Many individuals in each field might possess the described traits.
