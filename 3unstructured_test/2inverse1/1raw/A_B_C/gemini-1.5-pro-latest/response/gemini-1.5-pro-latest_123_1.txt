Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with the appreciation for hard work, strongly suggests a field related to agriculture or veterinary science.

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The description of enjoying puzzles and being good with abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.  High intelligence is also common in this field. However, the lack of direct mentions of technology or programming makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.

* **Business Administration (0.1):** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest a leaning towards business. While empathy and understanding hard work are relevant to business, the other traits point more strongly towards fields focused on nature and problem-solving.
