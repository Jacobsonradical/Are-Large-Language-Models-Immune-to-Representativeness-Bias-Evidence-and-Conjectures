Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, animals, empathy, and understanding hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care. This gets the highest probability.

* **Computer Science:**  Intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science.  While not as strong a match as the agricultural field, these traits make it a reasonable possibility.

* **Business Administration:** The sketch offers little direct correlation to business administration.  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, there's nothing to suggest a particular interest in the field. This receives the lowest probability.
