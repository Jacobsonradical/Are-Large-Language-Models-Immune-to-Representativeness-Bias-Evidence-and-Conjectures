Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with the appreciation for hard work, aligns strongly with someone pursuing agricultural or veterinary studies. 

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The description of Adam enjoying puzzles and being good with abstract concepts suggests a potential fit for computer science.  High intelligence is common in this field. However, the lack of any specific mention of technology or computers makes it less certain than agricultural/veterinary science.

* **Business Administration (0.1):**  The personality sketch provides little to no direct correlation with typical traits associated with business administration. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the other descriptors point more strongly towards fields focused on nature or analytical problem-solving.
