Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature ("genuine curiosity about plants", "deep love for animals"). This makes a field related to agriculture or animal care highly probable.
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The description of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with skills valued in computer science. However, the sketch lacks a direct indicator of interest in technology or programming.
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While "understanding hard work and dedication" could apply to business, the other traits don't strongly suggest an inclination towards this field. The sketch lacks typical business-oriented markers like leadership, ambition for financial success, or interest in markets. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on limited information.  Personality sketches provide clues, but individual interests and career choices are complex.
