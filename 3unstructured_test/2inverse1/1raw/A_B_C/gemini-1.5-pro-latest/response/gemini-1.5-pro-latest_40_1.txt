**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch heavily emphasizes traits often associated with individuals drawn to biological sciences and animal care:

* **"Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants"**:  Strongly suggests an interest in botany or related fields.
* **"Deep love for animals"**: A key motivator for pursuing veterinary science. 
* **"Warm heart, strong empathy"**: Desirable traits for those working closely with animals and potentially in animal healthcare.

While intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities are valuable in all fields, the specific combination of traits makes "agricultural and veterinary science" the most likely field for Adam.

**Here's why the other probabilities are lower:**

* **Computer Science (0.3):** While problem-solving is central to computer science, the sketch lacks strong indicators of interest in technology, programming, or abstract systems often associated with the field.
* **Business Administration (0.2):**  The sketch doesn't highlight traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, risk-taking, financial acumen, or strong interpersonal/persuasion skills.
