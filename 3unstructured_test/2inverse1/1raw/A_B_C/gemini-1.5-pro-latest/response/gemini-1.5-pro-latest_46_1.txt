Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes associated with the fields and the personality description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work are common traits among those drawn to these fields. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** While not as strong a match as Agricultural Science, the "quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles" and "high intelligence/abstract concepts" are suggestive of someone who might be interested in computer science. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):** This personality sketch doesn't have many hallmarks typically associated with business administration. While intelligence is useful in business, the other traits are less stereotypical.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information and stereotypes.  Many individuals in each field defy these common assumptions.
