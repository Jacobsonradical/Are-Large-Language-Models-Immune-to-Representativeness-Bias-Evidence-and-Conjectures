Here's an estimated probability breakdown, based on the personality description:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  This, combined with the appreciation for hard work, makes agricultural or veterinary science highly probable. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** The description mentions intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts, traits often associated with computer science. However, the lack of any direct connection to technology makes it less likely than agricultural/veterinary science.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The sketch provides little to no indication of interest in business, finance, or management. While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, the other traits make this field the least likely.
