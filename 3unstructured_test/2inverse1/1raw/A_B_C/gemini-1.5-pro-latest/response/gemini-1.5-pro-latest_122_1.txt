Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests this field.  The emphasis on nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work aligns perfectly with these areas of study. 
* **Computer Science:** The "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence hint at computer science.  It's a field that attracts abstract thinkers. However, the other traits are not as strong of indicators as they are for agricultural sciences.
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely.  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks indicators of a strong interest in economics, management, or finance â€“ typical focuses within business administration programs.
