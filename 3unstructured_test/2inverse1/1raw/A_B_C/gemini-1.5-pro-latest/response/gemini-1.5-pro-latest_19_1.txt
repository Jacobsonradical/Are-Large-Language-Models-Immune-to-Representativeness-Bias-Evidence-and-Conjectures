Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, plants, animals, and understanding of hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  While the sketch doesn't directly point to computer science, the emphasis on problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are often found in individuals drawn to this field.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The sketch provides little to suggest an inclination towards business administration. The traits mentioned (empathy, love for nature, etc.) aren't typically emphasized in this field.

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on general personality tendencies. Individual variations within each field are vast, and this sketch shouldn't be considered a definitive predictor of someone's academic pursuit.
