Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with the appreciation for hard work and dedication, makes a strong case for fields related to agriculture or animal care. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** While not as strong a match as the first, the mention of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could suggest an affinity for computer science. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  The sketch doesn't offer much to connect with business administration. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in many fields, they don't specifically point towards this area.

**Important Note:** These are simply probabilities based on limited information.  Individual interests and career paths are complex. There are many reasons why Adam could be in any of these fields.
