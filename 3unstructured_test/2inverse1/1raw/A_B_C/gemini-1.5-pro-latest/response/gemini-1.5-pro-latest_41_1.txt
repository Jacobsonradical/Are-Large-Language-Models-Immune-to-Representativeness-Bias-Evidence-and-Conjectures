Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests this field.  Love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all highly aligned with this area.
* **Computer Science:**  While not as strong a match as Agricultural Science, the "quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles" and intelligence suggest a possible fit with computer science.  Abstract thinking is also crucial in this field.
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely. The sketch doesn't highlight traits typically associated with business, such as ambition for leadership or interest in financial markets. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a brief sketch.  Many other factors influence a person's choice of field.
