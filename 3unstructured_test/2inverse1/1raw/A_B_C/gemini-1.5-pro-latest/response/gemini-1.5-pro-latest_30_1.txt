Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The strongest correlation exists here.  A love for nature, plants, and animals aligns perfectly with these fields. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  Puzzle-solving abilities and understanding of abstract concepts are common in computer science students. While the description doesn't explicitly mention technology, these traits suggest a reasonable likelihood.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The sketch provides little evidence to suggest an inclination towards business. While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, the other traits are less indicative. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for this personality.
