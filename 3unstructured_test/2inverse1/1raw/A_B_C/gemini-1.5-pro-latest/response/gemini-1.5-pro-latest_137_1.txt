Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly suggests this field.  A love for nature, animals, and understanding plants aligns perfectly. The mention of "hard work and dedication" also fits the image of these fields. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence point towards a possible aptitude for computer science. Understanding "abstract concepts" further supports this. However, the description lacks the strong connection to technology or systems often associated with computer science students.
* **Business Administration (0.2):** This field is least likely. The sketch emphasizes empathy, a love for nature, and understanding hard work â€“ traits not as directly associated with the core focus of business administration programs. 

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses. Personality sketches, while helpful, are not foolproof predictors of a person's field of study. Many individuals have interests and talents that span multiple disciplines.
