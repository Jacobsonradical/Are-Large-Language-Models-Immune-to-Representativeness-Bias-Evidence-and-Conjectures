Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is most suggestive of a career related to nature:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7", 
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, animals, understanding hard work, and intelligence all fit the profile of someone drawn to these areas.

* **Business Administration:** This is the least likely. The sketch lacks traits often associated with business aspirations, such as ambition, leadership, and a focus on profit or efficiency.

* **Computer Science:**  While not as strong a match as agricultural sciences, the puzzle-solving skills and ability with abstract concepts could suggest an aptitude for computer science. Some individuals in this field are drawn to it by a sense of intellectual curiosity rather than purely financial motivations.
