Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):** While the sketch doesn't directly scream "computer science," the emphasis on intelligence, problem-solving (puzzles), and understanding abstract concepts fits the profile of many in this field.
* **Business Administration (0.2):** This is given the lowest probability. The sketch lacks typical indicators associated with business aspirations, such as an interest in finance, leadership, or market trends. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that personality sketches are not foolproof predictors of a person's field of study.  People are diverse, and these are just educated guesses based on common stereotypes.
