Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. These are core interests for individuals in agricultural and veterinary fields, making it the most likely match. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):** The description of Adam enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. This field attracts individuals with strong analytical and problem-solving skills. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, marketing, or management â€“  typical business administration focuses. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong generalizations.  Personality traits are not exclusive to any field, and many people in each field defy stereotypes. This is simply a probabilistic interpretation based on the provided information.
