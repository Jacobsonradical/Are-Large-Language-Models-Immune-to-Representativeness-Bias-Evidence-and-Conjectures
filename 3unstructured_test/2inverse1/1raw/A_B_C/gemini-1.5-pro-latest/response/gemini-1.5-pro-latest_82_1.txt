Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the description could fit students in any of these fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The description strongly aligns with this field.  A love for nature, animals, and an appreciation for hard work are common traits in these areas.
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence suggest a fit for computer science. However, the lack of explicit mention of technology or programming makes it less certain. 
* **Business Administration (0.2):** This has the lowest probability. While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are relevant, the description lacks typical business-oriented traits like ambition, leadership, or interest in finance. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of academic fields. Many other factors influence a person's choice of study.
