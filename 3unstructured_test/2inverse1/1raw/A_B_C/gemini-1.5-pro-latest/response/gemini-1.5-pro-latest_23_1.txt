Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  A love for nature, animals, and an understanding of hard work are common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and veterinary medicine.
* **Computer Science (0.4):** While the sketch doesn't directly point to computer science, the "enjoying puzzles" and "understanding abstract concepts" aspects suggest a predisposition for logical thinking often found in computer science students.
* **Business Administration (0.2):** The sketch provides little evidence to suggest an inclination towards business administration. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the other traits are less typical of this field. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these probabilities are based on limited information and stereotypes.  Many individuals in each field defy these generalizations.
