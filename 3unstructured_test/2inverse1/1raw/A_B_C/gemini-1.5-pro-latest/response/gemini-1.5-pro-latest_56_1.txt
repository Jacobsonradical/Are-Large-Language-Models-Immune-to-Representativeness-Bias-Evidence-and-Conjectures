Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind that this is based on a personality sketch and stereotypes, and not on actual data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and understanding living things. This aligns very well with fields like agriculture and veterinary science. 
* **Computer Science:** While not as strong a match as the first, the "puzzles" and "abstract concepts" aspects suggest a mind that might enjoy computer science. It's a plausible fit, hence a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration:** The sketch provides very little to connect with a typical business administration personality.  Empathy and a warm heart might be found in this field, but the other traits aren't strong indicators. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that these are just educated guesses. People's personalities are complex, and their chosen fields of study don't always perfectly reflect those complexities.
