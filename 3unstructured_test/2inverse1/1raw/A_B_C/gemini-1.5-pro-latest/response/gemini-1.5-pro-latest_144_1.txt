Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care.
* **Computer Science:** While intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities are common in computer science students, the sketch lacks strong indicators like a passion for technology or programming.  It's possible, but less likely based on the information.
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely. The sketch emphasizes empathy and a connection to nature, which aren't as strongly associated with typical business motivations. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes.  An individual's personality is complex, and people from diverse backgrounds can thrive in any field.
