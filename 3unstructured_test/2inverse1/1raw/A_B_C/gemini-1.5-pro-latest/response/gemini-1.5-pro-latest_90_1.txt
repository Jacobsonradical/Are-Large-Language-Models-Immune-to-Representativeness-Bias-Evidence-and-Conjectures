Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose guidelines based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, animals, understanding hard work (farming), and potentially applying scientific knowledge make this a high probability.

* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" and "abstract concepts" aspects fit the profile of someone interested in computer science, the other traits (love of nature, empathy) are less typical.  It's possible, but less likely than agricultural science based on the description.

* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the personality sketch.  While intelligence and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the other traits aren't as strong of indicators.
