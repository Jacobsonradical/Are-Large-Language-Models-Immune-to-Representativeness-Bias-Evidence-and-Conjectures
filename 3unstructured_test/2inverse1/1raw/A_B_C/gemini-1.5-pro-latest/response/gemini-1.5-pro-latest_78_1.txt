Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and some very general statistics:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  A love for nature, plants, and animals, along with empathy, are all traits commonly associated with people drawn to these professions. 

* **Computer Science (0.3):**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence suggest a possible aptitude for computer science. It's a field that attracts logical and abstract thinkers. However, the other traits aren't as strong of indicators compared to agricultural sciences.

* **Business Administration (0.2):** While intelligence is valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of traits often associated with business aspirations, such as leadership, risk-taking, or a strong interest in finance and economics. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Personality isn't a perfect predictor:**  People's interests and career choices are complex.  Personality is just one factor.
* **Limited information:** We know very little about Adam beyond this sketch.
* **Graduate student demographics:** The overall proportion of graduate students in each field within the U.S. would also play a role, but we don't have that data.
