Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care. 
* **Computer Science:** While the "puzzle-solving" aspect and high intelligence could point towards computer science, the other traits (love for animals, nature) are less typical drivers for this field.
* **Business Administration:** The sketch provides little evidence to suggest an inclination towards business administration.  The traits mentioned don't strongly correlate with this field. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a brief sketch. Individual personalities and career choices are complex, and many other factors influence a person's field of study.
