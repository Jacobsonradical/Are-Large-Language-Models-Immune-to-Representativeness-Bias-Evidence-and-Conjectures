Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love of nature, animals, and understanding hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care. 

* **Computer Science (0.4):** While the description doesn't directly scream "computer science," the emphasis on puzzle-solving skills and understanding abstract concepts are definitely applicable. It's plausible Adam could be drawn to the problem-solving nature of computer science.

* **Business Administration (0.2):** This receives the lowest probability. The personality sketch lacks traits often associated with business aspirations, such as a drive for leadership, strong communication skills, or a focus on financial success. While empathetic individuals can succeed in business, the core description doesn't point strongly in this direction.

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on common stereotypes. People are diverse, and an individual's personality doesn't dictate their field of study.
