Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, interest in plants, empathy (especially for animals), and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those drawn to these professions. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):** The "puzzle-solving" aspect and high intelligence are common traits for computer science students. However, the other descriptors (nature, empathy, animals) are less typical focal points for this field.
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  The personality sketch provides little indication of an inclination towards business or administration. While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the other traits are not as strongly associated with this field. 

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many other factors influence a person's choice of study, and there are always exceptions to general trends.
