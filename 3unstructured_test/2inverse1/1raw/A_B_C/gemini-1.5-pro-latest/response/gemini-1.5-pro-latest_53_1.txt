Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a personality sketch and contains inherent biases:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love for nature, animals, understanding hard work (farming), and intelligence all fit the profile of someone drawn to these sciences. 
* **Computer Science:** While intelligence and puzzle-solving are associated with computer science, the other traits are less specific. It's plausible, but less likely than agricultural sciences based on the description.
* **Business Administration:**  This is the least likely fit. The sketch lacks typical business-oriented traits like ambition, leadership, or risk-taking. While someone empathetic could go into ethical business practices, the overall profile doesn't point strongly towards this field. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study. Many other factors influence career choices.
