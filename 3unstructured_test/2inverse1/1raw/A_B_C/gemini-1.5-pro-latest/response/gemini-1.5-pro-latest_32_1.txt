Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The description aligns strongly with this field:
    * "Curiosity about nature and plants" is fundamental.
    * "Love for animals" is almost essential for veterinary paths.
    * "Understanding and appreciation for hard work" fits the agricultural aspect. 

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  There's a moderate chance:
    * "Enjoys solving puzzles" and "high intelligence, good with abstract concepts" are common traits in computer science students. 
    * However, the description lacks specific markers (interest in technology, programming, etc.) that would make it a stronger fit.

* **Business Administration (0.1):** This is the least likely:
    * The personality sketch doesn't highlight traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, ambition for financial success, or strong interpersonal/persuasion skills. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  A person's true interests and field of study are complex and can't be fully determined by a short personality sketch.
