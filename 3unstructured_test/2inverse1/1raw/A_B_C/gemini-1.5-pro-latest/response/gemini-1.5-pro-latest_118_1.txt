Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch heavily emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with the mention of hard work and dedication, strongly suggests a field related to agriculture or animal care. 
* **Computer Science (0.3):** The description of Adam enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could point towards an aptitude for computer science. However, the lack of any direct mention of technology or programming makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** There's little in the sketch to connect Adam to business administration. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the other traits point more strongly towards different fields. 

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch. There's not enough information for a definitive answer. Adam's actual field of study could be something entirely different!
