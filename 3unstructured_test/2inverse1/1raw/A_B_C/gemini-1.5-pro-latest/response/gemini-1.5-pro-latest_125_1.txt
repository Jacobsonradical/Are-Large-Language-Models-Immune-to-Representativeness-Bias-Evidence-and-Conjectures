Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work are all highly consistent with someone pursuing this path. 
* **Computer Science:**  Intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts are good indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science.  This field is fairly popular, making it a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration:** The sketch provides little direct evidence to suggest an inclination towards business administration. While intelligence and empathy can be beneficial in this field, they aren't specific enough to warrant a high probability.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are subjective estimations based on limited information. It's impossible to definitively say what field Adam was in without more data.
