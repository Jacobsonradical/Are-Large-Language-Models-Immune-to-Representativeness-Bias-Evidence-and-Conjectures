Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The description aligns strongly with this field.  The love for nature, plants, and animals, combined with an appreciation for hard work, makes this a very likely fit.

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The puzzle-solving ability and comfort with abstract concepts are common traits in computer science students. However, the other characteristics (love of nature, empathy) are less directly related to the field, making it a moderate probability.

* **Business Administration (0.2):**  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business aspirations (e.g., leadership, risk-taking, financial interest). This makes it the least likely fit.
