Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in this area. 
* **Computer Science:**  While not as direct a match, the "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence suggest a good fit for computer science. This field also attracts individuals who appreciate abstract concepts.
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the personality description.  While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in business or finance. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on a limited personality sketch. Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
