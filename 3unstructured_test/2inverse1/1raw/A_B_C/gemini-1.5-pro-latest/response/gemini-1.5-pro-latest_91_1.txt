Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality description:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  The strongest correlation exists here.  The description explicitly mentions "curiosity about nature and its various plants" and a "deep love for animals." These traits are highly suggestive of someone drawn to this field. 
* **Computer Science (0.4):** The description mentions "enjoys solving puzzles" and "good at understanding abstract concepts," which are aligned with computer science. However, the lack of direct references to technology or programming makes this a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration (0.1):**  The personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business. While "understanding and appreciation for hard work" could apply, the other traits (love for animals, curiosity about nature) are less common drivers for this field.
