Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, animals, understanding hard work (farming), and intelligence all point towards this being a highly probable field for Adam.

* **Computer Science:**  While not as strong a fit as agricultural sciences, the "puzzle-solving" aspect and high intelligence are common traits for those in computer science. It's plausible, hence a moderate probability.

* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely. The sketch emphasizes empathy and love for nature, which are not traits traditionally associated with business administration. While intelligent people exist in all fields, the other characteristics make this a less probable fit.
