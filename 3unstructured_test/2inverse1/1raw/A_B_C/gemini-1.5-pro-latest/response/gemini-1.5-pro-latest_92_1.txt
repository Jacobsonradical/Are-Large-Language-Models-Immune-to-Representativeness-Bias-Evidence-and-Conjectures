Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests this field.  Love of nature, plants, animals, and an appreciation for hard work align perfectly with this area of study. 
* **Computer Science:**  The "puzzle-solving" aspect and mention of "abstract concepts" could point towards computer science. It's a likely field for someone with high intelligence.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators that would make this field highly probable. 

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for this personality.
