Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in those pursuing these careers. 
* **Computer Science:**  While not as direct a match as agricultural sciences, the "puzzle-solving" aspect and "high intelligence/abstract concepts" are common in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the sketch. While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, the description doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards this field.

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on personality tendencies. Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
