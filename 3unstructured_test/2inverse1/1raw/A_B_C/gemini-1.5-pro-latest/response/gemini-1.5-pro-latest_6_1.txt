Here's my assessment of the probabilities, based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description heavily leans towards this field.  The emphasis on nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work aligns strongly with these areas of study. 
* **Computer Science:** While not as strong a fit as Agricultural Science, the mention of "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts" suggests a possibility of interest in computer science. 
* **Business Administration:**  The personality sketch doesn't offer strong indicators aligning with a typical business administration student. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the other traits mentioned point more strongly towards other fields.
