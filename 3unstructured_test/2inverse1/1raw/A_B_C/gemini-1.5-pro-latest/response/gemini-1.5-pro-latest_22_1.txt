Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with the appreciation for hard work (often associated with these fields), makes it the most likely field for Adam.

* **Computer Science:** The sketch mentions enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, traits often associated with computer science. This makes it a plausible, though less likely, field compared to agricultural and veterinary science. 

* **Business Administration:**  The personality sketch doesn't offer strong indicators aligning with a typical business administration student. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the other traits make this the least likely field for Adam.
