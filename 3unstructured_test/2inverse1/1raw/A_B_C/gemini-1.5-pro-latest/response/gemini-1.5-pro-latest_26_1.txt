Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, plants, and animals.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" also aligns well with these fields. This makes it the most likely area of study for Adam.
* **Computer Science:**  While not as strong a fit as the first, the puzzle-solving ability and intelligence suggest a possible aptitude for computer science.  Many in this field also appreciate abstract concepts.
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the personality sketch. While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, the core interests described don't align well.
