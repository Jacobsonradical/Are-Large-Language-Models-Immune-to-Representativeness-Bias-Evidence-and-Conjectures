Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly suggests an affinity for nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with the mention of "hard work and dedication" (often associated with these fields), makes this the most likely area of study for Adam.

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his ability to grasp abstract concepts are good indicators of a potential interest in computer science. This field attracts individuals with strong problem-solving skills.

* **Business Administration (0.1):** The sketch doesn't offer strong indicators of an interest in business administration. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in this field, the other traits point more strongly towards the other two options.
