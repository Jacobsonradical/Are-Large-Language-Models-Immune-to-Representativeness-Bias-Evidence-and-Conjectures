Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  The description strongly aligns with this field.  The love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are all common traits in those pursuing careers related to animals and agriculture. This gets the highest probability.

* **Computer Science:**  While the description mentions "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts," which are relevant to computer science,  the lack of any specific mention of technology or programming makes it less likely than agricultural and veterinary science. 

* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely.  The personality sketch focuses on empathy, nature, and animals, which are not traits typically associated with a strong inclination towards business administration.
