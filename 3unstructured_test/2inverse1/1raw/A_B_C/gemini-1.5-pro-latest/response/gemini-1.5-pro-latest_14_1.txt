Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals.  This, combined with the appreciation for hard work, makes a career in agricultural or veterinary science highly probable. 
* **Computer Science:**  The sketch mentions puzzle-solving and understanding abstract concepts, traits often associated with computer science. This makes it a moderate possibility.
* **Business Administration:** The personality description doesn't align as strongly with common perceptions of business administration.  While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the other traits point more definitively toward the other fields.
