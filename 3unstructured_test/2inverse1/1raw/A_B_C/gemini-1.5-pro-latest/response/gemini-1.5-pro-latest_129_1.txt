**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description aligns strongly with this field. The sketch emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals, along with an appreciation for hard work â€“ all common traits in those pursuing agricultural or veterinary careers. 
* **Computer Science:** While not as strong a match as agricultural science, the "quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles" and "high intelligence" elements suggest a possible fit with computer science.  Many in this field are drawn to its problem-solving and abstract thinking aspects.
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the personality sketch. There's little mention of typical business interests like finance, marketing, or management. While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business, they aren't specific enough to suggest a strong likelihood.
