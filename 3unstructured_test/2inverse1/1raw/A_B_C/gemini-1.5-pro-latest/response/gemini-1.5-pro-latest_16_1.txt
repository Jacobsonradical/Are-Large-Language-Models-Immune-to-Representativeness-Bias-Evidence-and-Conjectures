Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The description strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are common traits in those pursuing careers related to agriculture and animal care. 
* **Computer Science:** While the description mentions intelligence and abstract thinking (relevant to computer science), there's no direct mention of technology or programming. It's possible, but less likely based on the provided information.
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely. The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for nature, and understanding hard work, which are not stereotypical traits associated with business administration. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and generalizations. People's personalities and career choices are complex, and this sketch doesn't provide a complete picture.
