Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly suggests this field.  A love for nature, plants, animals, and an understanding of hard work are all highly compatible with these disciplines. 
* **Computer Science:** While not as strong a match, the "puzzle-solving" aspect and intelligence align with traits often found in computer science students. It's plausible, hence a moderate probability.
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely. The sketch emphasizes empathy and a connection to the natural world, traits not typically emphasized in business programs. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on stereotypes.  People are diverse, and someone with this personality could thrive in any of these fields.
