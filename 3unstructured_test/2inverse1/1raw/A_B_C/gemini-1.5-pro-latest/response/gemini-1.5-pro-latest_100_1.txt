Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, plants, and animals.  The mention of "hard work and dedication" aligns well with these fields. This makes it the most likely field for Adam.

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The description of Adam enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts points towards an affinity for logical thinking often found in computer science students. However, the other traits are less strong indicators compared to agricultural sciences.

* **Business Administration (0.2):** The sketch provides little direct evidence to suggest an interest in business administration. While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, they are not as specific to the field as the traits linking Adam to the other two options.
