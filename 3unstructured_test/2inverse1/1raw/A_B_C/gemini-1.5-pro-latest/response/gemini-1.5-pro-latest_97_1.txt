Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**  The sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific understanding. This makes agricultural and veterinary science a highly probable field for Adam.
* **Computer Science:**  While not as strong a connection as with agriculture/veterinary science, the sketch mentions "solving puzzles" and understanding "abstract concepts," which are relevant to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** This field has the weakest connection to the personality sketch. There's little direct indication of interest in business, finance, or management.  

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on limited information. People's personalities and interests are complex, and there's overlap between fields. Adam could be drawn to interdisciplinary studies that combine aspects of these areas.
