Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly emphasizes a love for nature, plants, and animals. This, combined with the appreciation for hard work, makes a field related to agriculture or animal care highly likely.
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  The description of the subject enjoying puzzles and being good with abstract concepts aligns well with a computer science student.  High intelligence is also common in this field. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):** The sketch doesn't offer strong indicators for a business inclination. While intelligence and empathy can be found in any field, they are not as specifically suggestive of business administration. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on stereotypes associated with the fields.  An individual's personality doesn't dictate their field of study in a definitive way.
