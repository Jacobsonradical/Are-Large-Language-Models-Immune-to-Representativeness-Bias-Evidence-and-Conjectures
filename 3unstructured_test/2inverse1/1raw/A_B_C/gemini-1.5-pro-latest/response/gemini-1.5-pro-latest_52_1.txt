Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is quite open to interpretation:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly emphasizes nature, plants, animals, and understanding hard work/dedication. These fit very well with someone in this field, hence the highest probability.
* **Computer Science:**  Intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking are linked to computer science. However, the sketch lacks a strong indicator of typical CS interests like technology or coding. 
* **Business Administration:** This field is the least likely. The sketch lacks typical business-oriented traits like leadership, ambition, or risk-taking. Empathy and a love for animals aren't strong indicators for this field. 

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses. Many individuals in each field wouldn't fit the personality sketch, and many people fitting the sketch might be in completely different fields.  Personality isn't a perfect predictor of career choice.
