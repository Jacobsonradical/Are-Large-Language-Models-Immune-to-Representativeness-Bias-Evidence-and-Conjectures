**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly suggests someone drawn to nature, animals, and potentially scientific inquiry. This makes "agricultural and veterinary science" the most probable field for Adam.

While the description mentions intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to "computer science", the emphasis on nature and animals makes it less likely than a field directly related to those interests.

"Business administration" seems the least likely fit.  The sketch lacks indicators of someone interested in business, finance, or management, focusing instead on personal qualities and scientific curiosity.
