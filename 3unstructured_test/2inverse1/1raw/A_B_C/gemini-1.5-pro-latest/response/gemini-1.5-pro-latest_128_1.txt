Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  The love for nature, plants, and animals, coupled with empathy, makes this a highly probable field for Adam. 
* **Computer Science:**  The puzzle-solving ability and understanding of abstract concepts are good indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science. This field attracts individuals with a diverse range of interests, so the other traits aren't unusual.
* **Business Administration:** The sketch provides the least support for this field. While intelligence and work ethic are valuable in business, the other traits are less typical of someone primarily driven by business pursuits.
