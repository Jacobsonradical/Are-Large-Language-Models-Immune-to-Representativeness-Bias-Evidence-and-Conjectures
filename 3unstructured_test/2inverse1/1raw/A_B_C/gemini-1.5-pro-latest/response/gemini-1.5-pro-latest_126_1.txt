Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** The sketch strongly aligns with this field.  Love of nature, animals, understanding hard work, and intelligence all fit the profile of someone drawn to these areas.
* **Computer Science (0.4):**  Puzzle-solving skills and understanding abstract concepts are common in computer science. While the sketch lacks direct mentions of technology, these traits suggest a moderate likelihood.
* **Business Administration (0.2):** This receives the lowest probability. The sketch emphasizes empathy and a connection to nature, which are not stereotypical traits associated with business administration. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  People are diverse, and a personality sketch doesn't definitively determine someone's field of study.
