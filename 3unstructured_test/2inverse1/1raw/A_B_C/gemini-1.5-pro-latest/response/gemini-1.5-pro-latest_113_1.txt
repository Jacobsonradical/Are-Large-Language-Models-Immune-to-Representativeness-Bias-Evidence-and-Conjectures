Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8):** The description aligns *strongly* with this field: 
    * "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" is a core interest for those in agriculture or botany.
    * "Deep love for animals" points towards veterinary science.
    * "Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication" fits the demanding nature of these fields. 

* **Computer Science (0.4):**  While not as strong a match as Agricultural Science, there are overlapping elements:
    * "Enjoys solving puzzles" and "high intelligence... good at understanding abstract concepts" are common traits among computer science students.

* **Business Administration (0.1):** The personality sketch provides little indication of interest in business, finance, or management. The traits mentioned (empathy, love for animals, nature) are not as directly applicable to this field compared to the others.
