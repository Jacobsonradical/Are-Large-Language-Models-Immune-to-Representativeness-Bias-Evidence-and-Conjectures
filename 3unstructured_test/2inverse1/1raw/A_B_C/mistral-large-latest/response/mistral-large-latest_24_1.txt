Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with skills needed for computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals suggests this might not be the best fit.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): This field aligns strongly with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. These traits suggest a high probability that the sketch is about Adam if he were in this field.
- Business Administration (0.3): While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's little in the sketch to suggest a strong fit with business administration. His quiet nature, curiosity about nature, and love for animals don't typically correlate with this field.
