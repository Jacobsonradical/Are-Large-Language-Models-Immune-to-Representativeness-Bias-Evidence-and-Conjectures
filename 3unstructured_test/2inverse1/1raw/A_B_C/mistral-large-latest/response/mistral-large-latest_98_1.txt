{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the highest probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills also align well with computer science, but to a lesser degree than agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business administration is less likely, given the subject's interests and personality traits, but still possible, hence a lower but non-zero probability.
