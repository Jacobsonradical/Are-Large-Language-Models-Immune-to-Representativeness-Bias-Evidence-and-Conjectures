```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, making it the most probable.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject is intelligent and appreciates hard work, there are no specific indicators pointing towards an interest in business, making it the least probable.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could relate to this field, but it's not as strongly indicated as the interest in nature and animals.
