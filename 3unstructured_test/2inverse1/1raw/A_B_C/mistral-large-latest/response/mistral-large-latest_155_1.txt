Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with skills needed for computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals is less typical of computer science students.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy strongly suggest a good fit with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business Administration (0.3): While Adam's understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business administration, the other aspects of the personality sketch do not closely align with this field.
