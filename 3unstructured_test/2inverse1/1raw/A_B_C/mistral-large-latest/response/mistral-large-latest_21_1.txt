}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences, hence the highest probability.
- The subject's intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could indicate a good fit for computer science, but the personality sketch does not emphasize technological interests.
- Business administration is less likely based on the given traits, as there's no mention of leadership, management, or entrepreneurial skills, but it's still possible due to the subject's intelligence and appreciation for hard work.
