Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with skills needed for computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals is less typical of computer science students.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy strongly suggest he could be studying agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with these fields.
- Business Administration (0.3): While Adam's high intelligence could be applicable to business administration, the personality sketch does not mention any interest in business, leadership, or management topics, making this field less likely.
