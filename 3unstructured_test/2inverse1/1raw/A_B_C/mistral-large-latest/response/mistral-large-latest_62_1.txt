Explanation:
- The subject's interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as their strong empathy, aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the highest probability.
- Their aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests they could also fit well in computer science, but with a lower probability than agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business administration seems the least likely fit given the personality sketch, as it does not mention any interests or traits that would specifically draw the subject to this field.
