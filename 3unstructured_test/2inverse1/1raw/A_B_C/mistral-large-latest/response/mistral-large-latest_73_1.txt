Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high probability.
- The subject's quiet nature, enjoyment of puzzles, and high intelligence could fit well in computer science, but the personality sketch doesn't emphasize technological interests, hence the moderate probability.
- The subject's traits do not seem to align particularly well with business administration, as there's no mention of leadership, management, or entrepreneurial skills, hence the lower probability.
