Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align most closely with the agricultural and veterinary science field, hence the highest probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could indicate a good fit for computer science, but the personality sketch does not mention a strong interest in technology or programming.
- Business administration is the least likely fit based on the personality sketch, as there is no mention of interests or skills related to business, management, or finance.
