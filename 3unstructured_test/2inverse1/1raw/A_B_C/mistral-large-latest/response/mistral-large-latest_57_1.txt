Explanation:
- Computer Science: Adam's puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest he could be a good fit for computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals reduces the probability somewhat.
- Business Administration: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could apply to business administration, the personality sketch lacks business-oriented traits, resulting in a lower probability.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work, there is a high probability that the sketch is about him if he were in this field.
