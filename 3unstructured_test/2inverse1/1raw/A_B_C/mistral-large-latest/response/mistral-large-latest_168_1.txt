Explanation:
- "Computer Science": Adam's problem-solving skills and ability to understand abstract concepts are relevant to computer science, hence a moderate probability of 0.4.
- "Business Administration": While Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be useful, his interests seem more aligned with nature and puzzles than business, hence a lower probability of 0.2.
- "Agricultural and Veterinary Science": This field aligns most closely with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy, making it the most likely field with a probability of 0.7.
