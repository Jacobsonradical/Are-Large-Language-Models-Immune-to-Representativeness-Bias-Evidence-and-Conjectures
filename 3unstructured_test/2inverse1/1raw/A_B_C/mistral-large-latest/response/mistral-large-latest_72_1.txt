Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the highest probability.
- The subject's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could also fit well in computer science, but the personality sketch doesn't provide specific indicators for this field, hence a moderate probability.
- The subject's traits do not seem to align as strongly with business administration, as there are no mentions of leadership, management, or entrepreneurial skills, hence the lowest probability.
