Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he could be successful in computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals reduces the probability somewhat.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.85): Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, there is a high probability that the sketch is about him if he was enrolled in this field.
- Business Administration (0.2): While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, his interests and personality traits as described do not strongly align with business administration. Hence, the lowest probability is assigned to this field.
