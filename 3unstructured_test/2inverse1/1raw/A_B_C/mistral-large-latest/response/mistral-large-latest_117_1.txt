Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with the problem-solving and logical thinking required in computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals suggests this might not be the best fit.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, this field seems to be a very good fit.
- Business Administration (0.3): While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there are no clear indicators in the personality sketch that suggest an interest in business-related topics. Therefore, this field seems less likely.
