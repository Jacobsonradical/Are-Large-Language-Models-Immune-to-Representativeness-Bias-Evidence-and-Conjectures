Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills needed for computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature isn't directly tied to this field.
- Business Administration (0.2): While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could be useful in business, his personality sketch doesn't highlight key traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, extraversion, or a focus on management and finance.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.85): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make him a strong fit for this field. His intelligence and appreciation for hard work also align well with the demands of agricultural and veterinary science.
