  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align most closely with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the highest probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest a good fit for computer science, but the personality sketch does not mention a strong interest in technology or programming.
- Business administration is the least likely fit based on the personality sketch, as there is no mention of interests or skills related to business, management, or finance. However, there is still a small probability due to the subject's understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
