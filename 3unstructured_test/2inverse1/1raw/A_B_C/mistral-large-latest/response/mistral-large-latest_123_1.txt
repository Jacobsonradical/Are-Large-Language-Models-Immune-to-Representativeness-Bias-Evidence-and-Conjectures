Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the highest probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could indicate a good fit for computer science, but the personality sketch does not emphasize technological interests.
- Business administration is less likely based on the given traits, as there are no clear indications of interest or aptitude for business-related activities.
