Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the highest probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could also fit well in computer science, but the personality sketch doesn't emphasize technological interests.
- Business administration is less likely, as the personality sketch does not mention interests in leadership, management, or business-related topics. However, understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to any field, hence a low but non-zero probability.
