Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with skills needed for computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals is less typical of computer science students.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): The sketch's focus on nature, plants, animals, and empathy strongly suggests a good fit with agricultural and veterinary sciences.
- Business Administration (0.3): While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could be useful in business, the sketch's focus on nature, animals, and quiet puzzles rather than interpersonal dynamics or leadership makes this field less likely.
