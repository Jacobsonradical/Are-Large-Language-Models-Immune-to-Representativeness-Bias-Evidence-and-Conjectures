Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align most strongly with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the highest probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills also align well with computer science.
- Business administration is less aligned with the subject's interests and skills, but still possible, hence the lowest but non-zero probability.
