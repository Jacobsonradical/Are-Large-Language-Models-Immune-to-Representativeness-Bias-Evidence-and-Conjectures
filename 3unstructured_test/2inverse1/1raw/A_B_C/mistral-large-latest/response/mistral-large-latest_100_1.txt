Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.2)**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could apply to business, the sketch emphasizes his love for nature, plants, and animals, which are not typically central to business administration.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field.
- **Computer Science (0.4)**: Adam's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could make him a good fit for computer science. However, the sketch's emphasis on nature and animals suggests a lower probability than agricultural and veterinary science.
