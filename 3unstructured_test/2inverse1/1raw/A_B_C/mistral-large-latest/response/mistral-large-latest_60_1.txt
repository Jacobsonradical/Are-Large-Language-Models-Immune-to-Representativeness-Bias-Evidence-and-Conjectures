- **Computer Science**: While the subject enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which could indicate an aptitude for computer science, the sketch doesn't provide direct evidence of interest in this field, hence the moderate probability.
- **Business Administration**: There's little in the sketch to suggest an interest in business administration, hence the low probability.
