Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The sketch mentions traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work, which are valuable in business, but the strong focus on nature, plants, and animals makes it less likely that Adam is in business administration.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, making it the most likely choice.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could fit well in computer science, but the strong focus on nature and animals suggests it might not be the best fit.
