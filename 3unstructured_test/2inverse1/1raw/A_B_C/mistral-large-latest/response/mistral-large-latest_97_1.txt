Explanation:
- "computer science": Adam's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns with skills needed in computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals suggests this might not be the best fit.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": This field aligns strongly with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. These factors make it the most likely field of study for him.
- "business administration": While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's little in the personality sketch to suggest a strong fit with business administration. Hence, the lowest probability is assigned to this field.
