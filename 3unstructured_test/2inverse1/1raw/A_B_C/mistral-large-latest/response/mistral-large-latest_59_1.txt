Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, hence the highest probability.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts suggest they could be well-suited to computer science, but the personality sketch doesn't provide as much evidence for this as it does for agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, there's little else in the personality sketch to suggest a strong fit with business administration.
