Explanation:
- "computer science": The subject's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with the skills needed for computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals reduces the probability somewhat.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make this field a strong fit, hence the high probability.
- "business administration": While the subject's intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to business administration, the personality sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in business or management topics, leading to a lower probability.
