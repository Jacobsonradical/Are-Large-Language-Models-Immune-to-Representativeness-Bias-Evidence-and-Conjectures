- The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles also suggest a potential fit with computer science, but to a lesser extent than agricultural and veterinary science, hence a probability of 0.4.
- Business administration seems the least likely fit based on the personality sketch, as it does not mention any interests or traits that are typically associated with this field, hence the lowest probability of 0.2.
