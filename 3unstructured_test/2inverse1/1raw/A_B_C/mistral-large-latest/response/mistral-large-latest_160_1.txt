Explanation:
- "Computer Science": Adam's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he could do well in computer science, but it's not a perfect match with his personality sketch, hence a probability of 0.6.
- "Agricultural and Veterinary Science": This field aligns strongly with Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, hence a high probability of 0.85.
- "Business Administration": While Adam's intelligence could help him in this field, there's little in the personality sketch to suggest a strong fit with business administration, hence a lower probability of 0.3.
