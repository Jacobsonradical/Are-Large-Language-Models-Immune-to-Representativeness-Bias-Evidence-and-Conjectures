Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, making it the most probable.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject is intelligent and appreciates hard work, there are no specific indicators pointing towards an interest in business, making it the least probable.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could indicate a fit for computer science, but it's less likely than agricultural and veterinary science due to the subject's strong connection to nature and animals.
