Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills needed for computer science. However, his strong love for animals and nature suggests this might not be his first choice.
- Business Administration (0.2): While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could be applicable, his personality sketch does not highlight typical business-related traits such as leadership, extraversion, or a focus on management or finance.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): This field aligns most closely with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with the demands of this field.
