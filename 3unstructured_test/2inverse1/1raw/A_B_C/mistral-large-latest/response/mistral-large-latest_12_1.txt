Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The subject's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not strongly align with typical interests in business administration, hence a lower probability.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy make this field a very likely fit, hence a higher probability.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles make this field a moderately likely fit, hence a moderate probability.
