Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a high likelihood of being in this field.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles make this a reasonable fit, but not as strongly indicated as agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Business Administration**: This field is the least likely based on the personality sketch, as there are no strong indicators pointing towards an interest or aptitude for business administration.
