Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the highest probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could indicate a good fit for computer science, but the personality sketch does not emphasize technological interests.
- Business administration seems the least likely fit based on the personality sketch, as it does not mention interests or skills related to business, management, or leadership.
