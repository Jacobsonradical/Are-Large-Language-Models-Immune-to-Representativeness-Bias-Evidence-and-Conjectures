```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could apply to business, his interests in nature, plants, and animals suggest a lower probability for this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns strongly with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, making it the most probable field.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts make this a reasonably probable field, but it's less likely than agricultural and veterinary science due to his strong connection to nature and animals.
