Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work could apply to business, his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest a lower probability for this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns strongly with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, making it the most probable field of study.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles make this a reasonable fit, but it's less strongly indicated than agricultural and veterinary science.
