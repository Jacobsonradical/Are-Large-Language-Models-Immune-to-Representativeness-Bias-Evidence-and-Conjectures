Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the agricultural and veterinary science field, hence the high probability.
- The subject's quiet nature, enjoyment of puzzles, and high intelligence could fit well in computer science, but the personality sketch doesn't emphasize technological interests, hence the moderate probability.
- Business administration seems the least likely fit given the subject's interests and personality traits, hence the low probability.
