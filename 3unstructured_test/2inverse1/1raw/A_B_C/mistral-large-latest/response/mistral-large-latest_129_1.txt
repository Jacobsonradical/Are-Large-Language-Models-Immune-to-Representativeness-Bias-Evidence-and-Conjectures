Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, hence the highest probability.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, there's little else in the sketch to suggest an interest in business, hence the lowest probability.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could indicate an aptitude for computer science, but it's not as strongly suggested as the agricultural and veterinary science field.
