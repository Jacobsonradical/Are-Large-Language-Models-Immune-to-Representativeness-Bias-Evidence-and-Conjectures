Explanation:
- The subject's interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as their strong empathy, aligns well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
- Their enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could indicate a good fit for computer science, but it's not as strongly suggested as the first field.
- Business administration seems the least likely fit given the personality traits described, as there's no clear indication of interest or aptitude for business-related topics.
