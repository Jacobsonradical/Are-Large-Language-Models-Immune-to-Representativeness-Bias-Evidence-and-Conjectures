Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, making it the most probable.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject is intelligent and appreciates hard work, there are no specific indicators pointing towards an interest in business, making this the least probable.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could fit well with computer science, but it's not as strongly indicated as the agricultural and veterinary science field.
