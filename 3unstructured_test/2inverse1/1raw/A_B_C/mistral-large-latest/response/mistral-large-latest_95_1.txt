Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high probability.
- The subject's quiet nature, enjoyment of puzzles, and high intelligence could fit well in computer science, but the personality sketch doesn't emphasize technological interests, hence the moderate probability.
- Business administration seems the least likely fit given the subject's interests and personality traits, but it's still possible, hence the low but non-zero probability.
