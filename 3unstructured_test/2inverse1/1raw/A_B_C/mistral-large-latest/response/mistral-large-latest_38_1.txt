Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit well with this field. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals reduces the probability slightly.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): This field aligns strongly with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
- Business Administration (0.3): While Adam's high intelligence could be applicable, the personality sketch does not highlight relevant traits for this field, such as leadership, extraversion, or a strong focus on management and organizational skills.
