Explanation:
- "Computer Science": Adam's affinity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with the skills needed in computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature slightly reduces the probability.
- "Agricultural and Veterinary Science": This field aligns very well with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, making the probability higher.
- "Business Administration": While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's less indication in the personality sketch that he has a strong interest in business-related topics, hence the lower probability.
