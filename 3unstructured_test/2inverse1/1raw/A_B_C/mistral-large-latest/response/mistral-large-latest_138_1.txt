Explanation:
- "computer science": Adam's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with the skills needed for computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature does not directly correlate with this field, hence a probability of 0.6.
- "business administration": While Adam's high intelligence could be applicable, his personality traits such as quietness, empathy, and love for nature and animals do not strongly correlate with the typical traits of business administration students, hence a lower probability of 0.2.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": This field aligns very well with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with the demands of this field, hence a high probability of 0.85.
