Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field, hence the highest probability.
- **Computer Science**: While the subject enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which could indicate an aptitude for computer science, the personality sketch does not strongly emphasize technological interests, hence a moderate probability.
- **Business Administration**: This field seems the least likely given the subject's interests and personality traits, as there is no mention of leadership, management, or business acumen, hence the lowest probability.
