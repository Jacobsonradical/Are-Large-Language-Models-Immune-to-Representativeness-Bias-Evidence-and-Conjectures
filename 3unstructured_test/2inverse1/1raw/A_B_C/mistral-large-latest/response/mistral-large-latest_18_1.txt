Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field, hence the highest probability.
- **Business Administration**: This field seems least likely given the subject's preferences for nature, animals, and puzzles over business-related topics.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's affinity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts makes this field a reasonable fit, but not as strong as agricultural and veterinary science.
