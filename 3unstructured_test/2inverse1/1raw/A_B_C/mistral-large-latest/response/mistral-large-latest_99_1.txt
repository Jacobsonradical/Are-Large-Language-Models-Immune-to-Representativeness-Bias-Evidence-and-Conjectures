Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the highest probability.
- The subject's intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could fit well in computer science, but the personality sketch doesn't emphasize technological interests.
- Business administration is less likely, as the subject's interests and qualities described do not directly relate to this field. However, understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to any field, hence a low but non-zero probability.
