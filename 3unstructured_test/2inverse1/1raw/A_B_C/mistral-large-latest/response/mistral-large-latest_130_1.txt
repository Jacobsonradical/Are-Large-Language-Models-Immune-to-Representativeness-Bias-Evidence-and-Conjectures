Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high probability.
- The subject's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could make them a good fit for computer science, but the personality sketch does not provide direct evidence of an interest in computers or programming.
- The subject's appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to any field, but there is little in the personality sketch to suggest a specific interest in business administration.
