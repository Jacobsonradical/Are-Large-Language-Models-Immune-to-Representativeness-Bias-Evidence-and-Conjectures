Explanation:
- The subject's interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as their strong empathy, aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the highest probability.
- Their aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests they could also succeed in computer science, but the personality sketch as a whole is less typical of this field.
- The subject's qualities and interests are least aligned with business administration, resulting in the lowest probability.
