Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high probability.
- The subject's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles could indicate a good fit for computer science, but it's not as strong a match as agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business administration seems the least likely fit given the subject's personality and interests, but there is still a small probability as the subject appreciates hard work and dedication, which are valuable traits in any field.
