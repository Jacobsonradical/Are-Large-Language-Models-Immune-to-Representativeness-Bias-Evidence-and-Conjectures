Explanation:
- "Computer Science": Adam's strong intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills needed for computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals suggests this might not be the best fit.
- "Agricultural and Veterinary Science": This field aligns very well with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. These factors make it the most likely field of study for him.
- "Business Administration": While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there are no strong indicators in the personality sketch that suggest he would be particularly drawn to business administration over other fields.
