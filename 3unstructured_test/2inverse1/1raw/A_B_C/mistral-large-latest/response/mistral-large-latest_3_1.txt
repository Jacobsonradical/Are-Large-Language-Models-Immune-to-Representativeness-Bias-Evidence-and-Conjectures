Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with skills needed for computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals suggests it might not be the most fitting field.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8): This field aligns strongly with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, making it the most likely field of study.
- Business Administration (0.3): While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's little in the personality sketch to suggest an interest in business-related topics.
