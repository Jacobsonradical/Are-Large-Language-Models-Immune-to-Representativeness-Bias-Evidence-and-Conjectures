Explanation:
- The subject's interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as their strong empathy, aligns most closely with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the highest probability.
- The subject's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts could indicate a good fit for computer science, but the personality sketch does not emphasize technological interests.
- Business administration is the least likely fit based on the personality sketch, as there are no clear indicators of interest or aptitude for business-related topics.
