Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, hence the high probability.
- The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts could indicate a good fit for computer science, but it's not as strong a match as agricultural and veterinary science.
