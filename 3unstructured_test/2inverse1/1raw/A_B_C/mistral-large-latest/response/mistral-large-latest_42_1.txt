  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science, hence the highest probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could also fit well in computer science, but the personality sketch as a whole is less typical of computer science students, hence a moderate probability.
- The subject's personality sketch has the least alignment with business administration, as it does not mention characteristics typically associated with this field, such as leadership, management skills, or interest in business, hence the lowest probability.
