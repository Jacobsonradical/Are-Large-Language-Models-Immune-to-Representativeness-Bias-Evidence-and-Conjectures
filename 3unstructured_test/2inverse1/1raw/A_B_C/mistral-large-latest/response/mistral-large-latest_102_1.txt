Explanation:
- Computer Science (0.6): Adam's aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns with the skills needed for computer science. However, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, plants, and animals suggests a stronger fit elsewhere.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.85): This field aligns very well with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy. These qualities suggest a high probability that the sketch is about Adam if he were in this field.
- Business Administration (0.3): While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there are no specific indicators in the sketch that suggest a strong fit for business administration. Hence, the lowest probability is assigned to this field.
