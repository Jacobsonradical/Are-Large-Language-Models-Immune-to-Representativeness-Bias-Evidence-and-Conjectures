Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences, hence the highest probability.
- The subject's intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills could indicate a good fit for computer science, but the personality sketch doesn't emphasize technological interests.
- Business administration seems the least likely fit, as the subject's interests and qualities described do not directly correlate with this field.
