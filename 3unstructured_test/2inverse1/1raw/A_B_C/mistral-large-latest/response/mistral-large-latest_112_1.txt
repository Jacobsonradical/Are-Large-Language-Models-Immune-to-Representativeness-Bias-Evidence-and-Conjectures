Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with this field, hence the highest probability.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts could fit well in computer science, but it's not as strongly indicated as the first field.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject appreciates hard work and dedication, there's little else in the personality sketch that suggests an interest in business administration, hence the lowest probability.
