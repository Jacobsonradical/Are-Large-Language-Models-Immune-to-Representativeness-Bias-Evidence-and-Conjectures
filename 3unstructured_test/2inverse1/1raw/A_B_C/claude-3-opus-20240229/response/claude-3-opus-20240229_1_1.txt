Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a high probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Their high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science, but the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant, so I assigned a moderate probability.

The personality sketch does not mention many traits that seem directly related to business administration, so I assigned a relatively low probability for that field. The subject's intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business, but the other interests point more towards other fields.
