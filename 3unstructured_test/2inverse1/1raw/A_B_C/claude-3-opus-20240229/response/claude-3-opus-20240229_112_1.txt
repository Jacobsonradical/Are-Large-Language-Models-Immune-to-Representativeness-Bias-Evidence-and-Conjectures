Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a high probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles also fit somewhat with computer science, but not as strongly as with agricultural and veterinary science.

Business administration seems the least likely fit based on the personality description provided, as traits like curiosity about nature and love for animals are not as directly relevant. However, intelligence, dedication and understanding abstract concepts could still be applicable.
