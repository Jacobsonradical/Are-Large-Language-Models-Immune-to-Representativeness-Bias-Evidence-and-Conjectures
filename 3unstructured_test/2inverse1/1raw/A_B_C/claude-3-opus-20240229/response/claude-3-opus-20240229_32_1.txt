Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy, which suggests a high probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree. Business administration seems less likely given the emphasis on nature, animals and empathy over typical business-related traits.
