Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract thinking. While these traits could potentially apply to any field, they seem most closely aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. The curiosity about plants, love for animals, and dedication are all qualities that would fit well with this field of study.

Computer science also involves abstract thinking and problem-solving, so there is a reasonable probability the sketch could describe a computer science student. However, the other traits mentioned are less directly relevant.

Business administration seems the least likely fit, as the sketch doesn't mention anything about leadership, entrepreneurship, finance, or other common business-related interests. However, the intelligence, dedication and problem-solving abilities mentioned could still apply to a business student, so I gave it a non-zero probability.
