Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in nature, plants, animals and a deep empathy, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of intelligence, abstract thinking and puzzle-solving skills also suggests some fit with computer science. Business administration seems least likely given the emphasis on nature, animals and empathy over typical business-related traits. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information about the individual.
