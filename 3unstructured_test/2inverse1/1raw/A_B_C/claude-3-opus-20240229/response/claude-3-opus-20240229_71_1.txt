Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who loves nature, plants and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science. While business administration is possible, there is less in the personality sketch to specifically suggest that field compared to the other two. Of course, this is just my best estimate based on limited information.
