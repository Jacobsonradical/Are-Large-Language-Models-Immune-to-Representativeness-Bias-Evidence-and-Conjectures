Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest and empathy for nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science, though the sketch doesn't specifically mention an interest in technology. Business administration seems less likely given the subject's quiet nature and interests, though it can't be ruled out completely.
