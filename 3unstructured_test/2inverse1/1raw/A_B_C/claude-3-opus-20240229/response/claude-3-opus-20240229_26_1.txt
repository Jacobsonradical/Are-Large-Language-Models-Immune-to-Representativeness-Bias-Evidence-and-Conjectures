Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as a deep love for animals. This suggests a strong fit and high probability for agricultural and veterinary science.

The subject also enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which could fit well with computer science. However, the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to computer science, so I estimate a lower probability than for agricultural and veterinary science.

Finally, while high intelligence and an appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business administration, the other traits and interests mentioned seem less directly applicable. Therefore, I estimate the lowest probability for business administration out of the three fields.
