Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, which strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science. Problem-solving skills and understanding abstract concepts could be relevant to computer science. Business administration seems less likely given the personality profile, but the mention of understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication could have some relevance. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
