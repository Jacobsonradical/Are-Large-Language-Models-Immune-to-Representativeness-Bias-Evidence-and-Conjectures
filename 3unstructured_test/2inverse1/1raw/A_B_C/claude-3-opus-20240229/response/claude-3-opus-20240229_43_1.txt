Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits of having a curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and empathy suggest a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science.

Being good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles could fit with studying computer science, but the other traits seem less directly relevant, so I assigned a moderate probability.

The traits mentioned don't seem to strongly indicate an inclination towards business administration compared to the other two fields, so I gave that the lowest probability. Understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication is somewhat relevant but not highly specific to business.
