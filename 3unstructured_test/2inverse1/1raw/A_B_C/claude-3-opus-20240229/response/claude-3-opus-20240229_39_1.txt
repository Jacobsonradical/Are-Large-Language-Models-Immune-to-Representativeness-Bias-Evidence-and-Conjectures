Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, animals, and hard work. This suggests a higher probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, but is less directly related than the other traits. Business administration seems least likely given the emphasis on nature, animals and abstract thinking over typical business skills and interests. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information about the individual.
