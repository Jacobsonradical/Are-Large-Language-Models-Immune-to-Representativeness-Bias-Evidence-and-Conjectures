Here is my estimate for the probabilities that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on his enrollment in different graduate fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants and animals, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of intelligence, abstract thinking and puzzle-solving also fits decently well with computer science. Business administration seems less likely given the personality traits highlighted, but it's still possible. The probabilities are estimates based on limited information.
