Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, as well as empathy, which strongly aligns with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, but the overall description seems to lean more towards an interest in the natural world. Business administration seems less likely given the sketch, as it doesn't mention anything about leadership, entrepreneurship, finance, or other common business-related traits or interests. Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information.
