Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.5"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a high likelihood of studying agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science. While business administration is certainly possible, the personality sketch provides fewer clear indicators pointing in that direction compared to the other two fields.
