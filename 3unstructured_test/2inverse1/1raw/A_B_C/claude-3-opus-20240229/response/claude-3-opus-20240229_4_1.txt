Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy, which seem to align well with agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science. While business administration requires dedication and hard work, the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to that field compared to the other two, in my estimation.
