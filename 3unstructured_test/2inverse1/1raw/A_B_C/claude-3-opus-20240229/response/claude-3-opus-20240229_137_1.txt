Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and dedication. This seems to align most closely with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science or certain business fields as well, but the overall description seems to point most strongly to a student of veterinary medicine, animal science, or a related agricultural field.
