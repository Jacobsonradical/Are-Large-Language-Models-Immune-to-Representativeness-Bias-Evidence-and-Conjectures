Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest and empathy for animals and plants, which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. Problem-solving skills and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science. The traits seem less directly relevant to business administration, though dedication and hard work are generally applicable. Of course, these are rough estimates based on limited information.
