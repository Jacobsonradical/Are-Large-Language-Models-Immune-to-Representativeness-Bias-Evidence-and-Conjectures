Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a higher probability of being in the agricultural and veterinary science field.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, but are not as strongly indicative as the traits pointing towards agricultural and veterinary science.

While business administration requires intelligence and hard work, the other mentioned traits don't seem to align as closely with typical traits associated with that field. So I assigned it the lowest probability of the three.
