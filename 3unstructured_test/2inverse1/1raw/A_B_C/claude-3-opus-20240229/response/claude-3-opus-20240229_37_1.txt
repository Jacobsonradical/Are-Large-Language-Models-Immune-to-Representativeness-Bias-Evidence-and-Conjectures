Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a high probability of around 0.8 that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts give a moderate probability of around 0.4 that he was studying computer science. 

Business administration seems less likely, with a probability of around 0.2, as the personality sketch does not highlight traits commonly associated with that field like leadership, interpersonal skills, or interest in finance and management. The focus on nature, animals and abstract thinking are less directly relevant.
