Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. Their intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, but the other traits mentioned are less directly relevant. While dedication and hard work are important in business administration, the personality sketch overall seems less tailored to that field compared to the others.
