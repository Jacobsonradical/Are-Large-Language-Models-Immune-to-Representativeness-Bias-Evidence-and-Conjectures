Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest a higher probability that Adam is studying agricultural and veterinary science. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit well with computer science. While business administration graduate students certainly can have those traits too, the overall profile seems to align less strongly with typical business students compared to the other two fields.
