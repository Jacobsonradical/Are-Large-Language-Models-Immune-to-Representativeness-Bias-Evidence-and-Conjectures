Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his graduate field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and dedication. This aligns most closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, though the other traits are less directly relevant. 

While business administration requires dedication and hard work, the other interests and personality traits seem less well-aligned with that field compared to the other two options.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information. The individual's true academic interests could diverge from their personality profile. But based solely on the sketch provided, I'd assess agricultural and veterinary science as the most probable field, followed by computer science and then business administration.
