Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking. This aligns most strongly with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The curiosity, intelligence and abstract thinking ability could also fit well with computer science. The traits seem less directly applicable to business administration, though the work ethic and intelligence could be relevant there as well.
