Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a higher probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science. The traits of enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts also fit with computer science to some degree. Business administration seems less likely given the emphasis on nature, animals and abstract thinking over typical business-oriented traits. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
