Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication seem most aligned with graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts have some overlap with computer science. Business administration seems less probable given the details provided. Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information about Adam's personality.
