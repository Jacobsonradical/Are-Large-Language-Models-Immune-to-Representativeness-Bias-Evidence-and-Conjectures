Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Explanation:
- Computer science: The subject's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest a reasonable probability of studying computer science. However, the sketch does not specifically mention an interest in technology or programming.

- Agricultural and veterinary science: The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals strongly indicate a high probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of empathy and a warm heart also aligns well with a career in animal care.

- Business administration: While the subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business administration, the other traits mentioned in the sketch do not strongly suggest this field of study. The probability is estimated to be lower compared to the other two options.
