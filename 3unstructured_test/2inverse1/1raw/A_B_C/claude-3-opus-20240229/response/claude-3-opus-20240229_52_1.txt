Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem most aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. Problem solving skills and understanding abstract concepts could fit well with computer science. Business administration seems least likely given the personality description, but the intelligence and dedication traits have some relevance. These are rough estimates based on limited information.
