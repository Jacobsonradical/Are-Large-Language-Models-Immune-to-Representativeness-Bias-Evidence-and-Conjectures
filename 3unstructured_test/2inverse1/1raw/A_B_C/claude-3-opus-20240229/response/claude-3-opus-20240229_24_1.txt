Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and abstract thinking. While computer science involves abstract concepts, the other traits seem less relevant. Business administration also seems less aligned with the personality profile. Agricultural and veterinary science appears to be the best match, given the mentions of curiosity about plants, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication which are important in that field.
