Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love of nature, animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which strongly suggests a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science. The curiosity, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science. Business administration seems like the least likely fit based on the personality description, but the intelligence and dedication could still apply to some degree.
