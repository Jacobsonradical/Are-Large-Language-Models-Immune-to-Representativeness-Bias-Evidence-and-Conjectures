Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and a curiosity about plants, which strongly suggests agricultural and veterinary science. The traits of high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts also fit well with computer science. Business administration seems less likely given the personality description, but the empathy, dedication and hard work could apply to business careers to some degree.
