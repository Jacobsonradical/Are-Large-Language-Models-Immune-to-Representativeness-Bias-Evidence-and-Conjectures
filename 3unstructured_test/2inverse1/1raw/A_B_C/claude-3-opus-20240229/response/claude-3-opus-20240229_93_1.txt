Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals, which aligns most closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Problem-solving skills and abstract thinking abilities could fit well with computer science. The traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to business administration, though understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication are certainly valuable in any field.
