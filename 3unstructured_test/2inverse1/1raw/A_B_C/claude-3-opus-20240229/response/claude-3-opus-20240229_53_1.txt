Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a high probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science. 

His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, but the other traits mentioned are less directly relevant, so I assigned a medium probability to that field.

The personality sketch does not strongly indicate traits commonly associated with business administration, so I estimated a relatively low probability for that field of study.
