Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch mentions a love of nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy, which seems to align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. The puzzle-solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree. Business administration seems less likely given the overall description, but the dedication and hard work could apply there. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
