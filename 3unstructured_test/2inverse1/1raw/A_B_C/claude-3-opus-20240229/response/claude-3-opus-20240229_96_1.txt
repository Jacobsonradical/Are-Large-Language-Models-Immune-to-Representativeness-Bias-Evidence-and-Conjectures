Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals which aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science too. Business administration seems less likely given the emphasis on empathy, love of animals and nature. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
