Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, the subject has a strong interest in and empathy for animals and plants, which suggests a high probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science. 

The subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, giving that a fairly high probability as well.

While business administration is certainly possible, the personality sketch doesn't provide as many clues pointing in that direction compared to the other two fields, so I assigned it a lower probability. Problem solving skills could be applicable to business though.

These are rough estimates based on the limited information provided. The actual probabilities would depend on many other factors not covered in the brief personality sketch.
