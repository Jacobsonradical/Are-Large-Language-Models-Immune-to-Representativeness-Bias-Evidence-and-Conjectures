Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication suggest a high probability of around 0.8 that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of being good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, along with high intelligence, give a moderate probability of around 0.4 that he was studying computer science. 

The empathy, warm heart and other traits don't seem to strongly indicate business administration, so I estimate a lower probability of around 0.2 for that field based on the personality description provided.
