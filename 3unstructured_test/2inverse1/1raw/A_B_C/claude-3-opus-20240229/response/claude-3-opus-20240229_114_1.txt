Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on his field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, animals, and a warm and empathetic personality. This aligns most strongly with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of intelligence, abstract thinking and puzzle-solving skills suggests some overlap with a field like computer science. The traits mentioned seem to have the least overlap with typical traits associated with business administration. Of course, any individual can have a diverse set of interests and strengths. This is just my best estimate based on the limited information provided.
