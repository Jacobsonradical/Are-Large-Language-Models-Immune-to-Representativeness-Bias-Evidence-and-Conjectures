Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who loves nature, plants, and animals, has strong empathy, and appreciates hard work and dedication. This aligns most closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

The subject's intelligence, abstract thinking ability, and enjoyment of puzzles could fit well with computer science too, so I assigned that a moderate probability. 

Business administration seems least likely given the personality description, so I gave that the lowest probability, but it's still a possibility.
