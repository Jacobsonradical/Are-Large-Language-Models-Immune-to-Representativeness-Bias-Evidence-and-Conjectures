Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest Adam is more likely to be studying agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science as well. Business administration seems less likely given his specific interests, but still possible. These are rough estimates based on limited information.
