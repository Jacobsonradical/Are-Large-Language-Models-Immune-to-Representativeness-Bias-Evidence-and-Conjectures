Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, animals and a caring empathetic personality, which aligns most strongly with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of intelligence, abstract thinking and puzzle-solving could fit well with computer science, though the other traits seem less relevant, so I assigned a moderate probability there.

Business administration seems the least likely fit given the personality description, as it doesn't mention anything about leadership, entrepreneurship, economics, management or other common business-related traits or interests. So I gave that the lowest probability.
