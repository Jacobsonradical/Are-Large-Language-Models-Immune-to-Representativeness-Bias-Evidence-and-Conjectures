Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication seem to align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree.

Business administration seems less probable given the personality description, but the appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to some extent.
