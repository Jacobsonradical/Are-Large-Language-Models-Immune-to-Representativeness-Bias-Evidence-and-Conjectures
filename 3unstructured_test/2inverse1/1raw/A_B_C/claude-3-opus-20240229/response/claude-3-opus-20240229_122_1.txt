Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving skills, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts suggest a reasonable probability of studying computer science. 

However, the strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy align even more closely with agricultural and veterinary science.

While dedication and hard work are valuable in business administration, the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant, so I assigned a lower probability to that field of study.
