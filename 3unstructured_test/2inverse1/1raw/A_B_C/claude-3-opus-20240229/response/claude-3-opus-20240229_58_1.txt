Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest a high probability of around 0.8 that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are also consistent with studying computer science, so I estimate a probability of around 0.6 for that field.

Business administration seems less likely given the personality description, so I assign a lower probability of 0.3 for that field of study. The personality sketch does not emphasize traits like leadership, competitiveness or financial interests that might be more associated with business.
