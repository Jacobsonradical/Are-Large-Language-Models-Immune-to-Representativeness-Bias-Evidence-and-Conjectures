Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, for each of the given fields of graduate study:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy, which seems to align well with agricultural and veterinary science. The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit with computer science to some degree. Business administration seems less likely given the other traits and interests described, but the dedication and hard work mentioned could apply there to an extent. These are rough estimates based on the limited information provided.
