Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.5"
}

The subject's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, as well as his appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a high probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, but the other traits mentioned are less directly relevant, so I assign a medium probability.

The personality sketch does not strongly indicate traits commonly associated with business administration, so I assign a lower probability for that field, although his intelligence and appreciation for hard work could still be applicable.
