Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest a higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are also consistent with computer science, though to a somewhat lesser degree.

While business administration requires intelligence and hard work, the other traits seem less directly relevant, so I assigned a lower probability to that field.
