Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract thinking. While these qualities could be found in students across many fields, they seem particularly well-suited to agricultural and veterinary science. The curiosity about plants, love for animals, and dedication are all highly relevant to this field.

Computer science also involves abstract thinking and problem-solving, so there is a reasonable chance the sketch could describe a computer science student. However, the other traits are less directly relevant.

Business administration seems the least likely fit, as the sketch does not mention any business-related interests or skills. However, the intelligence, dedication and problem-solving abilities could be applicable in business settings, so I did not assign a very low probability.
