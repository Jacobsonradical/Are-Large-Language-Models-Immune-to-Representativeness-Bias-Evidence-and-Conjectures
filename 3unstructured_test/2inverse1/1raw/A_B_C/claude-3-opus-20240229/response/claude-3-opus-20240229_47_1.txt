Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes the subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. This fits very well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. 

The subject's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts and enjoyment of solving puzzles could align with computer science to some degree, though the other traits mentioned are less relevant for that field.

Business administration seems the least likely fit, as the personality sketch doesn't highlight any strong interest in business, management, finance, leadership or other common traits for that field. The general intelligence and work ethic could apply to any field.

So in summary, I believe agricultural and veterinary science is the most probable field of study for Adam based on the given personality sketch, with a lower but still reasonable probability for computer science, and a relatively low probability for business administration. The probabilities are estimates and not meant to definitively add to 1.
