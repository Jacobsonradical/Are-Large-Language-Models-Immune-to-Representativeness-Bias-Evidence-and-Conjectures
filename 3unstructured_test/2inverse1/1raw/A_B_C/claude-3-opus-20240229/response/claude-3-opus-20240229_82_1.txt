Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggests a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. Their high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science. While business administration is a possibility, the personality sketch provides fewer direct indicators of aptitude or interest in that field compared to the other two.
