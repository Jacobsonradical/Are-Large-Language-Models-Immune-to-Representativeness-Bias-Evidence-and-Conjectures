Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as empathy and a love for animals. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

The sketch also mentions an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, which could fit with computer science. However, the overall emphasis on nature and animals makes me think agricultural and veterinary science is more likely.

While the mention of understanding hard work and dedication could apply to business administration, overall the personality profile doesn't seem to align as strongly with typical traits and interests of someone in that field compared to the other two options.
