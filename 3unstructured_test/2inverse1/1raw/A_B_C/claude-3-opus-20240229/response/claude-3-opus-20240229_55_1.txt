Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication suggest a high probability of studying agricultural and veterinary science.

The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts point to a reasonably high likelihood of studying computer science as well.

Business administration seems less likely given the emphasis on nature, animals and abstract thinking over typical business-oriented traits. However, the appreciation for hard work and dedication still makes it a possibility.
