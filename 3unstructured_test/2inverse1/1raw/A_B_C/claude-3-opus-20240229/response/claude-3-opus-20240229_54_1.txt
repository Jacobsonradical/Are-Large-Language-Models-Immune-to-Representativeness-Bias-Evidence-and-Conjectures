Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, combined with a deep love for animals, suggests a strong likelihood of studying agricultural and veterinary science.

While the subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with computer science, the personality sketch does not specifically mention an interest in technology or computers.

The mention of understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could relate to business administration, but the overall personality sketch seems less directly aligned with typical business student traits compared to agricultural/veterinary fields.
