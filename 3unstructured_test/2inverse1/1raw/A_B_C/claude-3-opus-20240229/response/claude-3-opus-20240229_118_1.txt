Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Based on the personality traits described, such as a deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and high intelligence, I believe Adam is most likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Computer science is also a possibility given his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, but the other traits seem less relevant. Business administration seems least likely given the emphasis on nature, animals, and abstract thinking over typical business skills and interests.
