Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

Explanation:
The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest a higher probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science. 
The subject's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit well with computer science.
While the subject's understanding of hard work and dedication could be applicable to business administration, the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant to that field compared to the other two.
