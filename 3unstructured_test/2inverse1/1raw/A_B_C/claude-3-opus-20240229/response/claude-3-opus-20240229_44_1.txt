Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. The mention of high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could fit with computer science. Business administration seems less likely given the overall profile, but the dedication and hard work aspect could apply there. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
