Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes a love of nature, animals, and a warm, empathetic personality. This seems most consistent with a student of agricultural and veterinary science. The traits of intelligence and abstract thinking ability could fit well with computer science. While business administration students can certainly have the traits described, they seem less likely to be defining characteristics compared to the other two fields. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on general stereotypes about these fields of study.
