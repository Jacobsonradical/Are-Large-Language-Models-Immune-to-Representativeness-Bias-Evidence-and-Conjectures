Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence. These traits are strongly associated with computer science. While a love for nature isn't a direct indicator, many computer scientists appreciate the natural world.
* **Business Administration:** The sketch's emphasis on empathy, a warm heart, and appreciation for hard work could apply to business administration. However, the core intellectual traits mentioned are less specifically aligned with this field compared to computer science. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective assessment based on limited information and stereotypes. There are many individuals in both fields who might fit the description, and many other factors influence career choice.
