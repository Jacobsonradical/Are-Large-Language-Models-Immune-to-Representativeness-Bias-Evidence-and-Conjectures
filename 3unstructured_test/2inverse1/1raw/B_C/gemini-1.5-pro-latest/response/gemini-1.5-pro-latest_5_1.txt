Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is far from definitive:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," "good at understanding abstract concepts" align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and a quiet demeanor. These aren't as stereotypical in business students, though certainly not impossible.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid over-interpreting personality sketches.  Many people in business fields are deeply empathetic and nature-loving.  Similarly, many computer scientists are outgoing and socially adept. This exercise is about probabilities based on limited information, not definitive judgments.
