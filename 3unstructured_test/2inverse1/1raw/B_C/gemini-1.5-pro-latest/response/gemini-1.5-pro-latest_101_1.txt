Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ all traits often associated with computer science students. While a love for nature isn't exclusive to CS, it's not uncommon for people drawn to technical fields to also find beauty in natural systems.

* **Business Administration:** The profile doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, they aren't specific indicators. The lack of mention of leadership, ambition, or financial interest makes a business administration focus less likely. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid over-generalizing.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and nature-loving, and many computer scientists might not fit this personality sketch at all. This exercise is about probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes.
