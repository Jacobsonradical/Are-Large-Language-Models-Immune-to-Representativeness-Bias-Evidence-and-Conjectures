Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind that this is based on a very limited personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence. These traits are strongly associated with computer science, making it a more likely field for Adam.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of an interest in business concepts, leadership, or finance.  The love of nature and animals could suggest alternative career paths.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. Many individuals with these traits excel in various fields, and there's a lot of diversity within both business and computer science.
