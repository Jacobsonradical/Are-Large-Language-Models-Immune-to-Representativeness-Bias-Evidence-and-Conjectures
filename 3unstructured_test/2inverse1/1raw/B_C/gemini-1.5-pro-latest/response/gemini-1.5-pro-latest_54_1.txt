Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The emphasis on puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence strongly aligns with the field of computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** While someone in business administration could be intelligent and have empathy, the description lacks a focus on more typical business-oriented traits like leadership,  negotiation, or financial acumen. The love for nature and animals might suggest a less common personality type for this field.

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches can be misleading. These probabilities are based on stereotypes and the provided information.  Many individuals in business administration might fit the description, and many computer science students might not.
