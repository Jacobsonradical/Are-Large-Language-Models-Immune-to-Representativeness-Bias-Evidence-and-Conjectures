Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, understanding abstract concepts, high intelligence) align strongly with skills and aptitudes often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the description's emphasis on nature, animals, and potentially less social hobbies ("quiet boy") makes it seem less likely compared to computer science.

**Important Notes:**

* These are just estimates based on general stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field vary greatly.
*  Without more information about Adam's specific interests and goals, it's impossible to be definitive.
