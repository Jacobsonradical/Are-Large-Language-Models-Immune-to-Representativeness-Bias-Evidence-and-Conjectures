Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, understanding abstract concepts, high intelligence) align well with skills often found in computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and a love for animals. These traits are not as strongly associated with typical business administration stereotypes.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong generalizations.  Many individuals in business administration may share the described traits, and many computer science students may not. This assessment is based on probabilistic reasoning given the limited information.
