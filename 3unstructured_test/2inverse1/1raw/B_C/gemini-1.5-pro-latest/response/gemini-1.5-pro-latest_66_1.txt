Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned align well with a computer science student.  "Enjoying solving puzzles," "high intelligence," and "understanding abstract concepts" are particularly relevant. 
* **Business Administration:** While someone in business administration can certainly be intelligent and empathetic, the description leans more heavily toward interests and skills often found in STEM fields like computer science.  

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on stereotypes.  There are many empathetic, nature-loving individuals in business, and many puzzle-solving computer scientists might not be interested in plants. This sketch doesn't provide enough information for a definitive judgment.
