Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and a short personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature, empathy, and a quiet demeanor aligns less strongly with the stereotypical image of a business administration student.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic pursuits. There are many nature-loving, empathetic individuals in business and many puzzle-solving, abstract thinkers in computer science.
