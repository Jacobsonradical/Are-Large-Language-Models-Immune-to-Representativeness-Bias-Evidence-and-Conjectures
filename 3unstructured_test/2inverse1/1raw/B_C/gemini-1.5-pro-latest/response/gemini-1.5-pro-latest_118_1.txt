Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) align strongly with the skills and interests often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While someone in business administration could possess these traits, the sketch emphasizes a connection to nature, empathy, and an appreciation for hard work which are not as stereotypical (though certainly not absent) in a business-focused personality.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches offer limited information, and people within any field can have diverse interests and skills. These probabilities simply reflect a likelihood based on common stereotypes associated with these fields.
