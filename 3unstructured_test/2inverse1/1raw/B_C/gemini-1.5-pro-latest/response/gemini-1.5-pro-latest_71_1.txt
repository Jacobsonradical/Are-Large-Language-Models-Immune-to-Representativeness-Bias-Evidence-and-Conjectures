Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description heavily emphasizes analytical skills ("solving puzzles", "understanding abstract concepts"), a trait often associated with computer science students.  His love for nature doesn't preclude this, and many computer scientists have diverse interests. 
* **Business Administration:** While "hard work and dedication" could apply to business students, the description lacks the strong indicators of ambition, leadership, or financial interest often associated with this field.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong stereotyping. Many individuals in business administration have a love for nature, and many computer scientists are deeply empathetic. This assessment is based on probability given limited information, not a definitive judgment.
