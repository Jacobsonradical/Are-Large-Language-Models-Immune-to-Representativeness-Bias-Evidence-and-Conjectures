Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based purely on a personality sketch and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence are strongly associated with computer science. The love for nature and empathy might be less common but not unheard of in the field. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality description leans more towards an analytical and possibly introverted individual. These traits are not exclusive to either field but might be slightly less common in stereotypical business administration settings.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that personality sketches are not reliable indicators of career choices. Many people with these traits excel in various fields, and these probabilities are rough estimates at best.
