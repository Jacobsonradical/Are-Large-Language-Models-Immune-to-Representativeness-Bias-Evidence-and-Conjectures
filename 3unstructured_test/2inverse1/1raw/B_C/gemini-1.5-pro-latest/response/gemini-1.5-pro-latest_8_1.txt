Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very broad stereotypes and individual variation is huge:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science. The love of nature and empathy, while not exclusive to computer science, don't contradict it either.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with business pursuits, such as ambition, leadership, or a focus on financial success. 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are far too general to accurately predict someone's field of study. 
* Many people in business administration could have the traits described, and many computer scientists might not fit this description.
* This is for illustrative purposes and should not be taken as a definitive assessment.
