Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) are strongly associated with computer science.  While people in many fields share these traits, they are core to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** The description doesn't strongly hint at traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, strong communication, or a focus on finance/marketing. However, intelligence, empathy, and understanding hard work are valuable in business too, just less specific to the field.

**Important Notes:**

* This assessment relies on general perceptions and stereotypes. There are many individuals in both fields who defy these stereotypes.
* The provided personality sketch is quite general. More specific details about Adam's interests, hobbies, and goals would allow for a more accurate assessment.
