Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical skills ("solving puzzles"), abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. The love for nature and animals might be less common but isn't contradictory. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with business students, such as leadership, ambition, or a strong interest in economics/finance. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on stereotypes and generalizations. Many individuals in business administration possess the traits described, and many computer science students might not.  Personality sketches provide limited information, and actual probabilities could vary significantly.
