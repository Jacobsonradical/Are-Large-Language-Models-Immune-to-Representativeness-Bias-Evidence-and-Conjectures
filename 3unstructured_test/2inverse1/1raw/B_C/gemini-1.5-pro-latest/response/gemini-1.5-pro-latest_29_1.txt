Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) strongly align with skills and interests common in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence, hard work, and empathy are valuable in business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business aspirations (e.g., leadership, risk-taking, strong communication). 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are subjective estimations based on general stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field can vary greatly. 
* The provided sketch offers no information about Adam's specific career goals or interests beyond his personality.
* A more accurate assessment would require additional information about Adam's background, experiences, and aspirations.
