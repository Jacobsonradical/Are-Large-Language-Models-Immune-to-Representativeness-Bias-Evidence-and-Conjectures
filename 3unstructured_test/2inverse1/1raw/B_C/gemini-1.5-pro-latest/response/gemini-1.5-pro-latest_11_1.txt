Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "understanding abstract concepts" are strongly associated with individuals pursuing computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** While someone in business administration can certainly possess these traits, the sketch emphasizes a connection to nature, empathy, and love for animals. These aren't as directly relevant to the core of business administration compared to computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches can offer hints, but they are not reliable predictors of a person's field of study. Many individuals with these traits could be found in both fields, and many other factors influence career choices.
