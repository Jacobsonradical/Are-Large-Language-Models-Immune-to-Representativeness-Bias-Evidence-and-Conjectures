Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence – traits often associated with computer science students.  The love of nature and animals, while not exclusive to CS, doesn't contradict the stereotype.
* **Business Administration:**  While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks a strong emphasis on leadership, competitiveness, or financial drive – traits often associated with business administration students.  

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid over-generalizing.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic, and many computer scientists are passionate about nature. This exercise simply uses broad stereotypes to estimate probabilities based on limited information.
