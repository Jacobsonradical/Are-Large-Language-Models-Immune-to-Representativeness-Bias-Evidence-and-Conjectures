Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "good at understanding abstract concepts" align strongly with the profile of someone drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While someone in business administration might have some of the mentioned traits (hard work, dedication), the description leans more towards a personality interested in scientific or analytical pursuits. 

**Important Note:** This is just a probabilistic assessment based on a brief personality sketch. There isn't enough information to definitively say which field Adam was *more likely* to be in.  Many individuals in business administration have a love for nature and animals, and many computer scientists might not!
