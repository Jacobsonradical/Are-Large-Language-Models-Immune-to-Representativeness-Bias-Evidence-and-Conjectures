Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," "understanding abstract concepts," and a potential interest in nature (bioinformatics is a growing field) align well with the profile of someone interested in computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While "hard work and dedication" are valued in business, the other traits don't strongly suggest a business inclination.  The sketch lacks typical indicators for business interest, such as leadership, risk-taking, or a focus on financial success.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative and based on stereotypical associations with these fields.  Many individuals in business administration may possess the described traits, and many computer science students might not.  A personality sketch is not a reliable predictor of someone's field of study.
