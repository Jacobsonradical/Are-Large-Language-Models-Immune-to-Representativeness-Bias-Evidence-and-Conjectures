Here's my assessment of the probabilities, based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles"), understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ all traits commonly associated with computer science students. The love for nature and empathy, while positive, are less directly relevant. 

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch lacks clear indicators of typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing. The emphasis on nature and empathy might suggest a less typical business student. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective assessment based on limited information and stereotypes.  Many individuals in business administration possess the described traits, and many computer science students might not. It's crucial to avoid overgeneralizing based on these probabilities.
