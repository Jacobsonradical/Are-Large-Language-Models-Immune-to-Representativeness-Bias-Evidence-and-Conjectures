Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch heavily emphasizes analytical skills ("solving puzzles," "high intelligence," "understanding abstract concepts"). These are strong indicators of someone potentially drawn to computer science. The love for nature and empathy could manifest in interests like AI ethics or environmental applications of technology.

* **Business Administration:** While someone in business administration can certainly be intelligent and empathetic, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with the field, such as a focus on leadership, management, or financial strategy. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Personality sketches can offer hints, but many individuals with these traits could excel in either field or choose entirely different paths.
