Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and a very limited personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. The love for nature might be less common but certainly not unheard of in this field.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business students, like ambition, leadership, or a strong interest in finance/economics. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** This assessment relies on general stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and nature-loving, and many computer science students might not fit the "quiet" description. 
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a very limited view of Adam's personality.  His actual interests and motivations could easily sway the probabilities in either direction.
