Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch could describe someone in either field:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "good at understanding abstract concepts" align strongly with stereotypes of computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and a quiet demeanor, which are less stereotypically associated with business administration programs.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative and rely on broad generalizations. It's crucial to avoid using such sketches for real-world profiling or decision-making about individuals.  Personality traits are not exclusive to any field of study.
