Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes traits often associated with individuals drawn to computer science:
    *  **Problem-solving:** "enjoys solving puzzles" is a strong indicator.
    * **Abstract Thinking:** "good at understanding abstract concepts" is highly relevant to computer science.
    * **Intelligence:**  A stated "high intelligence" further supports this field.

* **Business Administration:** While some traits like hard work and dedication are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business-oriented individuals, such as:
    *  Interest in economics, finance, or marketing
    *  Strong leadership qualities or desire to manage people 
    *  Explicit mention of ambition or career-driven goals

**Important Note:**  This assessment is based on general stereotypes and probabilities. Individual personalities are diverse, and many students in business administration could possess the traits described.
