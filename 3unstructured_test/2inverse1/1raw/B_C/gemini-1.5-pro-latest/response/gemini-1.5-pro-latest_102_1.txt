Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," "understanding abstract concepts" align strongly with the skills and interests often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While "hard work and dedication" are relevant to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business aspirations like leadership, ambition for financial success, or strong interpersonal/networking skills.  

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches can provide hints, but they are not reliable predictors of a person's field of study. Many other factors influence a person's choice of major.
