Here's an estimated probability based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," "good at understanding abstract concepts" align well with the common perception of individuals drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:**  While "understanding hard work and dedication" could apply to business, the other traits don't have as strong a connection. 

**Important Notes:**

* **This is purely speculative.** Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study.  People's interests and aptitudes are diverse.
* **Individual variation is huge.** Many people in computer science might not fit this description, and many business administration students might. 

Please treat these probabilities with a high degree of caution.
