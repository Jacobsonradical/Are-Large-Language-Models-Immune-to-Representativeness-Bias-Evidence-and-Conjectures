Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned strongly align with a computer science student:
    * **Puzzle solving:** A core element of programming and algorithmic thinking.
    * **High intelligence and abstract thinking:**  Essential for computer science concepts.
    * **Curiosity:**  Driving force behind technological innovation. 

* **Business Administration:** While some traits like hard work and dedication are relevant to business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of a business-oriented personality:
    * **Nature and animal love:** Not as directly relevant to business.
    * **Quiet and empathetic:** While not exclusive to any field, these traits are less typical of the stereotypical image of a business student.

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on stereotypes and probabilities. It's entirely possible for individuals with this personality to thrive in either field.  Personality sketches offer limited information, and actual career choices are influenced by a much wider range of factors.
