Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence. These traits are strongly associated with computer science, making it a more likely field for Adam. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, risk-taking, or a focus on finance and management. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective and based on stereotypes associated with these fields.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and nature-loving, and many computer scientists share a passion for animals. This assessment is simply based on the likelihood given the limited information provided.
