Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are just educated guesses based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence. These traits are often associated with computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes qualities like empathy and a love for nature which aren't as stereotypically linked to business administration.

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on general perceptions.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and nature-loving, while some computer science students might not fit the described personality. It's crucial to avoid over-generalizing.
