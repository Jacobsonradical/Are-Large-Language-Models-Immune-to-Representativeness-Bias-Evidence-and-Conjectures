Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The description emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles"), abstract reasoning, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature, empathy, and a "quiet" demeanor aligns less strongly with the stereotypical image of a business administration student.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study. There are many people who love nature and are highly empathetic within business and computer science!
