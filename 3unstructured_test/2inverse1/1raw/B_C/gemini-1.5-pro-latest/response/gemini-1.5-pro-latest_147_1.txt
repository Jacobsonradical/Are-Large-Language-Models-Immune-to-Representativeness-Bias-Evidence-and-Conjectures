Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. The love for nature and animals, while not exclusive to CS, doesn't contradict it either.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business-oriented interests like leadership, finance, or market dynamics. The emphasis on empathy and nature aligns less with common perceptions of the field.

**Important Disclaimer:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic pursuits. Many individuals with the described traits excel in business, while others with different personalities succeed in computer science.
