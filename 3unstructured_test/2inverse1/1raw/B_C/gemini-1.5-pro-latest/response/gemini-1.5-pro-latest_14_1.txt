Here's my assessment of the probabilities, along with the reasoning:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The personality sketch emphasizes puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science. While a love for nature isn't a stereotype of the field, it's not uncommon and could indicate an interest in bioinformatics or computational biology. 

* **Business Administration:** The sketch's emphasis on empathy and understanding hard work could suggest an interest in management and organizational behavior, which are part of business administration. However, the core traits (nature, puzzles, abstract concepts) align less strongly with the stereotypical image of a business student.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions of these fields.  Many individuals in both fields defy these stereotypes.
* **Individual Variation:** Personality is just one factor in choosing a field of study. Adam's specific interests, skills, and experiences could easily lead him to either field. 
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality, but doesn't offer information about his specific academic background, career goals, or other interests that might influence his field of study.
