Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very subjective and based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes analytical skills ("solving puzzles"), abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. The love for nature might be less common but doesn't exclude this field.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the description lacks a strong emphasis on traits often linked to this field, like leadership, ambition, or financial interest.  

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study. 
* Many individuals in business administration possess the traits described, and many computer science students might not fit this profile.
* This assessment relies on general perceptions of these fields and doesn't account for individual variations.
