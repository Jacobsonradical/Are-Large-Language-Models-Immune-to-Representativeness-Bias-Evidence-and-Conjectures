Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," "good at understanding abstract concepts" strongly align with the skills and interests often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While some aspects like "understanding hard work and dedication" could apply to business students, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing. 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on stereotypes.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. Many individuals in business administration could have these traits, and many computer science students might not.
