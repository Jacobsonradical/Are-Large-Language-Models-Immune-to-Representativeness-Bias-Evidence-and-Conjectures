Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned strongly align with a computer science student:
    * **Problem-solving:** Puzzles are a common analogy for coding challenges.
    * **Abstract thinking:**  CS requires strong abstract reasoning skills.
    * **Intelligence:**  The field often attracts high-intelligence individuals.

* **Business Administration:** While some traits (hard work, dedication) are valuable in business, the description leans more towards a scientifically inclined individual. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Personality isn't destiny:** This is a probabilistic assessment based on stereotypes. Many people in business administration are nature lovers and animal enthusiasts.  
* **Individual variation:**  There's a wide range of personalities within any field. 
* **Limited information:** The sketch doesn't provide specific details that would strongly confirm or deny either field.
