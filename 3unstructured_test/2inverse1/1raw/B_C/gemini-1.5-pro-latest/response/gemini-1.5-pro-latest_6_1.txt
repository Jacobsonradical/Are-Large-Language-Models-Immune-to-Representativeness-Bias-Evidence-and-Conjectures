Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch might relate to the fields and a probability estimate:

**Probability Assessment:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, understanding abstract concepts, high intelligence) align strongly with skills often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, animals, and potentially less common interests for this field.

**Probabilities (Based on the sketch alone):**

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative and based solely on a brief personality sketch.  Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
