Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes abstract thinking, puzzle-solving, and high intelligence â€“ all traits commonly associated with computer science students.  The love for nature and animals, while not exclusive to CS, doesn't contradict it either.

* **Business Administration:** While business administration programs attract a diverse range of students, the sketch's emphasis on nature, empathy, and understanding hard work doesn't strongly signal a typical business student. 

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are subjective and based on stereotypes. There's a wide range of personalities within any field of study.  
* The sketch provides limited information, making it difficult to give highly confident probabilities.
