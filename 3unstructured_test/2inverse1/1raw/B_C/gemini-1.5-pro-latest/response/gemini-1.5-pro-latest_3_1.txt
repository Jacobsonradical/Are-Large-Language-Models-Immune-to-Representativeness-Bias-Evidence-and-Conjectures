Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (enjoying puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, high intelligence) strongly align with common perceptions of individuals drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While someone in business administration could possess these traits, they aren't as specifically indicative of the field. The emphasis on nature, empathy, and love for animals might be seen as less typical interests for someone pursuing a business path.

**Important Notes:**

* These are just probabilities based on stereotypes and the limited information provided. There's a wide range of personalities within any field.  
* Individual interests and experiences vary greatly. Many factors beyond personality influence a person's choice of study.
