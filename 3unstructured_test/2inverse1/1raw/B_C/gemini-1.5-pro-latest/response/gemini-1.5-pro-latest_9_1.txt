Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited stereotypical correlations:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. While a love for nature isn't a defining computer science characteristic, it's not uncommon and doesn't strongly contradict the profile.

* **Business Administration:** The sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, ambition for financial success, or strong communication skills. The emphasis on empathy and love for animals, while positive traits, might be considered less typical for someone drawn to the business world.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of academic fields. Many other factors influence a person's choice of study.
