Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles"), understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. The love for nature and animals, while not exclusive to CS, doesn't contradict it either. 
* **Business Administration:** While "hard work and dedication" could apply to business students, the other traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) are less typical markers for this field. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality isn't destiny:**  This is a highly subjective exercise.  People's personalities are complex, and there are successful individuals in every field who defy stereotypes. 
* **Limited information:**  We have a brief sketch and a single data point (graduate student in 2021). More information about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would lead to a more accurate assessment.
