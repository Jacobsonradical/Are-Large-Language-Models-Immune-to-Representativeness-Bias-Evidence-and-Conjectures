Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose guidelines:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with those drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with business aspirations, such as leadership, risk-taking, or a focus on financial success. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality is not destiny:** These are just probabilities based on stereotypes. Many individuals in computer science are deeply empathetic and nature-loving, and many business professionals excel in puzzle-solving and abstract thought.
* **Limited information:** The sketch is brief.  More details about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would drastically change the probability assessment.
