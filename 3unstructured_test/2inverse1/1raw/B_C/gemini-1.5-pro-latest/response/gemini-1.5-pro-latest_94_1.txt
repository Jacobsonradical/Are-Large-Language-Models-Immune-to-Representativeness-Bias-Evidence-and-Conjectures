Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.7):** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence. These traits align strongly with the skills and aptitudes valued in computer science. The love for nature and animals isn't a contradiction, as many computer scientists have diverse interests.

* **Business Administration (0.3):** While some aspects of the sketch (hard work, dedication) are relevant to business administration, the strong emphasis on nature, empathy, and abstract thinking is less typical.  Business administration often attracts individuals with a stronger interest in leadership, strategy, and interpersonal dynamics.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on general stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field are incredibly diverse.
