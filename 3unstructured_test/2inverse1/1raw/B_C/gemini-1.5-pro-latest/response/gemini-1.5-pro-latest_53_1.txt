Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind that this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (0.6):**  The traits "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are strong indicators often associated with computer science students. 
* **Business Administration (0.3):** While some personality traits (hard work, dedication) could apply to business students, the sketch lacks strong indicators usually associated with this field, like leadership, ambition, or strong communication skills. The love for nature and animals might be considered slightly less common in a typical business-oriented personality, though there are always exceptions. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that personality sketches are not foolproof methods for determining someone's field of study. People are diverse, and these are just probabilities based on general tendencies.
