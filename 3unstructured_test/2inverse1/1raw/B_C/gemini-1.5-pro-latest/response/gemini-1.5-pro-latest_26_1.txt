Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch might relate to the given fields, and my estimated probabilities:

**Analysis:**

* **Curiosity about nature:** This trait is not strongly associated with either computer science or business administration. 
* **Quiet, puzzle-solving:** This aligns well with the stereotype of a computer science student.
* **Warm heart, empathy, love for animals:**  These traits are not typical markers for either field, though they might be found in individuals within any field.
* **High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts:**  This is applicable to both fields, though perhaps more traditionally associated with computer science.
* **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:**  Important for both fields.

**Probabilities:**

Considering the above analysis, the personality sketch leans slightly towards a computer science student. However, it's important to remember that these are just stereotypes and many individuals in business administration share similar traits.

Here's my best estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on limited information and general stereotypes. It's impossible to accurately determine someone's field of study solely based on a personality sketch.
