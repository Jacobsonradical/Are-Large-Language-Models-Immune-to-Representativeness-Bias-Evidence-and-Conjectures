Here's my assessment of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "understanding abstract concepts" strongly align with typical characteristics associated with computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While someone in business administration can certainly possess these traits, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and love for animals might be less common focal points compared to someone in a more analytical and technical field like computer science.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on general stereotypes and the provided personality sketch. There's a wide range of personalities within any field, and this is a simplified analysis.
