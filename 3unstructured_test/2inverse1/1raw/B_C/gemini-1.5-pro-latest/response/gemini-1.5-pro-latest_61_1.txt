Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. The love for nature and animals, while not exclusive to this field, doesn't contradict it.
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with this field, like leadership, ambition, or a focus on financial success. The emphasis on empathy and love for nature might be seen as less typical for business-oriented individuals.

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on stereotypes.  Personality sketches are insufficient to accurately predict someone's field of study. Many individuals in business administration could have these traits, and many computer science students might not.
