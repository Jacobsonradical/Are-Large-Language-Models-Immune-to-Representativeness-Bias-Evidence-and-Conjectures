Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  His love for nature doesn't exclude this possibility.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests (e.g., leadership, finance, marketing). The emphasis on empathy and nature aligns less strongly with common perceptions of this field.

**Important Note:**  These are just estimations based on limited information and stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration possess empathy, and many computer scientists love nature. The actual probability depends heavily on individual variations within those fields.
