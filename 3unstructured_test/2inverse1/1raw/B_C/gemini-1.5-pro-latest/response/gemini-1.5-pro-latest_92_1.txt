Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose guidelines:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests (leadership, finance, marketing). The emphasis on nature and empathy might suggest a less common fit for traditional business paths.

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality isn't destiny:**  These are just probabilities based on stereotypes. Many variations exist within each field, and individuals often defy expectations.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch is brief. More details about Adam's specific skills, interests, and goals would lead to a more accurate assessment.
