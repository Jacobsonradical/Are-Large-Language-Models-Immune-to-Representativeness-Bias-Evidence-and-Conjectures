Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and a very short personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality description lacks a strong indication of traits typically associated with business, such as leadership, ambition, or strong communication skills.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and generalizations. Many individuals in business administration could easily fit the personality description, and many computer science students might not. **Personality is not a reliable predictor of academic field.**
