Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals doesn't typically align as strongly with the field.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid strong biases. Many individuals in business administration may share the described traits, and conversely, not all computer science students fit this profile. These probabilities are simply estimations based on general perceptions.
