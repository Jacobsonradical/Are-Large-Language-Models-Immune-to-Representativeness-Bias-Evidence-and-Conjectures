Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence. These traits are strongly associated with computer science, making it a more likely field for Adam.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy can be valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with someone drawn to business administration, such as leadership, ambition for financial success, or interest in markets and management. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective assessment based on limited information.  Personality sketches can be misleading, and many individuals in business administration possess the traits mentioned.  This estimate is for probability only, and does not definitively place Adam in either field.
