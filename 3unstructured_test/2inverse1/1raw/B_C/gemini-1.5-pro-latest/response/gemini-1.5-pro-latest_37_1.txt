Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the profile lacks strong indicators of typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing. The emphasis on empathy and nature might be seen as less common in a stereotypical business student. 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study. Many individuals in computer science share the described traits, but so do people in numerous other fields.  It's crucial to avoid overgeneralizing based on personality alone.
