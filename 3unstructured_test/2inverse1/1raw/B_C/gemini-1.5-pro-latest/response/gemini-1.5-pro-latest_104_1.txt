Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:**  The traits mentioned like "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "understanding abstract concepts" strongly align with skills and interests common in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While "hard work and dedication" are relevant to business administration, the other traits are less specific and could apply to many fields.  

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches can offer hints about a person's interests, but they are not definitive predictors of academic choices. Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
