Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, intelligence) align strongly with the common perception of computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch emphasizes empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature. These traits are not as stereotypical for business administration students compared to computer science.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on general tendencies.  Many individuals in business administration could have these traits, and many computer science students might not.  It's crucial to avoid using such sketches for making assumptions about individuals in real-life situations.
