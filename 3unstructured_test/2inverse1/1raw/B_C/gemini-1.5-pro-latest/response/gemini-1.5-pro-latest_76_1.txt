Here's an estimated probability based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence â€“ all traits commonly associated with computer science students. The love for nature and empathy, while not exclusive to CS, don't contradict the profile.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business students like leadership, ambition for financial success, or strong interpersonal/persuasion skills.  

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative. Personality sketches offer limited insight, and many individuals in business administration might share the described traits.  Furthermore, this is a simplified assessment and doesn't consider other factors like Adam's specific interests within each field or the program structures at his university.
