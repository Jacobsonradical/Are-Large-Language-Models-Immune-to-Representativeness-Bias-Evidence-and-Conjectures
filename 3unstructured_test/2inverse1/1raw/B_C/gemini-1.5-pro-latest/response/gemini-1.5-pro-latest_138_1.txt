Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love of nature and animals could suggest an interest in bioinformatics or computational biology, which fall under the computer science umbrella. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the profile lacks strong indicators of traits typically associated with business students, such as ambition, leadership, or a strong interest in finance/economics. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are very rough estimations.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of academic pursuits. Many other factors influence a person's field of study.
