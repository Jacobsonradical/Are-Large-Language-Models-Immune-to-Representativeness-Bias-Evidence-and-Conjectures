Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles"), understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ all traits commonly associated with computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing. The love for nature and empathy might suggest a less common path within business, perhaps focusing on sustainability or ethical business practices.

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on stereotypes and general tendencies. There are certainly individuals who defy these expectations, making it impossible to definitively determine Adam's field of study based solely on the provided sketch.
