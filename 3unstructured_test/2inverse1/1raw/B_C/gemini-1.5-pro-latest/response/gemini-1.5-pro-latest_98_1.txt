Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "good at understanding abstract concepts" align well with the typical profile of someone drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the description doesn't strongly point to a business inclination. The emphasis on nature, animals, and possibly a quieter disposition makes a business path seem less likely.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches can offer hints, but they are not reliable predictors of academic or career choices.  Many other factors (personal interests, career goals, financial considerations, etc.)  influence a person's field of study.
