Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch strongly suggests an analytical and abstract mind ("enjoys solving puzzles," "good at understanding abstract concepts").  These traits are highly correlated with computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While "understanding and appreciation for hard work" could apply to business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, marketing, or organizational behavior â€“ common business administration themes.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches can provide hints, but they are not reliable predictors of academic choices. Many individuals with the described traits could thrive in either field.
