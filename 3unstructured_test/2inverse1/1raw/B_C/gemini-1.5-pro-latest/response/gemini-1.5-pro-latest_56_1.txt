Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The profile emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  While a love for nature isn't a stereotype for the field, it's not mutually exclusive. 
* **Business Administration:**  This profile doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, they are not as uniquely suggestive as the traits pointing towards computer science.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases. This assessment is based on limited information and general perceptions. Many individuals with these personality traits excel in business or other fields entirely.
