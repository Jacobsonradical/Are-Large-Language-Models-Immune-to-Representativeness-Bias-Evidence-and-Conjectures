Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) strongly align with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes a love for nature and animals, which might be less common motivators in that field.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information. Many individuals in business administration could have these traits, and many computer science students might not. It's crucial to avoid overgeneralizing based on stereotypes.
