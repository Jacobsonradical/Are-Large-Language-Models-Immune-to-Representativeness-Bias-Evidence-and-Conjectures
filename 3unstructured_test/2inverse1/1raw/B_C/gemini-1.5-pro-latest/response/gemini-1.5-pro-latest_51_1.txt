Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles"), understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love of nature and animals doesn't contradict this. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business, the sketch lacks a clear emphasis on typical business-oriented traits like leadership, ambition, or financial interest. The strong affinity for nature and empathy might be seen as less common in a business-focused individual, though not impossible. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. Many other factors influence career choices.
