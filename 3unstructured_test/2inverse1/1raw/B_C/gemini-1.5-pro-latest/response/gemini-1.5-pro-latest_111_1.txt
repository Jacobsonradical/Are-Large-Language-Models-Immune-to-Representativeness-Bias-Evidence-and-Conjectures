Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "good at understanding abstract concepts" align strongly with the common perception of individuals drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While someone in business administration could certainly possess some of the mentioned qualities (empathy, hard work), the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with a business-oriented personality (e.g., leadership, risk-taking, strong communication). 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on stereotypes and general tendencies.  People are diverse, and there are certainly individuals passionate about nature and animals within business administration, just as there are highly empathetic computer scientists. This assessment merely reflects a likelihood based on commonly perceived personality traits associated with these fields.
