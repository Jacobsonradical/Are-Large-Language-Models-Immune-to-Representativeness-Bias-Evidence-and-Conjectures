Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "understanding abstract concepts" align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business-oriented interests (e.g., leadership, finance, marketing). The love for nature and animals might be seen as less common in a stereotypical business student. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of academic majors. People are diverse, and many individuals in business fields could easily fit the described personality.
