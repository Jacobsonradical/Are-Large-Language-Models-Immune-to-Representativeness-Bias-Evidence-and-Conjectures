Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is quite open:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "good at understanding abstract concepts" align well with the common perception of computer science students. The connection to nature and animals is less stereotypical, but not uncommon. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a drive for the competitive or financially-focused aspects often associated with business administration.  

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases based on personality.  Many individuals in business administration are empathetic and nature-loving, and many computer scientists don't fit the "puzzle-solver" mold. This breakdown is for probabilistic estimation based on *common stereotypes* and the provided information *alone*.
