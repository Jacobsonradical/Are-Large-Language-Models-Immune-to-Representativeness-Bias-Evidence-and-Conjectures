Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch provides limited information:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While "hard work and dedication" are relevant to business, they are general traits. 
* **Computer Science:**  The description aligns better with a computer science student:
    * "Enjoys solving puzzles" is a strong indicator, often associated with computational thinking.
    * "Understanding abstract concepts" is crucial for computer science.
    *  While not definitive, "quiet boy" might align with stereotypes of the field.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions of these fields and should not be interpreted as definitive.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and many computer scientists are very outgoing.
* **Individual Variation:** There's huge variation within any field. This sketch might describe a future ecologist or veterinarian just as easily. 
* **Limited Information:** The personality sketch is brief. More information about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would lead to a more accurate assessment.
