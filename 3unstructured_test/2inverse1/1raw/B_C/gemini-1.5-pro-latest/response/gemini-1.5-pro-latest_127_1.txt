Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles"), abstract reasoning, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with successful computer science students.  The love of nature and empathy, while not stereotypical, don't contradict this possibility. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with business aspirations, such as leadership, ambition for financial success, or strong interpersonal skills.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches provide limited information, and many individuals in business administration could possess the traits described.  Similarly, many computer science students might not fit this description.
