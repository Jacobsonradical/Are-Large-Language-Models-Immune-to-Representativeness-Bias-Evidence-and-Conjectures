Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts â€“ all traits commonly associated with computer science students. The connection to nature and animals is less stereotypical, but not incompatible. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing. The emphasis on nature and animals doesn't strongly align with the field.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid over-relying on stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and connected to nature, and many computer scientists are passionate about animal welfare. This assessment is simply based on the likelihood given common perceptions of these fields.
