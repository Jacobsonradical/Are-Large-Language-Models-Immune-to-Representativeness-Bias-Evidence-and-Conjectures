Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) strongly align with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and animals. These aren't traits traditionally associated with business, making it seem less likely.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and generalizations. There are plenty of individuals in business administration who are deeply empathetic and love nature, just as there are computer science students who might not fit the described personality.
