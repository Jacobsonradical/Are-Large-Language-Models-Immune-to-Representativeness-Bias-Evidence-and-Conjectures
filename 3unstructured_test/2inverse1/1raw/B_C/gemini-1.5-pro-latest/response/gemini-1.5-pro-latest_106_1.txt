Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are strong indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science.  While not exclusive to the field, these skills are highly valued.
* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch doesn't offer as many direct correlations to business administration. While "understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication" is positive, it's not specific enough to suggest a high likelihood. The other traits are not as commonly associated with a strong inclination toward business administration. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on stereotypes and limited information.  Many individuals in computer science might not fit this description, and many business administration students could possess these traits. It's crucial to avoid using such sketches for making real-world judgments about individuals.
