Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a very brief personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "good at understanding abstract concepts" align strongly with the common perception of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While "hard work and dedication" are relevant to business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of traits often associated with business students, such as strong interpersonal skills, leadership qualities, or interest in economics/finance. 

**Important Note:** Personality sketches are far too general to accurately predict someone's field of study. There are many individuals with these traits in both business and computer science, as well as in countless other fields.
