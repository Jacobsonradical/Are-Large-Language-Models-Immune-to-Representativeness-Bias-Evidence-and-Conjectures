Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch and some very general stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description heavily leans towards traits often associated with individuals drawn to computer science: puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits typically associated with business aspirations, such as leadership, risk-taking, or strong communication skills.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to emphasize that these are just rough estimates based on limited information.  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of academic choices. Many individuals with these traits excel in fields completely different from computer science or business administration.
