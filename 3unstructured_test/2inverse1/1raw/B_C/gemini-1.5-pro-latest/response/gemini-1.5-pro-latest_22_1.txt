Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", and "good at understanding abstract concepts" align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students.  The love of nature and animals is less common but not unheard of in the field.
* **Business Administration:**  While "understanding hard work and dedication" is relevant to business, the other traits (love of nature, puzzles, abstract concepts) are less typical.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities are based on general impressions. There are many individuals in business administration who love nature and are great puzzle solvers, just as there are computer science students who might not fit the described personality.
* **Individual Variation:** Personality is complex.  This sketch provides some clues but isn't enough to definitively predict someone's field of study.
