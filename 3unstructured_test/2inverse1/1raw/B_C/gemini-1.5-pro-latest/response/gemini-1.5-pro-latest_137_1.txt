Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes traits often associated with individuals drawn to computer science: puzzle-solving aptitude, abstract thinking, and high intelligence. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits typically associated with business aspirations, such as leadership, risk-taking, or a focus on financial success.

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are based on stereotypes and generalizations. Many individuals in business administration possess the traits described, and many computer science students may not.  
* The sketch provides limited information. Other factors like Adam's upbringing, socioeconomic background, and specific interests could significantly influence his field of study.
