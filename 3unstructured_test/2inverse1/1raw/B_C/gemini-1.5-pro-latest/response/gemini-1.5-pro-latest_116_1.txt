Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description heavily emphasizes analytical skills ("solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "abstract concepts"). These are strong indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and analytical skills are useful in business, the description lacks traits often associated with business students, like ambition, leadership, or strong communication skills. The emphasis on empathy and love for nature might suggest a less traditional career path.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember these are just educated guesses.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic, and many computer scientists have a passion for nature. This exercise relies on broad generalizations and shouldn't be used to profile real people.
