Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "good at understanding abstract concepts" align strongly with the profile of someone interested in computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While "understanding hard work and dedication" could apply to business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business-oriented traits (e.g., leadership, risk-taking, financial acumen). The love for nature and animals might suggest a less common personality type for this field.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on stereotypes and generalizations. Many individuals in business administration might possess the traits described, and many computer science students might not. This is simply a probabilistic assessment based on common perceptions.
