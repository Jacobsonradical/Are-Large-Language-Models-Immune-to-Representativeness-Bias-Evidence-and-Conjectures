Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch aligns with the fields and estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," "good at understanding abstract concepts" strongly align with the skills and interests common in computer science students.  The love of nature and animals is less directly relevant but doesn't contradict the profile.

* **Business Administration:**  While "hard work and dedication" are valued in business, the other traits are less indicative of a strong inclination towards this field.  Business programs often attract individuals with strong interpersonal skills and an interest in leadership, aspects not prominently mentioned in the sketch.

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly subjective.  Personality sketches provide limited information, and many individuals with these traits may be drawn to diverse fields.
* Success and fulfillment in any field depend on a complex interplay of factors beyond personality, such as skills, interests, opportunities, and work ethic.
