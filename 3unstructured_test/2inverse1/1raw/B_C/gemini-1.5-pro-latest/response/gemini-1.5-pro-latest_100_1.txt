Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence. These traits are strongly associated with computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch lacks clear indicators of a strong interest in business, finance, or management. The emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals points away from a typical business administration student profile. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective assessment based on stereotypes.  Many individuals in business administration could have the described traits, and some computer science students might not. This is simply a probabilistic interpretation of the given information.
