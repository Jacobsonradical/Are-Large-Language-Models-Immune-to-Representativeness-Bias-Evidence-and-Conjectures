Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles"), understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  His love for nature doesn't contradict this. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business-oriented interests (e.g., leadership, finance, marketing). The traits mentioned could apply to a variety of fields.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly subjective.  Personality sketches offer limited information, and many individuals in business administration could easily possess the described traits (and vice versa).
