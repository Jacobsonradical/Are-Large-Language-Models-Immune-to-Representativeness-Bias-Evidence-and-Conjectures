Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) strongly align with the skills and interests often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While some aspects (hard work, dedication) are relevant to business administration, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with the field, such as leadership, risk-taking, or a focus on finance and marketing.  

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches offer limited information, and many individuals in business administration could possess the traits described. These probabilities simply reflect a likelihood based on common stereotypes and the information provided.
