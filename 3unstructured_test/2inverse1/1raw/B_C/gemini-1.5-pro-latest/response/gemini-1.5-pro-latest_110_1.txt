Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and a very brief personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits of puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence align strongly with the stereotype of a computer science student. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality description emphasizes nature, empathy, and a quiet demeanor. These traits are not as stereotypical (though not unheard of) in aspiring business professionals. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember these are just educated guesses.  Personality is complex, and people within any field can possess a wide range of interests and traits.
