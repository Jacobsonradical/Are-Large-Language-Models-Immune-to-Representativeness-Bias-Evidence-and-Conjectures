Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, considering the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) strongly align with skills and interests often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes a connection to nature and animals, which might be less common motivators for business students. 

**Important Notes:**

* These are just estimates based on stereotypes.  Many individuals in business administration could have these traits, and many computer science students might not. 
* Individual passions and experiences vary greatly within any field.
