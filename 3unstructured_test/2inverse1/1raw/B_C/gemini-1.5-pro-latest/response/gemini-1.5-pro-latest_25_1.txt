Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," "good at understanding abstract concepts" are strongly associated with individuals drawn to computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** While someone in business administration can certainly possess empathy and a love for animals, these traits are not as strong of indicators as they are for computer science based on the description. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches can offer hints, but they are not reliable predictors of a person's field of study. Many individuals in business fields have a love for nature and animals, and many computer scientists might not fit this personality sketch at all.
