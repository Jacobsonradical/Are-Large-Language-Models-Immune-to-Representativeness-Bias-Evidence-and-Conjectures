Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind that this is based on a very limited personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "good at understanding abstract concepts" are strong indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While some aspects of the personality (hard work, dedication) could apply to business, there's nothing specifically suggesting a strong inclination towards this field.  

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality isn't destiny:**  People's interests and career choices are complex. This sketch doesn't provide enough information for a definitive answer. 
* **Biases:** My own perceptions of these fields might influence the probabilities. 
* **Small Sample Size:** A single personality sketch is statistically insignificant for drawing broad conclusions about entire fields of study.
