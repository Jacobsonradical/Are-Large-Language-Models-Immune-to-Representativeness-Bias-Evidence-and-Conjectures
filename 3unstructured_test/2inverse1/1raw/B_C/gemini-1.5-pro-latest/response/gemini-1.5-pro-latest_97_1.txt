Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles"), abstract reasoning, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love of nature and empathy, while not exclusive to computer science, don't contradict it either.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with business students, such as leadership, ambition for financial success, or strong interpersonal skills. The emphasis on nature and empathy leans slightly away from a typical business student profile. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study. Many individuals in business administration could possess the traits described, and many computer science students might not.
