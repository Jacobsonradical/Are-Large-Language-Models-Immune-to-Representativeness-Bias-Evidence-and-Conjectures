Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence. These traits are highly valued and common in computer science fields. The love of nature and animals isn't a strong indicator either way for computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are important in business, the sketch's emphasis on empathy, quietness, and love for nature aligns less strongly with the typical image of a business administration student. This isn't to say those traits can't exist in business students, but they are less indicative compared to the computer science profile.

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on general stereotypes.  Individual personalities within any field are diverse, and this sketch doesn't provide enough information for a definitive answer.
