Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited stereotypical assumptions:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes a love for nature and animals, which might be less common motivators in that field. 

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on stereotypes.  People's personalities and interests are diverse, and there are many individuals who defy these expectations.
