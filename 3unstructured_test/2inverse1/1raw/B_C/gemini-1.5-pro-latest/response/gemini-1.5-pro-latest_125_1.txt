Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and a love for animals, which are less typical interests for business students.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on general tendencies. It's entirely possible for someone with the described personality to thrive in either field. Individual interests and motivations vary greatly within any field of study.
