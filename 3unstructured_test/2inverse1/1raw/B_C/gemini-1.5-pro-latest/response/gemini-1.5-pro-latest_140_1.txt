Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a very brief personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch's emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals doesn't typically align as strongly with the perceived interests of business students. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches can provide some hints, but they are not reliable for accurately predicting someone's field of study. Many other factors influence a person's choice of major.
