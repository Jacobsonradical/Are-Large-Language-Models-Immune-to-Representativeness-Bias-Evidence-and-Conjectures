Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description heavily emphasizes analytical thinking ("enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "understanding abstract concepts"). These traits are strongly associated with computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While "hard work and dedication" are valued in business, the other traits are less specific to this field.  The sketch lacks clear indicators of interest in finance, marketing, or management.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise.  Personality sketches can offer hints, but they are not reliable predictors of a person's field of study. Many individuals with these traits could be found in both fields.
