Here's an estimated probability breakdown, acknowledging that personality alone isn't a reliable predictor of academic field:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits of puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence align well with common perceptions of computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch emphasizes a connection to nature, empathy, and a love for animals, which are not as stereotypical (though not unheard of) in business students. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative. A wide range of personalities exist within both fields, and there's no way to determine Adam's actual field of study based solely on this sketch.
