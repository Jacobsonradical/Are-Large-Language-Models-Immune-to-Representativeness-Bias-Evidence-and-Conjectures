Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," and "good at understanding abstract concepts" align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the description doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. The emphasis on nature, animals, and potentially solitary pursuits (puzzles) might be seen as less common in a typical business-focused student.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities rely on general assumptions.  Many individuals in business administration are empathetic and nature-loving, and many computer science students may not fit this description.
* **Individual Variation:**  Personality is complex.  There's no single "computer science" or "business administration" personality type. 
* **Limited Information:** The sketch doesn't provide information about Adam's specific goals, career aspirations, or other interests that could dramatically shift the probabilities.
