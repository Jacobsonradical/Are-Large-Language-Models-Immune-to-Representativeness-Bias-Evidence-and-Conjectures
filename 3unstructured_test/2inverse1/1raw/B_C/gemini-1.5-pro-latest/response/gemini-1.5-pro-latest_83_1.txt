Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based solely on a personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science (higher probability):** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," and "good at understanding abstract concepts" align strongly with the skills and interests often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration (lower probability):** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the personality sketch's emphasis on nature, animals, and potentially solitary pursuits (puzzles) suggests a less likely fit for someone drawn to the fast-paced, human-centric world of business administration.

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality sketches are limited:**  People are complex, and personality traits alone are not reliable predictors of career choices.  
* **Graduate programs attract diverse individuals:** Even within fields like computer science, you'll find people with a wide range of interests and hobbies. 
* **These are just estimates:**  Without more information about Adam's specific skills, experiences, and goals, it's impossible to be definitive.
