Here's an estimated probability breakdown based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love of nature and empathy, while not exclusive to CS, don't contradict the stereotype. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing.  The emphasis on nature and empathy points slightly away from a stereotypical business student profile. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Individual Variation:**  Personalities within academic fields are diverse. These probabilities are based on general perceptions and should not be interpreted as definitive judgments about individuals.
* **Limited Information:**  The sketch is brief.  More details about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would lead to a more accurate assessment.
