Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. The love for nature and animals doesn't contradict this.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing.  The emphasis on empathy and nature aligns less strongly with common perceptions of business administration.

**Important Note:** These are just probabilities based on limited information and stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field are diverse.
