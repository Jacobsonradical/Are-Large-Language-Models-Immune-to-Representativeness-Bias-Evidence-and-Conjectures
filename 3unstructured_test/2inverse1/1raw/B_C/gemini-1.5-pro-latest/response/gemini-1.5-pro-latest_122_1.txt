Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. While an interest in nature isn't a direct link, many people in STEM fields appreciate the natural world.
* **Business Administration:** The sketch doesn't strongly suggest traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, ambition, or a focus on financial success. However, empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business contexts.

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are highly subjective.  There are many compassionate and nature-loving individuals in business, just as there are computer scientists who may not fit the described personality. 
* Graduate student populations within these fields are diverse, further reducing the accuracy of any prediction based solely on a personality sketch.
