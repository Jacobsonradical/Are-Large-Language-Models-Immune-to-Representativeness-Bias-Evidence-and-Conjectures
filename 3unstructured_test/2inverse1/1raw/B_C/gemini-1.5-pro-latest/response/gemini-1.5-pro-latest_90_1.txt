Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and a very short personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While the personality sketch doesn't strongly contradict a business administration student, the emphasis on nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work might be seen as less typical (though certainly not impossible) for this field.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration value empathy and nature, and many computer scientists are deeply connected to animals and the natural world. This exercise is more about recognizing potential biases than providing definitive answers.
