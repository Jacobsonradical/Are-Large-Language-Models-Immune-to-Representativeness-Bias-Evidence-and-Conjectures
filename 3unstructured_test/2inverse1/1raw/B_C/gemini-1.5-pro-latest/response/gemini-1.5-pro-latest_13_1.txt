Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) strongly align with skills and interests common in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch emphasizes qualities (love for nature, empathy, curiosity) less directly related to typical business administration pursuits.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative estimate.  Personality sketches offer limited information, and many individuals in business administration could share these traits.  Conversely, some computer science students might not fit this description.
