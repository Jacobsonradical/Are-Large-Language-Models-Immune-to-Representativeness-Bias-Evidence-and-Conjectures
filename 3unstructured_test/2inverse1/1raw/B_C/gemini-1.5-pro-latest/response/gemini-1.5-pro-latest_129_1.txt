Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and a short personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," "good at understanding abstract concepts" are strongly associated with computer science stereotypes. His love for nature doesn't contradict this. 
* **Business Administration:** While "hard work and dedication" are valued in business, the description lacks clear indicators of typical business interests (e.g., leadership, finance, marketing). 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong judgments based on personality alone. People's interests are diverse, and this sketch provides limited information.
