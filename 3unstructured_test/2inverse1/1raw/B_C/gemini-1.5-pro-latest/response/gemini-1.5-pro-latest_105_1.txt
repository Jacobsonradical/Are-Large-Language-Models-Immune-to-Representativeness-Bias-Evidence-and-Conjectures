Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  His enjoyment of puzzles further suggests an affinity for logical thinking common in this field.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with business students, such as  leadership, ambition for financial success, or strong interpersonal/persuasion skills.  

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches can provide hints about a person's interests, but they are not reliable predictors of academic majors. Many other factors (personal experiences, career goals, financial considerations) influence a person's field of study.
