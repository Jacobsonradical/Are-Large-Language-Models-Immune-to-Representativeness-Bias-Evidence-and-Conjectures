Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is quite open-ended:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits of "enjoying solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "understanding abstract concepts" align well with common perceptions of computer science students. The connection to nature and animals is less stereotypical, but not unheard of.

* **Business Administration:** The description doesn't strongly suggest business administration. While "understanding hard work and dedication" is relevant, the other traits are less typical of the field's perceived focus on interpersonal skills, leadership, and market dynamics.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches offer very limited information, and people's interests and career choices are complex.
