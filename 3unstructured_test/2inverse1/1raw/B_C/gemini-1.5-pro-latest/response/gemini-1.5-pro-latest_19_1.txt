Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided is insufficient for a definitive answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with business students, such as leadership, ambition, or a focus on financial success. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes are not always accurate:**  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and love nature, just as many computer science students may not fit the stereotypical mold.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality but doesn't offer insight into his specific career aspirations or skills.

**It's crucial to avoid making assumptions about a person's field of study solely based on personality sketches.**
