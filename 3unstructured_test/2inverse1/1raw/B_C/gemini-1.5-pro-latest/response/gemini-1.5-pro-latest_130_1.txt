Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  His love for nature might indicate an interest in bioinformatics or computational biology, which are subfields within computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of  typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing.  The emphasis on empathy and love for animals might suggest a less conventional business path. 

**Important Note:**  This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches provide limited information, and people within any field can have diverse interests and personalities.
