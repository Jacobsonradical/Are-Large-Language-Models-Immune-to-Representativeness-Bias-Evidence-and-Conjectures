Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like "enjoying solving puzzles," "high intelligence," "understanding abstract concepts" are strong indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators like an interest in economics, leadership, or market dynamics. The description leans more towards a scientific/analytical personality.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative. Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of a person's field of study. Many individuals in computer science could have very different personalities, and some business administration students might fit the provided description.
