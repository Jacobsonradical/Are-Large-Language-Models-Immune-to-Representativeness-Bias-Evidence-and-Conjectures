Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like enjoying puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence align strongly with individuals drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators like an interest in economics, leadership, or market dynamics, making it less likely. 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on stereotypes and probabilities.  There are plenty of individuals in business administration who love nature and animals, and many computer scientists who may not fit this personality profile. It's crucial to avoid overgeneralizing.
