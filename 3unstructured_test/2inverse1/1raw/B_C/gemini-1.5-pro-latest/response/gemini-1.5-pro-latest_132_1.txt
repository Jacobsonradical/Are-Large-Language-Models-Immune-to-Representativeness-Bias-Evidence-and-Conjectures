Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. The love of nature and animals, while not exclusive to computer science, doesn't contradict it either. 
* **Business Administration:**  While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks a strong emphasis on leadership, ambition, or financial drive, which are often associated with business administration students.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and stereotypes.  Many individuals in business administration could have the traits described, and many computer science students might not.  Personality is complex and shouldn't be reduced to field of study.
