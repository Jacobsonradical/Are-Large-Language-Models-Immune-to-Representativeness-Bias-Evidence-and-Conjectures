Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) strongly align with the skills and interests often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes a love for nature and animals. These aren't traits as directly associated with business administration, making it somewhat less likely.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are based on general stereotypes and the provided personality sketch. There's a wide range of personalities within any field of study. This is just an estimation based on limited information.
