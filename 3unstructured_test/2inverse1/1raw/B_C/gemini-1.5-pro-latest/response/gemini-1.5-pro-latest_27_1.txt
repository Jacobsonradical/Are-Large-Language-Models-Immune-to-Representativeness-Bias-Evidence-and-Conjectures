Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind that this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes analytical skills ("solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "understanding abstract concepts") which are strongly associated with computer science.  The "curiosity about nature" could manifest as an interest in bioinformatics or environmental modeling, both of which have computer science applications. 
* **Business Administration:** While someone with this personality could certainly go into business, there's nothing in the description that particularly points towards the core elements of business administration (like leadership, finance, or marketing).  The "appreciation for hard work and dedication" is a general trait.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that personality sketches are not reliable predictors of someone's field of study.  People are diverse, and many personality types can be successful in any field.
