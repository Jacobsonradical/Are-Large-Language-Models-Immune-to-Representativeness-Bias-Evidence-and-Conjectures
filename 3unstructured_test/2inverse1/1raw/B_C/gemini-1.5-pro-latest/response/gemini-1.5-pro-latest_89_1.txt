Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the limited information provided:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love of nature and animals doesn't contradict this and might even suggest an interest in bioinformatics or computational biology.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the profile lacks strong indicators typically associated with business students like ambition, leadership, risk-taking, or a focus on financial success. The emphasis on empathy and love for nature aligns less strongly with common perceptions of business fields. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember these are just probabilities based on limited information and potential biases.  Many individuals in business administration are empathetic and nature-loving, just as many computer science students might not fit this personality sketch.
