Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," "good at understanding abstract concepts" align strongly with the profile of someone interested in computer science.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the description doesn't have strong indicators typically associated with business aspirations (e.g., interest in economics, leadership, market trends). The love for nature and animals might suggest a less common path for a business student.

**Important Notes:**

* These probabilities are based on stereotypes and general tendencies. There are always exceptions. 
* The sketch is somewhat open-ended, so these are educated guesses rather than definitive answers.
