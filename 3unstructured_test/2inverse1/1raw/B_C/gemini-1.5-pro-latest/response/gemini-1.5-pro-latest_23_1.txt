Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) are strongly aligned with skills and interests common in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While someone in business administration can certainly possess these traits, they are not as specifically indicative of the field. The sketch lacks mentions of typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing.

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective assessment based on limited information.  Personality traits can be found in individuals across diverse fields.
