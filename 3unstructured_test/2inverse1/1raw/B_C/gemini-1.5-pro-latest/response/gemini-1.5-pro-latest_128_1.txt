Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose guidelines:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," "good at understanding abstract concepts," and even "curiosity about nature" align well with common perceptions of computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the profile doesn't strongly suggest a draw to the core elements of business like finance, marketing, or management. The emphasis on empathy and love for animals might be seen as less typical in a business-oriented personality (though certainly not impossible).

**Important Notes:**

* **Individual Variation:** Personalities within any field are highly diverse. These probabilities are based on general stereotypes and should not be taken as definitive judgments about individuals.
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality but lacks details about his specific interests, skills, or career aspirations, which are crucial for a more accurate assessment.
