Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (enjoying puzzles, abstract thinking, high intelligence) strongly align with common stereotypes of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the description leans more towards someone who enjoys intellectual pursuits related to nature and potentially scientific thinking.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities are based on general perceptions and don't account for the diversity within each field. There are plenty of nature-loving business students and empathetic computer scientists!
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a narrow view.  Other factors like Adam's specific interests within each field, his upbringing, and his career goals would significantly impact the actual probability.
