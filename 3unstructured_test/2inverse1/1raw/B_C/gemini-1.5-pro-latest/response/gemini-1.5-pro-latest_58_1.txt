Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles"), understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love for nature and animals, while not exclusive to computer science, doesn't contradict it either.

* **Business Administration:** While business administration could attract individuals with a strong work ethic and empathy, the sketch's focus on nature, quietness, and abstract thinking aligns less strongly with the stereotypical image of a business student. 

**Important Note:**  These are just probabilities based on limited information.  Many individuals in business administration could have the traits described, and many computer science students might not. Personality sketches provide a narrow glimpse, not definitive proof.
