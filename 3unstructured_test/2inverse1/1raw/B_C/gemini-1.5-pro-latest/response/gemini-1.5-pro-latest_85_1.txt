Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical thinking ("solving puzzles"), understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. The love for nature and animals, while not exclusive to CS, doesn't contradict it.

* **Business Administration:**  While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing.  The emphasis on nature and quiet contemplation points slightly away from a stereotypical business student profile. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. Many individuals with these traits could be found in either field, and countless other factors influence career choices.
