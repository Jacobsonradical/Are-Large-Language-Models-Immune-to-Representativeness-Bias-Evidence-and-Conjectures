Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) align strongly with the typical profile of someone drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch emphasizes a love for nature, animals, and potentially quiet contemplation. These traits are less typical drivers for pursuing a business administration path.

**Important Note:**  These are just educated guesses based on stereotypes.  Personality is just one factor among many when people choose fields of study.  Interests, personal goals, financial considerations, and life experiences all play a role.
