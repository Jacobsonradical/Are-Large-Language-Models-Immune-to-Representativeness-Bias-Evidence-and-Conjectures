Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits of "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," and "good at understanding abstract concepts" align strongly with the stereotypical image of a computer science student.  His love of nature doesn't contradict this. 
* **Business Administration:** While someone in business administration could certainly possess these traits, they are less directly indicative of the field compared to computer science.  The sketch doesn't mention typical business-oriented interests (finance, leadership, etc.).

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities are based on general perceptions of these fields.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply curious about nature, and many computer scientists might not be as interested in animals.
* **Individual Variation:**  Personality is complex, and there are always exceptions within any field of study. 
* **Limited Information:** The sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's personality but lacks specifics about his skills, career goals, and academic performance.
