Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love of nature and animals doesn't contradict this. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are useful in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business-oriented interests (e.g., leadership, finance, marketing). The emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less common in a stereotypical business student.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise.  Personality sketches are not reliable predictors of academic majors.  Many individuals with these traits could succeed in either field.
