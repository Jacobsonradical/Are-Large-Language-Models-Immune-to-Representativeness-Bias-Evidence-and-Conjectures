Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the description's emphasis on nature, empathy, and animals doesn't typically align as strongly with the field.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are very rough estimations.  Many individuals in business administration could have these traits, and many computer science students might not.  Personality is complex, and field of study is just one small aspect of a person.
