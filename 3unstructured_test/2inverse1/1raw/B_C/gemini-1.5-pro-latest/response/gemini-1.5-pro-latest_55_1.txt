Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are very loose guidelines:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, high intelligence) strongly align with common perceptions of computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the profile leans more towards someone interested in systems and potentially research (given the graduate student status).  

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality is not destiny:**  These are just probabilities based on stereotypes. Many people in business administration are empathetic and nature-loving, just as many computer scientists might not fit this description.
* **Limited information:**  We know very little about Adam's specific skills, interests within his field, or career aspirations. This greatly influences actual career choices.
