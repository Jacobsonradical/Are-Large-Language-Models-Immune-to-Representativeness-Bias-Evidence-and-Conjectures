Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ all traits highly valued in computer science.  The quiet nature and love of puzzles align well with the stereotypical image of a computer scientist. 
* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with business administration, such as leadership, assertiveness, or a strong interest in finance and economics.  The emphasis on empathy and love for nature might be seen as less common (though not unheard of) in a typical business-oriented personality.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly subjective and based on stereotypes.  Many individuals in business administration possess the traits described, and many computer scientists may not fit the stereotype.  It's crucial to avoid making assumptions about individuals based solely on their field of study.
