Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch is potentially consistent with either field:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are often associated with computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While some personality traits (empathy, understanding hard work) are valuable in business, they aren't as stereotypical as the puzzle-solving aspect for computer science.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** This assessment relies on general perceptions of these fields.  Many individuals in business administration are highly analytical and many computer science students are deeply empathetic.
* **Limited Information:**  The personality sketch is brief.  More information about Adam's specific interests, skills, and goals would lead to a more accurate estimation.
