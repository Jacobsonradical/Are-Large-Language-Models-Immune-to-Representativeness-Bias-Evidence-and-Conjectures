Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind that this is based solely on a brief personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical skills ("solving puzzles"), abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science.  The love of nature and animals might be less common but isn't mutually exclusive.

* **Business Administration:** While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, the sketch doesn't strongly suggest a drive for the core aspects of business like leadership, finance, or marketing.  

**Important Note:** Personality sketches are very limited. Many individuals in business administration could have these traits, and many computer science students might not.  These probabilities are simply my best guess based on common stereotypes and the information provided.
