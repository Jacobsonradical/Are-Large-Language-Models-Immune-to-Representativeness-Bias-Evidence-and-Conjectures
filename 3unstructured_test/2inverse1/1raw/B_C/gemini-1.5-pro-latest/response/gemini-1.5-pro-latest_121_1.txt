Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," "understanding abstract concepts" align strongly with the skills and interests often found in computer science students. This suggests a higher probability.
* **Business Administration:** While "hard work and dedication" are valued in business, the personality sketch leans more towards an analytical and nature-loving individual. This doesn't rule out business administration, but makes it seem less likely compared to computer science.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are subjective estimations based on general stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field are incredibly diverse.
