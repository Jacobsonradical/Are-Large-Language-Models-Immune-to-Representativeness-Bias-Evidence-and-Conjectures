Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is highly speculative:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence. These are highly valued traits in computer science, making it a more likely field for Adam.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are relevant to business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with business pursuits, such as leadership, ambition, or a focus on financial success.

**Important Notes:**

* **Personality isn't destiny:** People's interests and career choices are complex. This sketch provides some clues, but many individuals with these traits excel in diverse fields.
* **Limited information:** We only have a brief snapshot of Adam.  Factors like upbringing, specific interests within each field, and personal experiences significantly influence career choices.

This assessment is based on general stereotypes and probabilities. It's crucial to avoid using such estimations to make assumptions about individuals in real-life situations.
