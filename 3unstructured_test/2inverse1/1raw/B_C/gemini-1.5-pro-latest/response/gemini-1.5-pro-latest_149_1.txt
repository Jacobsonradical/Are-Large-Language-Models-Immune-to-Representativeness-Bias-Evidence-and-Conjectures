Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving â€“ traits often associated with computer science students. The love for nature and animals isn't a strong indicator either way.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks indicators of a strong interest in economics, finance, or management, which are core to business administration.  The emphasis on empathy and a love for nature might be seen as less common in this field.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are highly subjective and based on general stereotypes. Individual personalities within any field can vary greatly.
