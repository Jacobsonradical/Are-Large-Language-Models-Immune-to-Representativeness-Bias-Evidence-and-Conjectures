Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the information provided is insufficient for a truly accurate assessment:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes analytical skills ("solving puzzles"), abstract thinking, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love of nature and empathy, while not exclusive to CS, don't contradict this likelihood.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business-oriented traits (e.g., leadership, ambition, risk-taking, strong communication). The emphasis on nature and empathy might be seen as less common in a stereotypical business student profile. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on general perceptions and not on individual merit. Many computer science students are deeply empathetic, and many business students have a passion for nature.
* **Limited Information:**  The sketch provides a narrow view of Adam's personality.  Hobbies, experiences, and other factors could significantly alter the probability.
