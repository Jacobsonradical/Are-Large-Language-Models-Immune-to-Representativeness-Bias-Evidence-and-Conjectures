Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on a very brief personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," "good at understanding abstract concepts" are more stereotypically associated with computer science students. This suggests a higher probability. 
* **Business Administration:** While "understanding and appreciation for hard work" could apply to business students, the sketch lacks strong indicators usually associated with business interests, like leadership, communication skills, or financial acumen. This leads to a lower probability.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  My reasoning relies on common stereotypes.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of someone's field of study.  
* **Limited Information:**  The sketch is very short. More details about Adam's interests, hobbies, and skills would drastically change the probability assessment.
