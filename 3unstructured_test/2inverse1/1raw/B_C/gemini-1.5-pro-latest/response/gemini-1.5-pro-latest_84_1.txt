Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Curiosity about nature and love for animals:** While not exclusive to any field, these traits are less commonly associated with stereotypical business administration personalities.  
* **Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts:** These strongly suggest an aptitude for fields like computer science, mathematics, or engineering.
* **Quiet boy, warm heart, strong empathy:** These traits could apply to individuals in many fields, including business administration, but they don't inherently point towards one over the other.

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on stereotypes and limited information. There are many compassionate and nature-loving individuals in business administration, and many quiet, puzzle-solving individuals thrive outside of computer science.  Personality sketches provide a glimpse, not a complete picture.
