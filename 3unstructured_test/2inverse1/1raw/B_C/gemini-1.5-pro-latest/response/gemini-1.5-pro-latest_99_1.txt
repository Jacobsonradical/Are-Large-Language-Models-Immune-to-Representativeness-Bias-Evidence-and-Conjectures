Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, intelligence) strongly align with common perceptions of computer science students. The love for nature and animals doesn't contradict this and could indicate a well-rounded personality.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the other traits (empathy, love for nature and animals) are less typical indicators for this field. It's possible, but the profile leans more towards a STEM field like computer science. 

**Important Note:** These probabilities are speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. Many other factors influence career choices.
