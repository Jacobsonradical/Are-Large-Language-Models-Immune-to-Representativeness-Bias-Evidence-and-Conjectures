Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and limited information:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and high intelligence - traits often associated with computer science students. The love for nature doesn't contradict this and could indicate an interest in bioinformatics or computational biology.

* **Business Administration:**  While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the description lacks a strong indication of traits often associated with business students like leadership, competitiveness, or a strong interest in economics/finance. 

**Important Note:** Personality sketches are not reliable for predicting career choices. Many individuals with these traits excel in various fields.
