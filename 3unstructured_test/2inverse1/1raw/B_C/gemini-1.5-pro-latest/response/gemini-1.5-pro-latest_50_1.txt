Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited stereotypical correlations:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description emphasizes problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and intelligence â€“ traits often associated with computer science students.  The love of nature might be less common but certainly not unheard of. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valuable in business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with business students, such as ambition, leadership, or a strong interest in finance/economics. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:**  These probabilities are based on general perceptions and do not reflect the full diversity of individuals within each field. 
* **Limited Information:** The personality sketch provides a glimpse into Adam's character but lacks specific information about his skills, interests, or career goals, which are crucial for a more accurate prediction.
