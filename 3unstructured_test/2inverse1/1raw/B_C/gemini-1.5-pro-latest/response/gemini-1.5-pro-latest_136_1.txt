Here's my assessment of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on limited information and stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description heavily emphasizes intellectual curiosity, puzzle-solving abilities, and understanding abstract concepts. These are strong indicators of someone who might be drawn to computer science.
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the description lacks strong indicators of traits often associated with business administration, such as leadership, risk-taking, or a strong interest in economics/finance. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on a very limited sketch.  People are complex, and this description doesn't provide enough information for a confident prediction of someone's field of study.
