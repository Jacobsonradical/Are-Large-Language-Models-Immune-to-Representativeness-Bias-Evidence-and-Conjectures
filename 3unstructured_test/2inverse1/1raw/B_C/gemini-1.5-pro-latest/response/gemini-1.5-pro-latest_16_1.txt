Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch's details:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", "good at understanding abstract concepts" align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students.  The love of nature and animals isn't a *contradiction*, just less stereotypical.
* **Business Administration:** While "hard work and dedication" applies to many fields, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests (leadership, finance, marketing).  Empathy and a love for animals aren't *exclusive* of business, but don't boost the likelihood.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** These probabilities are based on broad generalizations.  Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic, and many in computer science may not be outdoorsy.
* **Individual Variation:**  Even if the sketch perfectly described a typical student in one field, it doesn't guarantee Adam fits that mold. Personalities are diverse.
* **Missing Information:** Knowing Adam's undergraduate major, hobbies, or career goals would drastically change the probabilities.
