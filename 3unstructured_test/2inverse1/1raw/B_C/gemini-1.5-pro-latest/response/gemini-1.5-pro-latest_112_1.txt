Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (enjoying puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, high intelligence) strongly align with typical characteristics of individuals drawn to computer science. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing. The emphasis on nature and animals doesn't directly relate to the field.

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on stereotypes and common associations with these fields.  Many individuals in business administration might possess the traits described, and many computer science students might not. Individual personalities are diverse and complex.
