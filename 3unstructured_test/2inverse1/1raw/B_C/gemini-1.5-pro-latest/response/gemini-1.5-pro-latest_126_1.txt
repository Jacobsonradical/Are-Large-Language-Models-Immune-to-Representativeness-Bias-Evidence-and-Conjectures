Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind these are just educated guesses based on stereotypes:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description strongly leans towards a computer science student due to these points:
    * **Puzzle Solving:**  A core element of programming and computer science.
    * **Abstract Concepts:** Understanding abstract concepts is crucial in computer science.
    * **High Intelligence:**  Often associated with success in computer science fields.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence, hard work, and dedication are valuable in business, the personality sketch lacks strong indicators commonly associated with business students, such as:
    *  Strong interest in economics, finance, or marketing.
    *  Outgoing personality or leadership traits (though not always required). 

**Important Note:**  Personality sketches are not foolproof for determining someone's field of study.  People are diverse, and many with these traits could excel in various fields, including those not listed.
