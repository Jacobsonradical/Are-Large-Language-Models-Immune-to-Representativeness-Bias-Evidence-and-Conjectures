Here's a breakdown of the probabilities, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the sketch provides limited information:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Business Administration:** The personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest a business inclination. While empathy and understanding hard work are valuable in business, they aren't specific indicators. 
* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles", "high intelligence", and "good at understanding abstract concepts" are often associated with individuals drawn to computer science. This makes it slightly more likely.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that these are just probabilities based on limited information and common stereotypes. Many individuals in business administration are deeply empathetic and love nature, just as many computer scientists might not fit the described personality. This exercise is for understanding probabilistic reasoning, not making definitive judgments about people based on their fields of study.
