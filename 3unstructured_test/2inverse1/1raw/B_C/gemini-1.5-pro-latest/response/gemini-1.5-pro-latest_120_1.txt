Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Curiosity, Puzzle Solving, Abstract Thinking:** These traits are strongly associated with computer science.  While someone in business administration might need these skills, they are more central to the core of computer science.
* **Love for Animals and Nature:** This doesn't directly correlate to either field.  There could be animal lovers in both business and computer science.
* **Warm Heart, Empathy:**  These traits are less typical stereotypes of computer science students, but again, there is a wide range within any field.

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are based on very limited information and rely on common stereotypes.  It's crucial to avoid making assumptions about individuals based solely on their field of study.
