Here's an estimated probability breakdown, keeping in mind this is based on stereotypes and the personality sketch alone:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," and "good at understanding abstract concepts" align strongly with common perceptions of computer science students.  
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and hard work are valued in business, the personality sketch emphasizes nature, empathy, and a quiet demeanor, which are less stereotypically associated with business administration. 

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are highly speculative.  Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of a person's field of study. Many individuals in computer science may not fit this description, and many in business administration might.
