Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned like "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," and "good at understanding abstract concepts" strongly align with the skills and interests often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While "understanding hard work and dedication" is relevant to business, the other traits are less specific to this field.  The sketch doesn't highlight typical business interests like leadership, finance, or marketing. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective assessment based on stereotypes.  People's personalities and career choices are complex. There are certainly individuals passionate about nature and animals who excel in business, and vice versa.
