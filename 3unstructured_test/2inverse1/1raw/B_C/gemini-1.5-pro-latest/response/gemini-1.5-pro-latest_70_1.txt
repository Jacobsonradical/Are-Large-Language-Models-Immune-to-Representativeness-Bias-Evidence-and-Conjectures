Here's an estimated probability based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The traits mentioned (enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) strongly align with skills and interests often found in computer science students. 
* **Business Administration:** While some aspects of the personality (hard work, dedication) are relevant to business, the sketch lacks clear indicators of a strong interest in business-related fields like finance, marketing, or management.  

**Important Note:** These are just estimates based on a brief personality sketch. Individual personalities and interests within any field are diverse. Many individuals in business administration might share traits described, and many computer science students might not.
