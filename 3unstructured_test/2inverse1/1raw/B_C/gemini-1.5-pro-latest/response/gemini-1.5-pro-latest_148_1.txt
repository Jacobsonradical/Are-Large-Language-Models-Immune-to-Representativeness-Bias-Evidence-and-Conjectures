Here's a breakdown of how the personality sketch might relate to the given fields, and my estimated probabilities:

**Analysis:**

* **Curiosity about nature & love for animals:**  While not directly related to computer science or business administration, these traits are more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine.  
* **Quiet, enjoys puzzles, good with abstract concepts:** This strongly suggests an aptitude for analytical and problem-solving fields, making computer science a more likely fit.
* **Warm heart, strong empathy:** These traits are valuable in many fields, including business administration (particularly areas like HR or socially responsible business practices). However, they are not as uniquely suggestive as the analytical traits mentioned above.
* **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication:** This is a general positive trait applicable to many fields.

**Probabilities:**

Considering these factors, here's my assessment:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The personality sketch strongly hints at a mind drawn to logic and problem-solving, making computer science more likely. While the empathy traits could fit with business administration, they aren't as uniquely suggestive, and the overall profile leans more towards a technical/analytical field.
