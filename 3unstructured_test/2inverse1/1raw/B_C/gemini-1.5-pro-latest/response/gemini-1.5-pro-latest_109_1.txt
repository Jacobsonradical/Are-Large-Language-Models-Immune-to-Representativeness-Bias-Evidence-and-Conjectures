Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The sketch emphasizes problem-solving skills, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence. These traits are strongly associated with computer science, making it a more likely field for Adam. 
* **Business Administration:** While intelligence and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators of traits typically associated with business administration, such as leadership, risk-taking, or a strong interest in economics/finance.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise.  Personality sketches offer limited information, and many individuals in business administration might share the traits described.  Similarly, plenty of people in computer science don't fit this description.
