Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description of Adam aligns well with traits often found in computer science students:
    * **Problem-solving:**  "Enjoys solving puzzles" is a strong indicator.
    * **Abstract Thinking:** "Good at understanding abstract concepts" is essential for programming and computer science theory.
    * **Curiosity:**  While not exclusive to computer science, curiosity is a driving force in many technical fields. 

* **Business Administration:** The sketch offers less direct correlation to business administration. While "hard work and dedication" are valuable in business, the other traits are less specifically aligned.  

**Important Note:**  These probabilities are subjective and based on general stereotypes. There's a wide range of personalities within any field.
