Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Computer Science:** The description heavily leans towards traits often associated with individuals drawn to computer science:
    * **Puzzle solving:**  A core element of programming and algorithmic thinking.
    * **Abstract concepts:**  Computer science often deals with abstract models and data structures. 
    * **High intelligence:**  Generally beneficial in the field.

* **Business Administration:** While intelligence, hard work, and empathy are valuable in business, the sketch lacks strong indicators typically associated with business interests:
    * **Leadership:** No mention of leadership qualities or desire to manage others.
    * **Financial acumen:** No mention of interest in finance, economics, or market dynamics.
    * **Competitiveness:**  The sketch doesn't suggest a particularly competitive nature.

**Important Note:**  This is a highly subjective assessment based on stereotypes.  Many individuals in business administration may share the traits described, and many computer science students may not.
