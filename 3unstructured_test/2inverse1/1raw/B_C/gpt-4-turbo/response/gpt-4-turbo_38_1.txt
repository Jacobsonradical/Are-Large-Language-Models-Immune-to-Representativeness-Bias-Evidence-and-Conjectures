Given the personality sketch and its focus on curiosity about nature, problem-solving, and affinity for abstract concepts, here is the estimation of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, considering his field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

In this estimation:
- Computer science often requires high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and the ability to understand abstract concepts, making it more likely that Adam studying computer science would match the described personality traits.
- Business administration requires some degree of problem solving and understanding complex concepts but is less directly connected to a deep curiosity about nature and plants, making it less likely relative to computer science.
