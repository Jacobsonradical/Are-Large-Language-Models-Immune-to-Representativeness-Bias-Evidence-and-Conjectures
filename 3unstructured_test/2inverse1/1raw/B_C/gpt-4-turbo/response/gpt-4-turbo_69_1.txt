Based on the personality sketch provided and considering the typical interests and skills associated with various academic fields, here is an estimation:

- The personality sketch describes someone who has an affinity for nature, puzzles, and animals, and exhibits high levels of empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These qualities suggest a strong tendency towards fields that involve analytical thinking, problem-solving, and potentially, a focus on the environment or biological sciences due to the interest in nature and animals. This inclines less towards typical business administration traits, which often emphasize leadership skills, strategic thinking, and operational management, although the managerial and ethical aspects could resonate with the commitment to hard work.

- Computer Science, on the other hand, fits more closely with the strengths in intelligence and especially in solving puzzles, which correlates well with programming and system design. The analytical skills and abstract thinking mentioned in the personality sketch align closely with computer science activities. Although the field may not directly cater to a love for nature and animals, the intellectual stimulation and problem-solving aspects of computer science could be attractive to someone with these characteristics.

Thus, the probabilities are estimated as follows, keeping in mind this is a subjective assessment based on typical field characteristics and described personality traits:
