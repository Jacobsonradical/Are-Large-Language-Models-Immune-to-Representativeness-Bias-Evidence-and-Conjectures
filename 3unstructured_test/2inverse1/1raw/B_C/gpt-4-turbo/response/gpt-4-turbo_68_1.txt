Based on the details provided in the personality sketch, we can analyze how well Adam's characteristics align with typical traits or interests associated with certain academic fields. The sketch reveals an individual who is curious about nature and plants, enjoys puzzles, and has strong empathy and love for animals. These traits can help us evaluate the likelihood that Adam was studying computer science or business administration.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - What aligns: Students in computer science often engage with puzzles (such as coding challenges and algorithm problems) and require high intelligence to understand abstract concepts, which matches the personality sketch.
   - What differs: There is no direct mention of technology or computer-specific interests. Also, the strong focus on nature, plants, and animals is not typically related to the core curriculum of computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - What aligns: Business administration requires understanding complex concepts and often appreciates individuals with strong empathy (useful in management and customer relations) and dedication.
   - What differs: The specific interests in nature, plants, and animals, as well as the focus on puzzles, are less aligned with typical business administration studies, which often focus more on economic models, organizational behavior, and financial aspects rather than naturalistic pursuits.

In terms of estimating the probability based on the personality sketch, the following assessments seem reasonable:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

These values reflect that while there are some overlaps in traits for both fields, neither closely aligns directly with the specific and more dominant interests in nature and animals noted in the personality sketch, leading to relatively low probabilities for both fields.
