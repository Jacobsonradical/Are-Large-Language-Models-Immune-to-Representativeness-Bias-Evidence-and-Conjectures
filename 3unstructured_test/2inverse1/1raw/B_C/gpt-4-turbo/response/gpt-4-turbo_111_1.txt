To determine the likelihood that the personality sketch describes Adam based on his field of study, we should consider how the described traits align with typical attributes or skills relevant to each field.

1. **Computer Science**: The sketch mentions a high intelligence and an affinity for solving puzzles, which are common traits among individuals in computer science due to the problem-solving nature of the field. The understanding of abstract concepts is also crucial for computer science. However, the strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature are not traits directly linked to the field.

2. **Business Administration**: While empathy can be a valuable skill in business for understanding and managing people, and being warm-hearted can help in leadership roles, the specific interests in nature, plants, and puzzles are less typically aligned with business administration, which often focuses more on operational, financial, and managerial competencies.

Based on this analysis, here's the subjective probability estimation for each field:
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
