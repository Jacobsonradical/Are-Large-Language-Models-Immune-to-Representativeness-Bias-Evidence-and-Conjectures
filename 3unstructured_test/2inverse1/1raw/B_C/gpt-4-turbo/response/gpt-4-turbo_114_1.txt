Given the personality sketch and the information about Adam, we can predict how likely it is that he studied computer science or business administration. Let's analyze how the traits line up with typical characteristics in these fields:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment in solving puzzles align well with computer science, which often involves abstract thinking and problem-solving.
   - Curiosity about nature and plants is less directly related to this field, though the thinking style can complement the required analytical skills in computer science.
   - Empathy and love for animals aren't directly related but might indicate a higher capacity for teamwork and concern for user experience in technology design.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication is a valuable trait in business administration.
   - However, strong empathy and a deep love for animals, as well as a curiosity about plants, are less obviously connected to the typical skills and interests in this field.
   - Business administration generally benefits from strong interpersonal skills and strategic thinking rather than puzzle-solving or abstract concepts.

Based on these considerations, the estimates might look as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

These values reflect the strength of the alignment between the personality traits provided and typical skill sets and interests in each field. Computer science seems more likely given the abstract thinking and problem-solving skills, whereas business administration, although plausible, seems less directly aligned with the described personality traits.
