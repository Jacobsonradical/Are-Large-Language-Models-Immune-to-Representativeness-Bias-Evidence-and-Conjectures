Based on the personality sketch provided and the typical characteristics associated with students in various fields, we can consider how well the personality traits might align with typical traits of students in computer science and business administration:

1. Computer Science: Students in computer science often exhibit high intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts, which matches the personality sketch. The interest in solving puzzles is also quite common in computer science due to the nature of programming and system design. However, the strong empathy and deep love for animals might not be directly relevant to the curriculum but could indicate a more well-rounded individual. Hence, the match isn't perfect but reasonable.

2. Business Administration: Students in this field are often characterized by their strong understanding of and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which aligns with the sketch. However, business administration programs typically focus less on abstract concepts and more on practical, managerial, and financial skills. While empathy is a valuable trait in leadership roles often essential in business, other traits such as curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals are less directly relevant to the typical coursework and career paths in business administration.

Given these considerations, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
} 

These values reflect the relative alignment of the personality traits with what might be expected or beneficial in each field of study.
