To estimate the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam for each academic field, we need to consider how the traits in the sketch align with characteristics typical of students in those fields. 

The sketch describes someone with qualities like curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and the ability to understand abstract concepts. It specifically mentions a warm-hearted nature that takes an interest in solving puzzles and appreciates hard work and dedication.

**Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals who are good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, as these skills are integral to programming and systems design. However, the strong interest in nature and animals is less directly connected to typical computer science activities or studies. Nonetheless, personality diversity in this field still allows for such interests.

**Business Administration**: Students in business administration are often driven by strategic thinking and practical application in the business world. While empathy can be beneficial in leadership roles and appreciating hard work is crucial in business success, a distinct interest in nature and animals is not typically linked with the core pursuits of a business administration curriculum. This field tends to focus more on human systems, finance, and management, rather than the natural world.

Based on this analysis, assuming no other personality information about Adam or the proportion of types within each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

These values reflect estimations based on how well the personality traits align with the general interests and skills associated with students in computer science and business administration, respectively. The higher value in computer science is given due to the match in problem-solving skills and appreciation for abstract concepts, despite the less typical alignment with nature and animal interests.
