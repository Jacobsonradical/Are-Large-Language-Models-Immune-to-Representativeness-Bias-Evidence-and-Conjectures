Based on the given personality sketch, I will provide my best estimate of the probability that the sketch describes Adam, dependent on his field of study. Here's my assessment:

- **Computer Science**: This field requires high intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts, both attributes noted in the personality sketch. The interest in solving puzzles aligns well with computer science, which often involves problem-solving skills. However, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals is not typically central to computer science studies.

- **Business Administration**: This field values hard work and dedication, traits mentioned in the sketch. However, the emphasis on empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature and plants seems less directly relevant to typical business administration curricula, which focuses more on management, economics, leadership, and organizational skills.

I will provide numeric probabilities taking into consideration the fit between the personality traits described and the typical focus areas of the relevant academic fields.
