Based on the personality sketch provided, we can analyze the likelihood that Adam, with the described attributes, might be enrolled in either computer science or business administration.

Computer science students often require high intelligence to understand complex and abstract concepts and techniques, including algorithms and data structures. Furthermore, problem-solving is a key aspect of computer science, aligning well with the description of the subject as someone who enjoys solving puzzles. However, the strong emphasis on the subject's deep love for nature and animals is not typically associated with computer science studies.

Business administration, on the other hand, involves understanding organizational behavior, management skills, and often requires strong interpersonal skills and empathy, to some extent in handling human resource or client relationship situations. However, the connection to solving puzzles and the high interest in abstract concepts might be less pertinent here than in computer science; however, appreciation for hard work and dedication is quite relevant in business studies.

Given these considerations, here are the probabilities:
- Computer science might be chosen due to the abstract thinking, high intelligence, and problem-solving fit. However, the emphasis on nature may slightly dampen this probability.
- Business administration might be less likely given the personality sketch emphasizes traits that align less directly with typical business studies, focusing more on interpersonal and management skills.
