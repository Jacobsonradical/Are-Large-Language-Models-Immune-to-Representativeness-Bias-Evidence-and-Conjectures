Based on the personality sketch provided and the typical interests and skills associated with different academic disciplines, here are the estimates:

For computer science:
- The personality traits such as high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles are quite congruent with what one might expect from a student in computer science. These skills align well with problem-solving and conceptual thinking required in the field. However, the deep love for animals and plants might be more coincidental and not directly related to the field.

For business administration:
- While high intelligence is certainly beneficial in business administration, the specific interests and passions described in the sketch, such as a deep love for animals and plants, as well as being a quiet person who enjoys puzzles, do not align as strongly with typical business administration pursuits. These pursuits often focus more on leadership, interpersonal skills, and an interest in market dynamics, economics, or operational strategies.

Thus, the estimated probabilities might be as follows:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
