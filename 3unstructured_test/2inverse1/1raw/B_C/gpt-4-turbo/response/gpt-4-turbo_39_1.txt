Based on the personality sketch and considering Adam's potential field of study, here are the estimates:

1. Business Administration:
- This field generally focuses on management, finance, marketing, and human resources. While empathy and understanding could be beneficial, the characteristics of curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and enjoyment of puzzles aren't typically aligned with the core interests and activities prominent in business administration. Hence, the alignment seems somewhat lower.

2. Computer Science:
- This field involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and often requires a deep appreciation for complex systems which can align closely with a personality that enjoys puzzles and has a high intelligence. The curiosity about nature, plants, and animals might also intersect with interests in fields like bioinformatics within computer science, enhancing the probability.

Here is the probability estimate formatted as requested:

{
  "business administration": "0.15",
  "computer science": "0.65"
