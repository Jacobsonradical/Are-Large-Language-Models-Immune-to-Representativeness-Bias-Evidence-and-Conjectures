Given the personality traits described in the sketch and the typical attributes associated with specific academic fields, here is the assessment:

- A student with a deep curiosity about nature and plants could perhaps have interests aligning with scientific research, particularly in fields like biology or environmental science, more than in computer science or business administration. However, the enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence could correlate somewhat with the analytical and problem-solving aspects of computer science.

- The mention of a warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals doesnâ€™t directly correlate with the core skills or interests commonly associated with computer science or business administration. These traits might be more directly applicable to fields like veterinary science, psychology, or social work.

- The appreciation for hard work and dedication is a generic positive trait that would be beneficial in any field, including both computer science and business administration.

Based on these considerations, probabilities for Adam studying in these fields can be estimated as:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",  // Given the match with problem-solving and interest in abstract concepts but less alignment with his love for nature and empathy.
  "business administration": "0.2"  // Some aspects of administration may require abstract thinking and appreciation of hard work, but the fit is less direct compared to computer science.
