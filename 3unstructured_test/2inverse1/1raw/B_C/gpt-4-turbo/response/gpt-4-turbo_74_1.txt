Based on the personality sketch, Adam is described as having a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, and has a deep love for animals. He is also noted for his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts. These personality traits can inform us about the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in particular fields of study.

For business administration and computer science:
- Business administration typically focuses more on management, financial operations, and organizational skills. While Adam's described traits like empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature don't directly align with typical business administration pursuits, his strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant. However, the link is somewhat weak.
- Computer science often involves problem-solving, understanding of abstract concepts, and sometimes involves projects related to nature and scientific datasets, which might capture Adam's interest. His enjoyment in solving puzzles and handling complex, abstract ideas aligns well with computer science.

Given this analysis, here are the probability estimates:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
