Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of genuine curiosity, enjoying puzzle solving, high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts align well with someone likely to study computer science. The empathy, warm heart and love of animals are less directly relevant to computer science.

Business administration relies more on interpersonal skills, leadership, and practical application rather than abstract reasoning and puzzle solving. The personality traits given seem less indicative of someone likely to study business, though the dedication and hard work could apply.

Of course, individuals can have diverse interests and personalities that lead them to many different fields. But based solely on the brief sketch provided, I estimate a higher probability of the subject studying computer science compared to business administration.
