Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. This fits well with a computer science student. The curiosity about nature and love of animals is less directly relevant but could still fit.

Business administration is certainly possible given the strong work ethic and dedication mentioned. However, the other traits around abstract thinking, curiosity about nature, and empathy for animals seem to fit less well with a typical business student profile compared to computer science.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information and stereotypes. The sketch could potentially match a motivated student in a variety of fields. But based on the details provided, I'd estimate a higher probability of around 70% that Adam studied computer science compared to around 30% for business administration.
