Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract problem solving. While these traits could apply to many fields, I think they align somewhat more with computer science than business administration. The curiosity, intelligence, and inclination towards puzzles and abstractions seem to fit the profile of many computer science students and professionals. Business administration also requires intelligence of course, but tends to be more people and process-oriented rather than as focused on abstract concepts and problem solving. The empathy and dedication could apply to both fields.

So while the personality could plausibly match someone in either field, I estimate a somewhat higher probability of around 60% that Adam studied computer science, and a lower but still reasonable 30% chance he studied business administration, based on the limited information provided. More details about Adam's specific interests and strengths would help refine the estimate further.
