Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align more closely with someone likely to pursue graduate studies in computer science compared to business administration. However, qualities like empathy, a warm heart, and strong work ethic could apply to dedicated students in either field. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of 0.7 that this describes a computer science grad student like Adam, and a lower but non-zero probability of 0.3 that it could describe a business administration student.
