Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving. This aligns more closely with typical traits and interests of someone studying computer science compared to business administration. However, the sketch also mentions empathy, dedication and hard work which could apply to either field. Without more specific information, computer science seems more probable based on the description, but both are certainly possible.
