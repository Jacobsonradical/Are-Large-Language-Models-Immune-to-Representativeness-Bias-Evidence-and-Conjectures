Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence and understanding abstract concepts align well with a computer science student. The empathy, warm heart and love of animals are less directly related but not incompatible.

For a business administration student, traits like hard work, dedication and intelligence are relevant, but the other traits mentioned like curiosity about nature, love of animals, and puzzle-solving seem less aligned with typical business students, so I assigned a lower probability for that field based on the sketch provided.
