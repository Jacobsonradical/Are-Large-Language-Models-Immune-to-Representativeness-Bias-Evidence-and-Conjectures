Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem to align well with a computer science student. The empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to many fields. Without more specific information tying the traits to business, I would estimate a lower probability of the sketch referring to a business administration student compared to computer science. However, these are just rough estimates based on limited information.
