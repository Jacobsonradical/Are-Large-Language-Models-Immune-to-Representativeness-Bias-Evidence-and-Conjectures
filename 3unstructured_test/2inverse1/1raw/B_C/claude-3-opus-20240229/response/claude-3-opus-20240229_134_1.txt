Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence and abstract thinking align well with a computer science field. The empathy, warm heart and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with either field, but seem slightly more aligned with computer science over business administration in my estimation. However, both fields are certainly possible based on the limited information provided.
