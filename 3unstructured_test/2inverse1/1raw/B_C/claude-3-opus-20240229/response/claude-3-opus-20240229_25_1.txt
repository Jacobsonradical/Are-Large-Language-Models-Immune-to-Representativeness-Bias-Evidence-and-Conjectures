Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his enrollment in each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy and a love for animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying computer science compared to business administration.

Computer science often attracts people who enjoy problem-solving, are analytically minded, and can grasp abstract concepts well. The curiosity about nature could also tie into an interest in the natural sciences that sometimes goes along with computer science.

While business administration requires intelligence, hard work and dedication too, the other traits around curiosity, puzzles, empathy and animals don't seem as strongly associated with typical business students, in my estimation. Business tends to attract more extroverted, people-oriented individuals as well.

So while it's certainly possible Adam with this personality could be in either field, I believe the sketch is more probable for a computer science student, with a 70% chance versus only 40% for business administration. But there is some uncertainty around the estimates given the limited information provided.
