Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his enrollment in each field of graduate study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong curiosity about nature, aptitude for abstract thinking and problem solving, and deep empathy. While these traits could apply to someone in business administration, they seem to more closely align with someone in a technical and scientific field like computer science. The affinity for abstract concepts, puzzle solving, and dedication fit well with the typical strengths and interests of someone pursuing graduate studies in computer science. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to assign a high probability to either field with great confidence.
