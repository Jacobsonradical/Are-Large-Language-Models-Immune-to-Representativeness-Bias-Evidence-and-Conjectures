Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, and highly intelligent. These traits seem more aligned with a field like computer science than business administration. The empathy, love of animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication could apply to either field. But overall, the profile seems to fit better with a graduate student in a technical, scientific field like computer science rather than the more people-oriented, applied domain of business administration. Of course, there are many exceptions and an individual with those traits could certainly pursue either path. This is just my best estimate based on the limited information provided.
