Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his enrollment in each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving. This aligns well with typical traits of computer science students. While business students can certainly have these qualities too, they seem somewhat more common and pronounced in computer science.

The strong empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with either field. Business students need dedication and work ethic to succeed. Empathy is a valuable trait for leadership and management.

So while the personality sketch could potentially describe a student in either field, the specific traits around abstract thinking and problem solving make me estimate a higher probability that Adam was a computer science student compared to business. But both are certainly plausible based on the description.
