Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on the two fields of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. However, empathy, dedication and hard work are valuable in both fields, so I wouldn't completely rule out business administration.
