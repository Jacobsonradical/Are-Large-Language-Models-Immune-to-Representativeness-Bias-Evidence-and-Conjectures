Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts seem to align more closely with a computer science field. While business administration requires hard work and dedication which the subject appreciates, overall the personality traits seem to fit better with computer science. However, there is still a reasonable probability the subject could be in business administration.
