Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each of the given fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying computer science than business administration. However, the sketch also mentions a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could apply to both fields. Overall, I estimate a higher probability that Adam was studying computer science based on the given personality description.
