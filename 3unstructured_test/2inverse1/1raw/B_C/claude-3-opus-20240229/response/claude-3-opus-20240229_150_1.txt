Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with someone likely to study computer science rather than business administration. However, the traits of empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication could apply to both fields to some degree.
