Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align more closely with computer science than business administration. Problem-solving skills, curiosity, and the ability to grasp abstract concepts are important in computer science. Business administration tends to be more people and process-oriented.

However, the sketch could potentially fit either field to some degree. Dedication and hard work are valued in business as well. And business does require analytical and problem-solving skills, even if less abstract than computer science. So while I assess a higher probability of computer science, I wouldn't rule out business administration entirely based on the limited information provided.
