Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with the field of computer science. The empathy, warm heart, and love of animals are less directly relevant but could still fit with someone in that field.

Business administration is certainly possible given the strong work ethic and dedication mentioned. However, the other traits around curiosity, abstract thinking, puzzles and nature seem less directly applicable to business compared to computer science.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information in the personality sketch. Many other fields are also possible and individuals can certainly have diverse interests and traits that don't necessarily align with their chosen area of study. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate or clarify my reasoning further.
