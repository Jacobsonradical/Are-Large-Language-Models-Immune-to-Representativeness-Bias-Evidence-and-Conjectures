Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, which aligns well with typical traits of computer science students. The empathy, love of animals and nature could apply to many fields. Business administration is certainly possible but the overall profile seems to fit computer science a bit better based on the details provided. Of course, these are just rough estimates given the limited information.
