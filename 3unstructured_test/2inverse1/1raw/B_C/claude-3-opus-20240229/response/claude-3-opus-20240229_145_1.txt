Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with someone studying computer science rather than business administration. However, the empathy, warm heart and dedication could apply to either field. So while I think computer science is more likely given the personality description, I wouldn't rule out business administration entirely.
