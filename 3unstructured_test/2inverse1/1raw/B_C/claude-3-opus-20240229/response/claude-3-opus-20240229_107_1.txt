Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on the two fields of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles seem to align well with someone studying computer science. The empathy, warm heart, and love of animals are less directly related but certainly compatible.

For business administration, traits like hard work, dedication and intelligence are quite relevant. However, the overall profile seems somewhat less aligned with typical business students compared to computer science students, in my estimation. The mentions of curiosity about nature/plants, empathy, and love of animals seem less common for business majors.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on general tendencies, and individuals in any field can have a wide range of personality traits. The probabilities are not definitive.
