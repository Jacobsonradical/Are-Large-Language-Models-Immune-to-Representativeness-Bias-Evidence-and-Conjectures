Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch mentions qualities like curiosity, puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, which seem more aligned with computer science. Business administration is certainly possible, but the overall profile seems to fit computer science a bit better in my estimation, based on the limited information provided. Of course, these are just rough estimates with considerable uncertainty.
