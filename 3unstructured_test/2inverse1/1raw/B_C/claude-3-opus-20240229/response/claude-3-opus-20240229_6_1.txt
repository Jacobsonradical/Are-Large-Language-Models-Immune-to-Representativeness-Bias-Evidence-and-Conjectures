Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming he was enrolled in that field in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align more closely with a computer science student profile. While business students can certainly have those traits too, empathy for animals and a love of nature are a bit less typical for that field, in my estimation. Of course, any individual can have a wide mix of interests and traits. But based solely on the brief description provided, I'd assign a higher probability to computer science than business administration.
