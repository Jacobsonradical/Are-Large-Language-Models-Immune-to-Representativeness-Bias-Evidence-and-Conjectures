Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an ability to understand abstract concepts. This aligns more closely with someone studying computer science rather than business administration. Computer science often involves problem-solving and working with abstract logical concepts. 

However, the sketch also mentions an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could apply to business administration as well. And of course, individuals can have a wide range of interests beyond their field of study.

So while I believe the personality is more likely to be a computer science student, I wouldn't rule out business administration entirely based on this brief sketch. The probabilities I've assigned reflect my level of confidence but are ultimately subjective estimates given the limited information provided.
