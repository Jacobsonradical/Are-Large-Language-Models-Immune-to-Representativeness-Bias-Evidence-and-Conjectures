Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying computer science rather than business administration. Computer science requires strong analytical and problem-solving skills to understand and develop complex systems. The curiosity about nature and abstract concepts also fits well with computer science.

Business administration is more focused on management, finance, and operations. While intelligence and dedication are important, the other traits mentioned like empathy for animals and curiosity about plants seem less directly relevant. Some aspects like problem-solving could apply to both fields.

Of course, there is individual variation and these traits don't determine what someone studies. But based on the overall profile, I estimate a 70% chance of computer science and a 30% chance of business administration. The probabilities don't need to add to 1 since there are many other fields Adam could potentially be studying as well.
