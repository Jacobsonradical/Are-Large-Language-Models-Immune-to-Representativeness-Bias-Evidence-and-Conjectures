Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, puzzles, abstract concepts, and animals. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, they align more closely with computer science than business administration. Computer science often involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and an appreciation for complex systems, which seem to fit the sketch well. Business administration is more focused on management, finance, and leadership skills. So while it's certainly possible Adam studied business, I think the details in the personality sketch make computer science the more likely field, based on the limited information provided.
