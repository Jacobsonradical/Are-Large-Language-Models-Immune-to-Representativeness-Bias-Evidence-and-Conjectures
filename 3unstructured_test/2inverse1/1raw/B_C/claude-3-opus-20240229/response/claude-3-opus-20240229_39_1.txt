Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence and understanding abstract concepts align well with someone who would pursue graduate studies in computer science.

While some of the traits like hard work, dedication and intelligence could also apply to business administration, the overall profile seems to fit computer science a bit better in my estimation. The strong empathy, love of nature and animals seems less directly relevant to typical business administration studies.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information and stereotypical associations. The personality sketch provides a general profile but there are certainly people with those traits across many different academic disciplines.
