Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, given his enrollment in each respective field:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles seem to align well with a computer science student. The empathy, warm heart, and love of animals are less directly relevant but could certainly apply to a computer science student as well.

For business administration, traits like hard work, dedication, and intelligence are quite relevant. However, the emphasis on curiosity about nature, love of animals, and abstract thinking seem less directly applicable, though certainly possible.

Of course, these are just estimates based on general associations between personality traits and fields of study. Any individual can have a wide variety of interests and traits that may not match stereotypes of their chosen field.
