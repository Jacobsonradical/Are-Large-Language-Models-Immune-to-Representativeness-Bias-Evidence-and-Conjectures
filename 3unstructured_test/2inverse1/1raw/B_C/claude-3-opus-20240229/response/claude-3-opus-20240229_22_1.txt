Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy and a love for animals, and can understand abstract concepts well. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying computer science compared to business administration.

However, the sketch also mentions an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could apply to both fields. Business administration cannot be ruled out entirely based on the personality description.

So while computer science seems a more likely fit given the personality traits emphasized, business administration is also a possibility. The probabilities reflect this assessment, with a higher but not certain probability assigned to computer science.
