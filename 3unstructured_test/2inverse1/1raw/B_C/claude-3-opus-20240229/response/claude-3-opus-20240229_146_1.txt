Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy. These traits seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. Problem-solving, dealing with abstractions, and a deep interest in understanding how things work are often associated with computer science and related technical fields. Business administration tends to be more people and process-oriented.

However, the sketch also mentions appreciating hard work and dedication, which could apply to both fields. And of course, there is individual variation - these are broad generalizations. Without more specific information, it's impossible to say definitively. But based on the overall profile, I estimate a higher probability of about 70% that Adam studies computer science, versus around 30% for business administration.
