Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on his graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature and abstract concepts, empathetic, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to many fields, they align quite well with someone studying computer science, which involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and dedication. Business administration is also a possibility given the mention of understanding hard work, but overall the sketch seems to fit computer science a bit better in my estimation. Of course, this is just a rough probabilistic guess based on limited information.
