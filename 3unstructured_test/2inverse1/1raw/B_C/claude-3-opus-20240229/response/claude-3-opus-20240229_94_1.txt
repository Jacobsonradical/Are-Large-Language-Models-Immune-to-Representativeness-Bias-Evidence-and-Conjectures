Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with a computer science background. The empathy, warm heart and love for nature and animals could fit with many fields. Business administration is certainly possible but the overall profile seems to lean more towards an analytical, abstract and technical field like computer science. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information about the individual.
