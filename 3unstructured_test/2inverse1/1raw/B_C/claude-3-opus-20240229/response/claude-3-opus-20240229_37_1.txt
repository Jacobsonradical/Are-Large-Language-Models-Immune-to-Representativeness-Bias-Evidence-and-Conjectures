Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy and a love for animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to students in various fields, they seem to align more closely with someone in a scientific or technical field like computer science, rather than business administration. The subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also suggests a stronger fit with computer science. However, without more specific information, there is still a reasonable probability that Adam could be studying business administration.
