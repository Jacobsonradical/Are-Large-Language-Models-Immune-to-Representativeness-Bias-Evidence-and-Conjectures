Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving, and has strong empathy. These traits align more closely with someone likely to pursue computer science rather than business administration. The curiosity, problem-solving skills, and ability to grasp abstract concepts are especially indicative of an aptitude for computer science. However, the dedication and hard work mentioned could apply to either field. Overall, I estimate a higher probability that this personality describes a computer science graduate student compared to a business administration student, but both are plausible to some degree based on the information provided.
