Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. However, empathy, appreciation for hard work, and dedication could apply to both fields. So while I think computer science is more likely given the personality description, business administration also seems quite possible for Adam.
