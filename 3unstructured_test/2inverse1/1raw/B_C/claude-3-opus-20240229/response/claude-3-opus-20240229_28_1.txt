Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with a computer science student. The empathy, warm heart, and love of animals are less directly relevant but not incompatible.

For a business administration student, the traits of hard work, dedication, and intelligence are relevant. However, the emphasis on curiosity about nature, love of animals, and abstract thinking seem less aligned with a typical business student.

Of course, these are generalizations and any individual can have a wide range of interests and personality traits. But based on the sketch, I'd estimate a higher likelihood of the subject being a computer science vs business administration grad student.
