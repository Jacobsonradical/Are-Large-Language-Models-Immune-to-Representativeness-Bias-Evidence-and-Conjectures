Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone with strong analytical and problem-solving skills who enjoys abstract concepts, which aligns well with a computer science background. The curiosity about nature and love of animals is less directly relevant but not incompatible.

For business administration, the dedication and hard work are relevant traits, but overall the profile seems somewhat less aligned with typical business pursuits. The empathy and love of animals don't strongly suggest a business focus.

These are just rough estimates based on limited information. The probabilities don't need to add to 1 since they are for two separate scenarios, not an either/or situation. Let me know if you would like me to explain my reasoning further.
