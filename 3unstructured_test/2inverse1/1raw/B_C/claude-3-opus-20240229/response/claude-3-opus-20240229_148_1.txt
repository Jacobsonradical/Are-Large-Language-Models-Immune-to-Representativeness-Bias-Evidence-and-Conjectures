Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each of the specified fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious, analytical, empathetic, and appreciates hard work and abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align more closely with computer science than business administration. The curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence and ease with abstract concepts all point more towards an analytical field like computer science. Business administration tends to be more people and process-oriented.

However, the strong empathy, warm heart and dedication are qualities that could certainly be an asset in business as well. So while I believe computer science is more likely given the full personality profile, I wouldn't rule out business administration entirely based on this sketch alone. The probabilities I provided reflect that computer science seems more probable, but both are plausible to some degree without more specific information about Adam's interests and skills.
