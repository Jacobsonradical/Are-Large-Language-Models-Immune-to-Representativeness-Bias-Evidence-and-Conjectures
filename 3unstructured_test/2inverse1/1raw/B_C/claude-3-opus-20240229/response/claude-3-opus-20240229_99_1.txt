Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with someone studying computer science compared to business administration. However, qualities like empathy, a warm heart, and appreciating hard work and dedication could apply to either field. Overall, I estimate a higher probability that this describes a computer science graduate student, but it's certainly possible it could describe a business administration student as well.
