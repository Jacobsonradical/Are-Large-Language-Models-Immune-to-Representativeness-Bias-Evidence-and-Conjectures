Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious, intelligent, empathetic, and appreciates hard work and abstract concepts. While these qualities could apply to many fields, they seem to align more closely with computer science than business administration. The curiosity about nature and love of solving puzzles in particular seem to fit well with the analytical and problem-solving skills often found in computer science students and professionals. Business administration relies more on interpersonal, leadership and management skills that were not highlighted in the sketch. However, the limited information means significant uncertainty in the estimates.
