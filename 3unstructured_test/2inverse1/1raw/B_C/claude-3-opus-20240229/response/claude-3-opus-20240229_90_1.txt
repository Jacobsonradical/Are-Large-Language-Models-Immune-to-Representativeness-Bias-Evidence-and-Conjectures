Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving skills, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with a computer science student. The empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to many fields. Business administration is certainly possible but the overall profile seems to fit better with computer science in my estimation.
