Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, intelligent, and empathetic. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, I believe they align more strongly with someone in a STEM field like computer science compared to business administration. The analytical and problem-solving skills seem particularly relevant for computer science. However, Adam could potentially have these traits while studying business administration as well, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. This is my best estimate based on the limited information provided.
