Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each of the given fields:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, which align well with computer science. The empathy, love of nature and animals is less directly relevant but still compatible.

For business administration, dedication and hard work are certainly relevant traits. However, the overall profile seems to fit less strongly with typical business student traits and interests compared to computer science.

These are rough estimates based on limited information. The probabilities don't need to add to 1 since they are for each field independently rather than the probability across all possible fields.
