Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and abstract thinking align more strongly with computer science, while empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to both fields to some degree. However, the strong interest in nature, plants and animals seems less directly relevant to either field. These are rough estimates based on limited information.
