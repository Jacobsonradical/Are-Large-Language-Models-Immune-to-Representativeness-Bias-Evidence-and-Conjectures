Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts align well with a computer science background, so I estimate a relatively high 70% probability for that field.

Business administration is more people and organization focused. While traits like dedication and hard work are relevant, the other traits seem less directly applicable, so I estimate a lower 40% probability for business compared to computer science based on the personality description provided.
