Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious, intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to many fields, they align more closely with computer science than business administration. Computer science often involves abstract concepts, problem-solving, and logical thinking. Business administration tends to be more people and process-oriented. So while it's certainly possible Adam was studying business, I estimate a higher probability of around 0.7 that the personality description matches someone in computer science, and a lower 0.3 probability for business administration. But there isn't enough specific information to say definitively.
