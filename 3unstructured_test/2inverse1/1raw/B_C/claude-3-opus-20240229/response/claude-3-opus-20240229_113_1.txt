Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align more closely with computer science than business administration. Computer science often involves abstract problem solving and puzzle-like challenges that would appeal to the type of person described. However, the warm heart, empathy and dedication mentioned could also suit someone in business administration, so I wouldn't rule it out entirely. This is my best estimate based on the limited information provided.
