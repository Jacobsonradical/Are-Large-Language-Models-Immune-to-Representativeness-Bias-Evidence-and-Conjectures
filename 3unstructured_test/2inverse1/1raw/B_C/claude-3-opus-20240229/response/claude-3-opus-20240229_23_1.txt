Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and can understand abstract concepts well. These traits seem more aligned with a student pursuing computer science rather than business administration. The empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication could apply to both fields. However, the overall profile seems to fit a bit better with a computer science student, so I've assigned a higher probability to that field, while still allowing a reasonable chance that Adam could have been a business administration student.
