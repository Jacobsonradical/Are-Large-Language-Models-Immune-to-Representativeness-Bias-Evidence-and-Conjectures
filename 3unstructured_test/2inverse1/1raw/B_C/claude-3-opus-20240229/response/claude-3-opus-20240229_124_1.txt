Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, for each of the given fields of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality traits described, I think there is a higher probability that Adam was studying computer science compared to business administration. His curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with typical traits of computer science students and researchers. However, his warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also suit someone studying business administration, so I gave that a 30% probability as well. Of course, these are just rough estimates based on the limited information provided.
