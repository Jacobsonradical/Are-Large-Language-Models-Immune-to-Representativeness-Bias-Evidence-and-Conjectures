Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious about nature, enjoys problem-solving, has strong empathy, and appreciates hard work and abstract thinking. While these traits could apply to many fields, I believe they align more closely with computer science than business administration.

Computer science involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and often an appreciation for the dedication required to solve complex challenges. The subject's curiosity and intelligence also seem well-suited for computer science.

Business administration is certainly a possibility, as it requires hard work, problem-solving and abstract thinking as well. However, the emphasis on nature, animals, and puzzles seems to point a bit more towards the scientific mindset common in computer science.

Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information. The individual could certainly excel in either field or have interests entirely outside of these two areas. But based solely on the personality sketch, I believe computer science is more probable than business administration.
