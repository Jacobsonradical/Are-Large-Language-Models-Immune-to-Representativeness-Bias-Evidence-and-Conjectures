Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys problem-solving. This aligns well with typical traits of someone studying computer science.

While the strong work ethic and dedication mentioned could apply to business administration students, overall the profile seems to fit more with an analytical, abstract thinker like a computer science student, rather than the interpersonal and leadership skills often associated with business.

However, these are only rough estimations based on limited information and generalizations. The probabilities are not extremely high for either field.
