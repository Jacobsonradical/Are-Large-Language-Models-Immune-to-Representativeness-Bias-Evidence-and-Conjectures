Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy and a love for animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to people in many fields, I think they align more closely with someone studying computer science compared to business administration.

Computer science involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and dedication, which seem to fit the description well. The person's curiosity about nature and love of animals doesn't necessarily relate directly to CS, but it shows an inquisitive mind.

Business administration is more focused on management, finance, and operations. While the traits described could certainly apply to some business students, I don't think they are as strongly indicative of that field of study compared to CS. The description doesn't mention anything about leadership, communication, or other stereotypical business-related strengths.

Of course, this is just a rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypes. The probabilities are not extremely high for either field. The personality sketch provides a high-level description that could match students in a variety of disciplines. More specific details about the person's academic interests and strengths would allow for a more confident assessment.
