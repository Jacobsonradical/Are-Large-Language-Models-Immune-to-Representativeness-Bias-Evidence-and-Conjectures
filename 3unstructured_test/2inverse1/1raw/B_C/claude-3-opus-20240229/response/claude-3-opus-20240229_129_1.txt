Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was enrolled in that field in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's strong curiosity, intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and puzzle-solving interest suggest a higher probability of being in a field like computer science. Business administration is certainly possible given the subject's understanding of hard work and dedication, but the overall profile seems to align more closely with typical traits of someone in computer science or a related technical field. Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information.
