Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving. These traits seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. However, the sketch also mentions appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as empathy, which could be relevant in business fields as well. Overall though, I estimate a higher probability of the sketch being about a computer science student compared to a business administration student, based on the specific details provided.
