Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align more closely with someone likely to study computer science rather than business administration. However, the empathy, warm heart and dedication could fit with either field to some degree, so I assigned a non-zero probability to business administration as well.
