Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch mentions qualities like curiosity, solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, which seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. However, the strong work ethic and dedication could apply to both fields. Overall, I estimate a higher probability of around 0.7 that this describes a computer science student like Adam compared to around 0.3 for a business administration student.
