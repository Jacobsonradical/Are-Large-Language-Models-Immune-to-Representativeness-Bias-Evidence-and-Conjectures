Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's strong curiosity, intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts seem well-suited for computer science. Problem solving and dedication are also valuable traits in that field.

Business administration is certainly possible given the subject's intelligence and work ethic. However, the personality traits around curiosity, empathy, and love of nature and animals seem somewhat less directly relevant for typical business administration roles compared to computer science.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information and stereotypes. The personality sketch could potentially describe a graduate student in a variety of fields.
