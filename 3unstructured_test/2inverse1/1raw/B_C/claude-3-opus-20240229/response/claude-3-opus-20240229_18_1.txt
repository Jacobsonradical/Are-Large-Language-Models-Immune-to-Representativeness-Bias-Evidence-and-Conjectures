Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with high intelligence, an ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles. These traits align well with a computer science student. 

While business administration students can certainly also be intelligent and good at abstract thinking, the other details like curiosity about nature, love of animals, and strong empathy are less directly relevant to typical business studies. The personality sketch overall seems more probable for a computer science student than a business student, in my estimation.
