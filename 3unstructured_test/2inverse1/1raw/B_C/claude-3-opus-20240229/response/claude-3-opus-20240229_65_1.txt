Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, love of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a stronger fit with computer science compared to business administration. However, the subject's appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with either field to some degree.
