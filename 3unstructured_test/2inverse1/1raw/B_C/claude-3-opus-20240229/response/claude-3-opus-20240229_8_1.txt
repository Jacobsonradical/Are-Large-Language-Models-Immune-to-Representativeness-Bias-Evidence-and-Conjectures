Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with a computer science student than a business administration student. However, traits like empathy, having a warm heart, and appreciating hard work and dedication could apply to both fields. Overall, I estimate a higher probability that this sketch describes a computer science grad student compared to a business grad student, but it's certainly possible the person could be studying business.
