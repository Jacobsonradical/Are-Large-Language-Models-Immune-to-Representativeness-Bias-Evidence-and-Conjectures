Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is highly intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits align well with a computer science student. The curiosity about nature and love of animals is less directly relevant but not incompatible.

For a business administration student, the empathy, dedication and hard work are relevant traits. However, the overall profile seems to fit somewhat better with computer science than business, based on the emphasis on abstract thinking and puzzle-solving. Business requires interpersonal skills that aren't highlighted.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information and stereotypes about the fields. The probabilities are far from certain. Many additional details about Adam would be needed to truly gauge how well the personality sketch captures his individual traits and interests.
