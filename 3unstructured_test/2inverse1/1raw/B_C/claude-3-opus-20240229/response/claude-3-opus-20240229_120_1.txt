Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, seem more aligned with someone studying computer science rather than business administration. However, traits like empathy, a warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to both fields. Overall, I estimate a higher probability that Adam was studying computer science based on the personality sketch provided.
