Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with someone studying computer science compared to business administration. However, the empathy, warm-heartedness and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to either field. Overall, I estimate a higher probability of the sketch being about a computer science student like Adam, but it's certainly possible it could describe a business student as well.
