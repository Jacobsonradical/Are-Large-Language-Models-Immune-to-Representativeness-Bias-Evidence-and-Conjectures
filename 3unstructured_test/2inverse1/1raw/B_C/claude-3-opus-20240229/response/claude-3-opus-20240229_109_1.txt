Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, assuming Adam was a graduate student in that field in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, and being good at understanding abstract concepts seem to align well with someone studying computer science. The enjoyment of solving puzzles also fits this field.

For business administration, traits like dedication and hard work are relevant, but overall the personality sketch seems less directly applicable to typical business administration studies and careers compared to computer science. The strong interest in nature, plants and animals seems less common for business students.

These are just rough estimates based on the limited information provided. The probabilities don't need to add to 1 since they are for different hypothetical scenarios of Adam's field of study.
