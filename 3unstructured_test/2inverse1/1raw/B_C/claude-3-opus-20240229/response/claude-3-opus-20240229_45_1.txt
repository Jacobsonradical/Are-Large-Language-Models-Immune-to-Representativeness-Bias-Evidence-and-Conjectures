Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem to align well with a computer science field. The empathy, warm heart, and love of animals are less directly relevant but could still fit.

For business administration, the strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant. The other traits seem less directly applicable to business, although intelligence, abstract thinking and empathy can certainly be assets in that field as well.

So while both are plausible, the overall profile seems to lean more towards computer science in my estimation. But there is certainly some probability it could be either field based on the information provided.
