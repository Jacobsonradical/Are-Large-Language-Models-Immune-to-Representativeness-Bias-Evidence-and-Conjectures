Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his enrollment in each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature and enjoys abstract concepts and problem-solving. This aligns more closely with typical traits of someone in computer science compared to business administration. However, the empathy, warm heart and dedication could certainly apply to someone in business as well. Without more specific information, it's impossible to say definitively, but based on the limited information provided, I estimate a higher probability of the sketch describing a computer science student like Adam compared to a business student.
