Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his enrollment in each field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a curious, analytical mind who enjoys abstract concepts and problem-solving. They also have a deep appreciation for nature and animals. While these traits could apply to some business administration students, I believe they align more strongly with typical traits of computer science students and researchers. Computer science involves abstract thinking, problem-solving, and often an appreciation for the complexity of natural systems. Business tends to be more people and process-oriented. So while it's certainly possible Adam with this personality could be in either field, I estimate a higher probability of around 0.7 that he is a computer science grad student compared to a 0.3 probability for business administration.
