Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem to align well with a computer science student. The empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with either field, but seem slightly more common among computer science students in my experience. Business administration is certainly possible, but the overall profile seems to lean more towards computer science based on the limited information provided.
