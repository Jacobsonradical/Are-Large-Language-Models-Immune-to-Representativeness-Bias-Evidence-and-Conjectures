Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles. This aligns well with typical traits of someone in computer science.

The appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with business administration to some degree, but the other traits seem less directly relevant to that field compared to computer science. So I estimate a lower but still substantial probability for business administration.

These are subjective estimates based on the limited information provided. More details about Adam's specific interests, skills and background would allow for a more definitive assessment. The probabilities also don't necessarily add to 1 since the fields are not mutually exclusive and exhaustive possibilities given the sketch.
