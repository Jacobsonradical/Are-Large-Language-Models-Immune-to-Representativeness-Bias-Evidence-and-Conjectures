Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with someone likely to study computer science rather than business administration. However, the strong work ethic and dedication could apply to either field. Overall, I estimate a higher probability that this sketch describes a computer science graduate student compared to a business administration student, but both are plausible to some degree based on the limited information provided.
