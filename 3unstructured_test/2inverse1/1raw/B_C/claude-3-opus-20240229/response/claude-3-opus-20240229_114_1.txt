Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the limited information provided:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align more strongly with computer science, so I assigned a higher probability there. Business administration is certainly possible, but I felt the traits mentioned fit somewhat less well with that field, so I gave it a lower probability. However, these are very rough estimates based on limited information and stereotypes. Much more would be needed to make a confident determination.
