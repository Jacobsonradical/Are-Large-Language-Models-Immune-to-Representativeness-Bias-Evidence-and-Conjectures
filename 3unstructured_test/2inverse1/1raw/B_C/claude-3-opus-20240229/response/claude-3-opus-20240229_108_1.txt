Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch mentions traits like curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. These align more strongly with a computer science background than business administration. However, the sketch also mentions empathy, a warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could fit with either field. Overall, I estimate a higher probability that Adam was studying computer science based on the given personality description.
