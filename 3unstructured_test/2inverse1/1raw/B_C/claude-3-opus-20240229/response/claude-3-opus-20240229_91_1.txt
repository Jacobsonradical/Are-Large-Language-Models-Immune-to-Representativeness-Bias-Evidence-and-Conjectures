Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his enrollment in each field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, abstract thinking, and intelligence align more closely with a computer science student than a business administration student. However, qualities like empathy, appreciation for hard work, and a love of nature and animals could apply to students in either field. So while I assess a higher probability for computer science, I wouldn't rule out business administration entirely based on the personality sketch provided.
