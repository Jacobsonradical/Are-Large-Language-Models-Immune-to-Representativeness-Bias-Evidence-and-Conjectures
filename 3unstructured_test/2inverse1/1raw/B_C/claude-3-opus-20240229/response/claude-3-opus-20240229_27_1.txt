Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an ability to understand abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to a variety of fields, they seem to align more closely with computer science than business administration. The interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts in particular suggests an aptitude for computer science and related technical fields. Business administration typically involves more interpersonal and leadership skills that were not highlighted in the personality sketch. However, the strong work ethic and dedication mentioned could be applicable to both fields. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of 0.7 that Adam was studying computer science, and a lower but still plausible probability of 0.3 that he was studying business administration.
