Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts align well with someone studying computer science. The empathy, warm-heartedness and appreciation of hard work and dedication could fit with either field, but seem slightly more common in computer science than business administration in my estimation. However, both are certainly plausible based on the limited information provided.
