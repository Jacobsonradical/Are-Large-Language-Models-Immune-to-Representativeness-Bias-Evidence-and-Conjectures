Here is my estimate in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align more with computer science than business administration. The affinity for problem solving and abstract thinking is common in computer science. However, the strong empathy and love of nature and animals could also suit certain areas of business like non-profit administration. So while I believe computer science is more probable given the sketch, I wouldn't rule out business administration entirely.
