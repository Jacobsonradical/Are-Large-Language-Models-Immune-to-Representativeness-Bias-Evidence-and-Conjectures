Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. Of course, this is just a rough estimate based on limited information. The personality traits could potentially fit either field depending on the individual.
