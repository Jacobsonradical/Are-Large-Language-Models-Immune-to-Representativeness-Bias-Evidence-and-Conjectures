Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each of the given fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy and a deep love for animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to someone in various fields, they seem to align more closely with someone in a scientific or technical field like computer science rather than business administration. The curiosity about nature, aptitude for abstract concepts and puzzle-solving point more towards computer science in my estimation. However, the traits mentioned could certainly apply to some business students as well, so I wouldn't completely rule out that possibility.
