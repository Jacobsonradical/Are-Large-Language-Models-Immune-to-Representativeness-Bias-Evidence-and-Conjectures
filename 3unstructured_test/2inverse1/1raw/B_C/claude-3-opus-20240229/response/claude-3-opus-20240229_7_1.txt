Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving. These traits seem more aligned with someone likely to pursue computer science compared to business administration. However, the qualities of empathy, dedication and hard work could lend themselves to either field. Without more specific information it's difficult to say definitively, but I believe the described personality has a somewhat higher probability of being a computer science student compared to business administration, based on the details provided.
