Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving. These traits align well with a computer science student. The empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with either field, but seem somewhat more common in computer science than business in my estimation. Business administration is certainly a possibility, but the overall profile seems to me to fit computer science a bit better, so I've assigned a higher probability to that field.
