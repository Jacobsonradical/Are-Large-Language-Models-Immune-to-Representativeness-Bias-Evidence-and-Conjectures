Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, analytical, and has a strong interest in understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles. This aligns more closely with the typical traits and interests of someone studying computer science compared to business administration.

However, the sketch also mentions empathy, dedication and hard work, which could be relevant to both fields. Business administration does deal with some abstract concepts as well. So while computer science seems more probable given the overall profile, I wouldn't rule out business administration entirely based on this limited information. More details about Adam's specific interests and goals would help narrow it down further.
