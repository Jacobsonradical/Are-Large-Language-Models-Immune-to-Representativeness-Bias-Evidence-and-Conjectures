Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, which aligns well with skills needed for computer science. The curiosity about nature and love of animals is less directly relevant but could indicate an analytical mindset.

For business administration, the empathy, dedication and hard work are very applicable skills. However, the other traits mentioned seem less directly relevant for business compared to computer science.

Of course, these are just estimates based on limited information. The individual's actual field of study would depend on many other factors beyond just this brief personality sketch.
