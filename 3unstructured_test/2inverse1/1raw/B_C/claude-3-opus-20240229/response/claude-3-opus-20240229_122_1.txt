Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits align well with a computer science student. While business administration also requires intelligence, it is less focused on abstract problem-solving compared to computer science.

The strong interest in nature, plants and animals is not as directly relevant to either field, but seems more compatible with computer science than business. The empathy and hard work ethic could apply to both.

So while it's certainly possible Adam could be in either field, the overall profile seems to fit computer science a bit better based on the emphasis on abstract thinking and problem solving. But there are definitely business students with some of these traits as well.
