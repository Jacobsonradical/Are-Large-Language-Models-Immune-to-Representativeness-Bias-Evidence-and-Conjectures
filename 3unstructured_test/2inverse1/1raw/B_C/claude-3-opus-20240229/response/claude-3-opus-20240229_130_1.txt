Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with a computer science student. The empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with either field, but seem slightly more common in computer science than business administration in my estimation. However, the personality sketch is quite general and could potentially describe a graduate student in a variety of fields.
