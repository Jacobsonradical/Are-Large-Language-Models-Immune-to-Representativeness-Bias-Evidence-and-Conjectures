Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and can understand abstract concepts well. These traits seem more aligned with a computer science student than a business administration student. However, the sketch also mentions a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could apply to both fields. Overall, I believe the probability is higher that Adam was a computer science graduate student based on the personality description provided.
