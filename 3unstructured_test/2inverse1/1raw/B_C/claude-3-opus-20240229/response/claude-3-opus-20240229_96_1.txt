Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's genuine curiosity, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a strong fit with computer science. While business administration requires intelligence and hard work as well, the specific traits of curiosity about nature, empathy, and love of animals seem less directly relevant. Of course, individuals can succeed in a variety of fields regardless of personality. But based solely on the given description, I estimate a higher probability that the sketch refers to a computer science graduate student compared to business administration.
