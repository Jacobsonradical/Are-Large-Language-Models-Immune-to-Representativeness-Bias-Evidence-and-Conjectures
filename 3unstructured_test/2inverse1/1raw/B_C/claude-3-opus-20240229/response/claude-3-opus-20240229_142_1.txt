Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity about nature, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with someone studying computer science compared to business administration. However, traits like empathy, love for animals, and appreciating hard work and dedication could apply to a variety of fields. Therefore, while I estimate a higher probability for computer science, I still assign some probability to business administration as well based on the personality description provided.
