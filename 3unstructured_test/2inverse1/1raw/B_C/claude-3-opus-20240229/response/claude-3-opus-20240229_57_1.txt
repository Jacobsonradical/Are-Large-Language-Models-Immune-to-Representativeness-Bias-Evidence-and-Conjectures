Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, assuming he was enrolled in each respective field in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with someone studying computer science compared to business administration. The empathy, love of nature and animals could apply to either field to some degree. Overall, the personality sketch feels more probable for a computer science student, but a business student having those traits is certainly possible as well.
