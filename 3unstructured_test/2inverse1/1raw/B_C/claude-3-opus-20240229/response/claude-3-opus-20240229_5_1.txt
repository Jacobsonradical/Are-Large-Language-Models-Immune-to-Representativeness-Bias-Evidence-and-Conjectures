Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch emphasizes curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, which align well with a computer science graduate student. The empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit either field to some degree, but seem more peripheral to business administration. So I estimate a higher probability that this describes a computer science graduate student compared to a business administration student, but there is some possibility it could describe either.
