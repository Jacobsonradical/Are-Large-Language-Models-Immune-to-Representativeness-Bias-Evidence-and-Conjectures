Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles and abstract concepts, has empathy and love for animals, and appreciates hard work. While these traits could apply to people in various fields, they seem to align somewhat more strongly with computer science than business administration. The curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence and abstract thinking seem particularly relevant for computer science. However, the overall sketch is quite general and could potentially describe students in a range of disciplines, so the probabilities are not extreme in either direction. The empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also apply in business. But overall, the traits seem to tilt the odds more towards computer science in my estimation.
