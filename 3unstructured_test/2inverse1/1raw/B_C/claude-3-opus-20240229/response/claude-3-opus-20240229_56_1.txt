Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a curious, analytical mind who enjoys problem-solving and can grasp abstract concepts well. This fits the profile of many computer science students. The empathy, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to a variety of fields. While business administration students certainly can have those qualities too, I think the overall description leans more towards a computer science student. Of course, this is just a rough estimate based on the limited information provided.
