Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a curious, analytical mind who enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. This aligns more closely with typical traits and interests of someone in computer science compared to business administration. The empathy, love of animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication could apply to either field. However, the overall profile seems to fit computer science a bit better, so I assigned a higher probability to that field, while still allowing a reasonable probability that it could describe a business student.
