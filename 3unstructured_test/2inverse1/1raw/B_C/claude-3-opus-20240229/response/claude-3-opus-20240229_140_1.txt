Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch mentions qualities like curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying computer science compared to business administration. However, the strong work ethic and dedication mentioned could apply to both fields. Overall, I estimate a higher probability of around 0.7 that Adam was studying computer science, and a lower but still plausible probability of around 0.3 that he was studying business administration. But there is some uncertainty since the sketch provides limited information to definitively determine his field of study.
