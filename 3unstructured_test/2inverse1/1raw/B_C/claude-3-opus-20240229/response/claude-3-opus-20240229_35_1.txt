Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious, intelligent, empathetic, and appreciates hard work and abstract concepts. These traits seem more aligned with someone studying computer science compared to business administration. Computer science involves problem solving, abstract thinking, and dedication. Business administration relies more on interpersonal skills, leadership, and practical applications.

However, the personality sketch could potentially match someone in either field. Curiosity, intelligence and work ethic are valuable in both areas of study. So while computer science seems more probable given the description, I wouldn't rule out business administration as a possibility. The probabilities reflect this - a higher likelihood of computer science but not discounting business entirely. Let me know if you would like me to explain my reasoning further!
