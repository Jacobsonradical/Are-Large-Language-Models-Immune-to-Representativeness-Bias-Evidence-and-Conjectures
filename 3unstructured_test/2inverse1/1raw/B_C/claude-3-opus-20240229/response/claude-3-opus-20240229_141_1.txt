Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, puzzle-solving, intelligence and understanding abstract concepts align well with a computer science student. The empathy, warm heart and love of animals are less directly related but not incompatible.

For a business administration student, the curiosity, intelligence and hard work appreciation fit well. However, the other traits around puzzles, abstract concepts, empathy and love of animals seem less aligned with a typical business student profile.

Of course, any individual can have a diverse set of interests and traits. But based solely on the personality sketch, I estimate a higher probability of it describing a computer science graduate student compared to a business administration student.
