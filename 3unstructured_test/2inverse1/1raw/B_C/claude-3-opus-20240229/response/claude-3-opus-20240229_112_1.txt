Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align more strongly with a computer science background. However, the empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also fit with business administration to some degree.
