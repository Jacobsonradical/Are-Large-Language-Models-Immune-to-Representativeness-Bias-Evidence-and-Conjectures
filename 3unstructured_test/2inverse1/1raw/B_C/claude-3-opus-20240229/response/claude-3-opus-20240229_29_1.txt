Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, given his graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more closely aligned with a computer science student than a business administration student. However, empathy, love of animals, and appreciating hard work and dedication could apply to either field. Given the limited information, these are rough estimates with considerable uncertainty.
