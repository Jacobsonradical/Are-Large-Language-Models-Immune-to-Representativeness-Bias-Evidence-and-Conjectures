Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, intelligent, and empathetic. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align more strongly with computer science than business administration. Computer science involves abstract problem solving, logic, and often a curiosity about natural systems. Business administration tends to be more people and process-oriented. However, the sketch is quite general so both fields are plausible, hence the 0.3 probability for business. The probabilities don't need to add to 1 since they are independent estimates, not a distribution across only these two options.
