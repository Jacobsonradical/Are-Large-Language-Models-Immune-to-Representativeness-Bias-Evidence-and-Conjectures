Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on his enrollment in each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align more closely with computer science than business administration. Computer science often involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and a deep curiosity to understand complex systems. Business administration tends to be more people and process-oriented.

However, the sketch provides limited information to draw a definitive conclusion. Empathy, dedication and a love of animals could certainly apply to someone in business administration as well. My probability estimates reflect the limited information, with computer science being more likely but business administration also being a reasonable possibility based on the personality description provided.
