Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his enrollment in each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong curiosity about nature, a love of animals, and an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem particularly well-suited for computer science. Computer science involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and often draws people with intellectual curiosity. So I estimate a fairly high 70% probability the sketch could describe a computer science graduate student.

The traits seem less strongly correlated with business administration, which tends to attract people who are ambitious, outgoing, and leadership-oriented. Certainly business students can be empathetic animal lovers as well, but the overall profile seems to fit that field less closely. So I estimate only a 40% chance the sketch describes a typical MBA student.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on the limited information provided. The personality sketch could potentially describe students in a wide variety of fields.
