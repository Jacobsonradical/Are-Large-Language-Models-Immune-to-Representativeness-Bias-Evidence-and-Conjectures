Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy and love for animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to individuals in various fields, they seem to align more closely with someone studying computer science compared to business administration.

Computer science often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving, have strong analytical skills, and are capable of grasping abstract concepts. The mention of puzzle-solving and high intelligence suggests a good fit for this field.

While business administration requires intelligence and dedication, the emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy seems less directly relevant to typical business studies. However, the appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to both fields.

Please note that these probabilities are rough estimates based on the limited information provided in the personality sketch, and individuals with diverse traits and interests can be found in any field of study.
