Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam, based on the given fields of study:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is highly intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits align well with a computer science student. The curiosity about nature and plants, as well as the love for animals, could also fit with certain subfields of computer science such as artificial life simulations or biologically-inspired algorithms.

Business administration is certainly a possibility given the mention of understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication. However, the other traits mentioned seem to fit more closely with a technical or scientific field like computer science.

Of course, these are just probabilistic estimates based on limited information. The individual's actual field of study could be something else entirely.
