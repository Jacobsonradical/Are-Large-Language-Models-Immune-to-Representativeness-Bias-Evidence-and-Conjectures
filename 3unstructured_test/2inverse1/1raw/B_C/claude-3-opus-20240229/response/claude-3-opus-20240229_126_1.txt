Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles and abstract concepts, has high intelligence, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align more closely with computer science than business administration. Problem-solving, working with abstractions, and applying dedication are often associated with success in computer science. The affinity for nature is less directly relevant but could tie into an appreciation for biological systems and algorithms. Business administration is certainly a possibility but the overall profile seems to fit computer science a bit better based on the limited information provided. Of course, additional details about Adam's specific interests and goals would help refine the estimate further.
