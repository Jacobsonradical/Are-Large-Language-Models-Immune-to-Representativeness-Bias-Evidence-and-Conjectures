Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles and abstract concepts, has empathy and loves animals. This fits more closely with someone in a field like computer science rather than business administration. Problem-solving skills, curiosity, and the ability to grasp abstractions are important in computer science. However, qualities like dedication and hard work are valued in both fields. Without more specific information, it's impossible to say definitively, but based on the personality profile, I estimate a higher probability of around 0.7 that Adam was in computer science and a lower probability around 0.3 that he was in business administration as a graduate student.
