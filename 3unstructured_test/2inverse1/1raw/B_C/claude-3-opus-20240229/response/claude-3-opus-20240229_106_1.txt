Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, given his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with a computer science student than a business administration student. However, empathy, a warm heart and dedication could apply to both fields. Given the limited information, these are rough estimates with considerable uncertainty.
