Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with someone studying computer science compared to business administration. However, empathy, a warm heart, and dedication could apply to either field. The strong connection with nature and love of animals doesn't necessarily correlate strongly with either field. So while the traits seem to fit computer science a bit better overall, they don't rule out business administration by any means. Hence the 0.7 and 0.4 probability estimates respectively.
