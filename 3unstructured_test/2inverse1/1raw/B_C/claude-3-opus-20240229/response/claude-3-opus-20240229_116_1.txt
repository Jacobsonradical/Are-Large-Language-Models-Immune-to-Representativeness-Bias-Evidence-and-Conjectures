Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving, and highly intelligent. These traits align well with a computer science student. While business administration students can certainly have these qualities too, they seem more characteristic of someone in a STEM field like computer science. The strong empathy and love of animals feels less predictive of field of study. So while it's certainly possible Adam was a business student, I think the details point to a higher probability of him being in computer science.
