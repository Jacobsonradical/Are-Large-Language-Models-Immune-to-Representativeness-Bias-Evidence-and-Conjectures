Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his enrollment in each of the given fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, abstract thinking, and problem-solving. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. Computer science often involves abstract thinking, problem-solving, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. Business administration is a broader field that may or may not involve these specific traits. So while it's certainly possible Adam could be studying business, I think the chances are higher that the personality sketch describes a computer science student.
