Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious, intelligent, good at abstract thinking and problem-solving, which aligns well with typical traits of computer science students. The empathy, love of animals and nature appreciation are less directly related but not incompatible.

For business administration, the intelligence, hard work and dedication are relevant traits. However, the other aspects like curiosity about nature, love of animals, and enjoyment of puzzle-solving seem less aligned with typical business student profiles. The overall fit seems lower than for computer science.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on general field stereotypes. Any individual can have a wide range of interests and personality traits that may not match the average for their chosen area of study. More specific information about Adam's background and motivations would be needed for a confident assessment.
