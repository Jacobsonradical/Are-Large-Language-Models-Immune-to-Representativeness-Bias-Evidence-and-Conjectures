Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his enrollment in each field:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, abstract concepts, and dedication. While these traits could apply to someone in business administration, they seem to align more closely with someone in a scientific field like computer science. The curiosity, intelligence, and affinity for solving puzzles mentioned are also qualities that would serve someone well in computer science. So while it's certainly possible Adam with this personality could be in business administration, I believe the probability is higher that he is in computer science.
