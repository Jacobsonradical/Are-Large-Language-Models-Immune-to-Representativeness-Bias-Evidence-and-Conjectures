Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the limited information provided:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. However, empathy, dedication and hard work are valuable in both fields. Without more specifics about Adam's interests and strengths, this is my best estimate of the relative probabilities, but there is considerable uncertainty.
