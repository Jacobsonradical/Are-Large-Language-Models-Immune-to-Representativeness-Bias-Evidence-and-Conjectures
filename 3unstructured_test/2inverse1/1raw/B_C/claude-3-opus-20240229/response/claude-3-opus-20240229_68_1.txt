Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, for each of the two fields of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with curiosity about nature, a love of animals, and an ability to understand abstract concepts. This fits fairly well with a computer science student, as computer science involves abstract thinking and problem solving. The curiosity about nature and love of animals is less directly relevant but still compatible.

Business administration is more focused on practical applications in the business world. While the intelligence, hard work and dedication mentioned could apply to business students, the other traits around nature, animals, and abstract thinking seem less aligned with typical business administration studies.

So while it's certainly possible Adam could be studying business, I estimate a higher probability of around 0.7 that the personality sketch describes a computer science student like Adam, and a lower 0.3 probability that it describes a business administration student. But there is uncertainty in both estimates given the limited information provided.
