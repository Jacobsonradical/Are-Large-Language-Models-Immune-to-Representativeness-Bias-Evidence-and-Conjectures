Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align more strongly with a computer science student compared to a business administration student. However, traits like empathy, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication could apply to either field. Overall, I estimate a higher probability that this sketch describes a computer science grad student versus a business grad student, but both are plausible to some degree based on the limited information provided.
