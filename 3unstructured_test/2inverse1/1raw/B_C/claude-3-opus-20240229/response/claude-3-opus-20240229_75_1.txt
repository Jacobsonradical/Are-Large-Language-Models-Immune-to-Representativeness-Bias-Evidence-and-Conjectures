Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, strong problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. However, the empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also suit business administration to some degree.
