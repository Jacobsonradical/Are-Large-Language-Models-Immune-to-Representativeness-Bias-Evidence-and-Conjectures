Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, love of animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts seem more aligned with a field like computer science than business administration. However, the sketch also mentions an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could apply to both fields. Overall though, I believe the personality traits described fit better with computer science, so I assigned a higher probability to that field.
