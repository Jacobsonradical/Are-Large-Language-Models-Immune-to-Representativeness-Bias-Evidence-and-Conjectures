Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is curious, intelligent, empathetic, and appreciates hard work and dedication. While these traits could apply to many fields, they seem to align more strongly with computer science than business administration.

The subject's curiosity about nature and plants, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts point towards an analytical and inquisitive mind, which is often found in computer science and related STEM fields. The empathy and love for animals are less directly relevant but show a well-rounded personality.

Business administration relies more on interpersonal skills, leadership, and practical applications rather than abstract concepts. The personality sketch doesn't highlight traits like being outgoing, assertive, or having a strong interest in finance and management.

So while the sketch doesn't rule out business administration, I believe the probability is higher that Adam studied computer science based on the highlighted traits and interests. The probabilities I provided are my best estimates given the limited information available.
