Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone with a strong interest in nature, animals, abstract concepts, and problem-solving. While these traits could apply to a variety of fields, they seem to align more closely with computer science than business administration. Computer science often involves abstract thinking, problem-solving, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. Business administration is more focused on management, finance, and organizational skills which were not highlighted in the personality sketch. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to say definitively, so I have assigned a 30% probability to business administration to account for the possibility. The probabilities are estimates based on the limited information provided.
