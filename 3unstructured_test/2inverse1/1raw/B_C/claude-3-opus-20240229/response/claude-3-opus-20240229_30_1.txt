Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at abstract thinking and problem solving. This fits the profile of many computer science students. While business students can certainly have these traits as well, they are more stereotypically associated with STEM fields like computer science. The subject's strong empathy and love of animals doesn't necessarily align with common stereotypes of either field. Overall, I believe the personality is more likely to describe a computer science student than a business student, but it could apply to either. Hence my probability estimates of 0.6 for computer science and 0.3 for business administration.
