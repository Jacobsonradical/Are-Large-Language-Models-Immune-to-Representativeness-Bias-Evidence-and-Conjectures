Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch mentions a curiosity about nature and plants, as well as a love for animals, which seems more aligned with fields like biology or environmental science than computer science or business. However, it also mentions intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which could apply to many fields including computer science and business.

I gave a somewhat higher probability to computer science since it involves more abstract concepts and problem-solving skills like enjoying puzzles. Business requires intelligence and hard work as well, but may be slightly less focused on abstract concepts. However, both are plausible fields given the personality description. The probabilities are rough estimates based on limited information.
