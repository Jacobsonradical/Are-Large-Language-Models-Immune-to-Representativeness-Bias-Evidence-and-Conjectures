Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

The personality sketch suggests someone who is intelligent, curious about nature and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy. This fits well with a computer science student, as computer science requires strong analytical and problem-solving skills, deals with abstract concepts, and attracts those with intellectual curiosity. 

The personality traits are less directly relevant to business administration, which is more focused on leadership, management, finance and operations. Some aspects like dedication and hard work would apply, but overall the sketch seems to fit computer science significantly better. Business administration is certainly possible but I judge it to be less likely given the details provided.
