Here is my estimate for the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, based on his field of graduate study in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence and understanding abstract concepts seem more aligned with someone studying computer science compared to business administration. However, empathy, dedication and hard work are valuable traits for both fields. Without more specifics it's difficult to say definitively, but based on the limited information provided, I estimate a higher probability that Adam was a computer science graduate student compared to business administration.
