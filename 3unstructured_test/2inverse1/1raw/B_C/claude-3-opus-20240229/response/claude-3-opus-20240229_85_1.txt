Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch is about Adam for each of the given fields of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The personality sketch indicates a person who is intelligent, curious about nature, good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. These traits align well with someone studying computer science.

While the sketch also mentions empathy, a warm heart and dedication which could fit with business administration, overall the profile seems to more strongly match a computer science student, so I estimate a higher probability for that field.
