Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch describes Adam, for each of the given fields of study:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have traits and interests that align more strongly with computer science, such as curiosity about nature, enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. While some of the traits like dedication and hard work could apply to business administration as well, overall the profile seems to fit better with a computer science student. However, there is still a reasonable probability he could be studying business administration.
