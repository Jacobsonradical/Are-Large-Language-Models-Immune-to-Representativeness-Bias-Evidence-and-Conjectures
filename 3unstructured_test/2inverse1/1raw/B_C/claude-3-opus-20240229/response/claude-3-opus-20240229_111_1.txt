Here is my estimate of the probabilities for each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles and abstract concepts, and has strong empathy. These traits seem more aligned with computer science than business administration. problem-solving, abstract thinking and curiosity are important in computer science.

However, the sketch also mentions appreciating hard work and dedication, which could fit with business administration. And of course, people of various personalities can be found in any field. So while I think computer science is more probable given the description, I wouldn't rule out business administration entirely.
