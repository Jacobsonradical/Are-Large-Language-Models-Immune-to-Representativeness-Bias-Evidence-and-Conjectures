Here is my estimate of the probability that the personality sketch was about Adam for each field, based on the given information:

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch describes someone who is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy and a love for animals, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. While these traits could apply to someone in either field, they seem to align more closely with computer science. Problem-solving skills, an ability to grasp abstractions, and curiosity are all valuable in computer science.

Business administration also requires intelligence and dedication, so the personality sketch is not incompatible with that field. However, the specific mentions of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and abstract thinking suggest a somewhat higher probability of computer science in my estimation. Of course, there is still uncertainty without more information about Adam's specific interests and aptitudes.
