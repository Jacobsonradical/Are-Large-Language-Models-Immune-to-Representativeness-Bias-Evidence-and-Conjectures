Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity, high intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align more closely with the problem-solving and analytical nature of computer science.
- The strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to both fields, but the emphasis on empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature and plants might suggest a slightly lower fit for business administration, which typically focuses more on management, finance, and organizational behavior.
