Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The subject's traits such as empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence could be relevant to business administration, but the focus on nature, plants, and animals, as well as the enjoyment of solving puzzles, suggests a stronger inclination towards fields that involve problem-solving and analytical thinking.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's curiosity, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests typically found in computer science. The strong empathy and love for animals might not directly relate to computer science but do not contradict it either.
