Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's strong empathy, appreciation for hard work, and high intelligence could be applicable to both fields, but the genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles might lean more towards fields that involve problem-solving and analytical thinking, such as computer science.
- The mention of understanding abstract concepts also aligns well with computer science.
- While business administration can also involve problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, the specific interests mentioned in the sketch (nature, plants, animals) are less directly related to typical business administration studies.
