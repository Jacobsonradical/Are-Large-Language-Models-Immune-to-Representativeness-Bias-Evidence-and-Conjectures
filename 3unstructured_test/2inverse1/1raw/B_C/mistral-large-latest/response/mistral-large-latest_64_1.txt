Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills and interests common in computer science. Additionally, a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals could be seen as traits of someone who might be interested in computational biology or environmental informatics, which are subfields of computer science.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in any field, including business administration, the other traits mentioned (curiosity about nature, love for animals, enjoyment of puzzles, and high intelligence in abstract concepts) are less directly aligned with typical interests and skills in business administration. Therefore, the probability is lower for this field.
