Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a leaning towards fields that might involve environmental or biological sciences, which are not directly related to business administration.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the analytical and problem-solving skills required in computer science.
- The mention of a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication is a trait that could be valuable in both fields, but the other characteristics lean more towards computer science.
