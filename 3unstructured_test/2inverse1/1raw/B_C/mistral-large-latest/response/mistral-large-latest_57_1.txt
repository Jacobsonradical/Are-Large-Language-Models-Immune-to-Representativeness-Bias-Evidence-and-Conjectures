Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as their high intelligence, could apply to both fields.
- However, their genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and enjoyment of solving puzzles lean more towards fields that involve problem-solving, abstract thinking, and potentially environmental or scientific aspects.
- Computer science often involves solving complex puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which aligns well with the subject's interests and skills.
- Business administration, while it can involve problem-solving, is less directly related to the subject's curiosity about nature and love for animals.
