Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a leaning towards fields that might involve environmental or biological sciences, which are not directly listed but could be more aligned with these interests.
- The mention of high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could indicate a good fit for computer science.
- The appreciation for hard work and dedication is a trait that could be beneficial in both business administration and computer science, but the specific interests in nature and animals might make business administration less likely.
- Therefore, computer science seems more probable given the emphasis on problem-solving and abstract thinking.
