Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity, high intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align more closely with the problem-solving and analytical nature of computer science.
- The emphasis on empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be found in either field, but these traits are not as strongly indicative of business administration as they might be for other fields.
- The quiet and puzzle-solving nature of the subject also leans more towards computer science.
