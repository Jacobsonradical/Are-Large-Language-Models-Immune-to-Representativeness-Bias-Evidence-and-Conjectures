Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest interests that are not typically associated with business administration, hence the lower probability.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills and interests common in computer science, hence the higher probability.
