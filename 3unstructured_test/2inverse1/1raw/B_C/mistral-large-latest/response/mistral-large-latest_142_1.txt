Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a leaning towards fields that might involve environmental or biological sciences, which are not directly mentioned but could be inferred as interests.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with computer science.
- The subject's understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to both fields but might be more directly applicable to the rigorous and often abstract nature of computer science.
- Business administration is less directly aligned with the specific interests and traits mentioned in the sketch, hence the lower probability.
