Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication might suggest a leaning towards fields that involve problem-solving and abstract concepts, which are more commonly associated with computer science.
- While business administration can also involve problem-solving and abstract thinking, the emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy seems to align more closely with fields that might involve scientific inquiry or environmental concerns, which are less typical in business administration.
