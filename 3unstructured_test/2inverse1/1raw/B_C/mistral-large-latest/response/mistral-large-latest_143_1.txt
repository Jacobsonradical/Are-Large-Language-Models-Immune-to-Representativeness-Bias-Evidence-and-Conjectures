Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a leaning towards fields that might involve environmental or biological sciences, which are not directly listed but could be inferred as less likely to be business administration.
- The subject's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science.
- The appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to both fields but is more commonly associated with the rigorous problem-solving nature of computer science.

Thus, the probability is higher for computer science compared to business administration.
