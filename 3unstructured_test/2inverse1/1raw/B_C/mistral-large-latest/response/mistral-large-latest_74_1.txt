Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals might suggest a leaning towards fields that involve environmental or biological sciences, which are not directly related to business administration or computer science.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align more closely with the analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science.
- While business administration can involve understanding abstract concepts and hard work, the emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy seems less directly applicable to this field.

Therefore, the probability is higher for computer science compared to business administration.
