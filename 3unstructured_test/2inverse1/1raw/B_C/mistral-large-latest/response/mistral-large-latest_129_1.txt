  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy seem more aligned with fields that emphasize creativity, problem-solving, and understanding complex systems (like computer science) rather than business administration.
- The mention of high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts also leans more towards computer science.
- However, the appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to both fields, hence a non-zero probability for business administration.
