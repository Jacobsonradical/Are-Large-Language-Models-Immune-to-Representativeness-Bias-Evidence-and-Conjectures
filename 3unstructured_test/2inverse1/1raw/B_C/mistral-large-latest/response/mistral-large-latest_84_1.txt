Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: The subject's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests common in computer science. Hence, a higher probability is assigned.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be relevant, the focus on nature, plants, and animals, as well as the enjoyment of puzzles, seems less directly aligned with typical interests in business administration. Hence, a lower probability is assigned.
