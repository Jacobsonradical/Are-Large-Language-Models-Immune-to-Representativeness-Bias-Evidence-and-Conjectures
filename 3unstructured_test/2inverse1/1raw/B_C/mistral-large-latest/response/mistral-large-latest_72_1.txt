Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: The subject's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests typically found in computer science students.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be beneficial in business, the focus on nature, plants, and animals, as well as the interest in puzzles and abstract concepts, seems less aligned with typical business administration interests.
