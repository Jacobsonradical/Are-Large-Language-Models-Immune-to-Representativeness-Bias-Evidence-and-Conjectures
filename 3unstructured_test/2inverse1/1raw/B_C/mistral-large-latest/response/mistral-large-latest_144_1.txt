Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a personality that might be more inclined towards fields that involve understanding complex systems, problem-solving, and possibly environmental or biological sciences.
- The mention of high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science, which often involves solving puzzles and dealing with abstract concepts.
- While business administration can also involve problem-solving and abstract thinking, the emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy seems less directly related to typical business administration curricula.

Therefore, the probability is higher for computer science compared to business administration.
