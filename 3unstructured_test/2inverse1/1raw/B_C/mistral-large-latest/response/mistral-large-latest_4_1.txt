Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a personality that might be more drawn to fields that involve understanding and caring for living things, which is less typical of business administration.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science.
- The appreciation for hard work and dedication is a trait that could be beneficial in both fields, but the specific interests and skills mentioned lean more towards computer science.
