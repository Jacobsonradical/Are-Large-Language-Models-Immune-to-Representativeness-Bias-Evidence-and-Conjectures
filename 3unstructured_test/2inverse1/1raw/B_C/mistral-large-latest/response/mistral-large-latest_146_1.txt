  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy seem to align more with fields that involve problem-solving and understanding complex systems (like computer science) rather than business administration.
- The mention of high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication also lean more towards computer science, although these traits could be valuable in business administration as well.
- The subject's quiet nature and interest in puzzles might be more indicative of someone who enjoys the logical and often solitary work involved in computer science. However, there is still a possibility that the subject could be interested in business administration, hence the non-zero probability.
