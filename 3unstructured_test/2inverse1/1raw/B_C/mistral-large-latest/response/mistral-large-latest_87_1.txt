Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a leaning towards fields that might involve environmental or biological sciences, which are not directly related to business administration.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are traits that align well with computer science.
- While business administration can involve problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, the emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy makes computer science a more likely fit.
