}

Explanation:
- The subject's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align well with the skills and interests common in computer science, hence the higher probability.
- While it's possible for the subject to be in business administration, the personality sketch does not highlight traits typically associated with this field, such as leadership, extraversion, or a strong focus on management or finance. Therefore, the probability is lower.
