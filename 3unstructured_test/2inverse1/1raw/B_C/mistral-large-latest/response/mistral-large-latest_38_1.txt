Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a leaning towards fields that might involve problem-solving, creativity, and potentially environmental or biological sciences.
- High intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts are traits that are beneficial in both business administration and computer science.
- The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns well with the problem-solving nature of computer science.
- While business administration also requires problem-solving skills, the emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy might be less directly applicable in this field compared to computer science.

Therefore, the probability is higher for computer science.
