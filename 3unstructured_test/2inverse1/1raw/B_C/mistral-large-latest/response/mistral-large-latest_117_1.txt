Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The sketch mentions traits like empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence, which could be applicable to business administration. However, the focus on nature, plants, puzzles, and abstract concepts seems less directly related to this field.
- **Computer Science**: The mention of solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence aligns well with the skills and interests often found in computer science. Additionally, the quiet and analytical nature described fits well with the stereotypical profile of a computer science student.
