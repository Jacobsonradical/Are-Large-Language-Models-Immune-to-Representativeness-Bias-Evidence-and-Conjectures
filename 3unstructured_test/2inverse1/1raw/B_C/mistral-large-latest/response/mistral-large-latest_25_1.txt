Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: The subject's traits, such as empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence, could be relevant to business administration. However, the strong focus on nature, plants, and animals, as well as the interest in solving puzzles, suggests a more analytical and scientific inclination.
- **Computer Science**: The subject's curiosity, intelligence, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science. The strong empathy and love for animals might not be directly related to computer science but do not contradict it either.
