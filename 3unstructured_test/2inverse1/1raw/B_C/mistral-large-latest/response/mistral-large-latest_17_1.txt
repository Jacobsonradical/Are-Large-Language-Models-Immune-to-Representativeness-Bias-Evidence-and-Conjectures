Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as high intelligence, could fit well in a business administration program. However, the focus on nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles suggests a stronger alignment with fields that involve problem-solving and analytical thinking.
- Computer science is more aligned with the subject's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are common traits in computer science students. The focus on nature and animals might also relate to interests in environmental or biological data analysis, which are areas where computer science can be applied.
