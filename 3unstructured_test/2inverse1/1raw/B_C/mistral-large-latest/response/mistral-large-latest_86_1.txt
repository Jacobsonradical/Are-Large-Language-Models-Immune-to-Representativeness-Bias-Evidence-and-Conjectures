Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a leaning towards fields that might involve problem-solving, abstract thinking, and possibly environmental or biological sciences.
- The mention of high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science, which often involves solving complex puzzles and dealing with abstract concepts.
- Business administration, while it can involve problem-solving and abstract thinking, is less directly aligned with the subject's interests in nature and animals.

Therefore, the probability is higher for computer science compared to business administration.
