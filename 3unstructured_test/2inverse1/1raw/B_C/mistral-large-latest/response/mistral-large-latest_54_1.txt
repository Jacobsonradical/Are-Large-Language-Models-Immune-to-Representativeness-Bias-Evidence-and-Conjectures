Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with traits commonly found in computer science students. Additionally, the subject's genuine curiosity and strong empathy could be channeled into innovative and ethical technological solutions.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject's intelligence and understanding of hard work and dedication could be beneficial in business administration, the emphasis on a love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles seems less directly aligned with typical business administration traits. Therefore, the probability is lower but not zero.
