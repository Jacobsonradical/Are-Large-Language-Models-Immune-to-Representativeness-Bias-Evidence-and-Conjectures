Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a personality that might be more inclined towards fields that involve problem-solving, creativity, and possibly environmental or biological sciences.
- The mention of high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts aligns well with computer science, which often involves solving puzzles and dealing with abstract concepts.
- While business administration can also involve problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, the emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy seems to fit less with the typical profile of a business administration student.
