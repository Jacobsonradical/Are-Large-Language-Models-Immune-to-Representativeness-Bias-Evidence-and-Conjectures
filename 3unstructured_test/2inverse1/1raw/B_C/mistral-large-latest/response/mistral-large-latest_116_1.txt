Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a leaning towards fields that might involve environmental or biological sciences, which are not directly mentioned but could be inferred as interests.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with computer science, making it more likely that Adam would be enrolled in this field.
- While business administration is a possibility, the traits described in the sketch seem to align more closely with fields that involve problem-solving, abstract thinking, and a connection to nature or animals, hence the lower probability for business administration.
