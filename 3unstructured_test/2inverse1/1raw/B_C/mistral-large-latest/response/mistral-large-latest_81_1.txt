Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The sketch mentions a genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, which might not typically align with the stereotypical traits of someone in business administration. However, high intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts could be relevant in both fields.
- The mention of solving puzzles and high intelligence might lean more towards computer science, where problem-solving and abstract thinking are highly valued.

Thus, the probabilities are weighted more towards computer science.
