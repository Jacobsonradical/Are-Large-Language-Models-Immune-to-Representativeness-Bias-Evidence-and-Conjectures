Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication do not strongly correlate with business administration. While high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts can be useful in business, the other traits suggest a stronger inclination towards fields that involve problem-solving and a connection to nature or animals.
- The subject's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are more aligned with computer science. The focus on problem-solving and abstract thinking in computer science makes it a more likely field for the subject described in the sketch.
