}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy might lean more towards fields that involve environmental or social aspects, which are less common in business administration. However, their understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to any field, hence a probability of 0.3.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align more closely with the problem-solving and analytical skills required in computer science, hence a probability of 0.6.
