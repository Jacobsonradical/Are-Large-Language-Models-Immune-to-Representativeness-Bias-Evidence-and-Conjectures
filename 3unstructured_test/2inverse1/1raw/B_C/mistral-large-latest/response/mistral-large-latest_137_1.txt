Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as their high intelligence, could apply to both fields.
- However, their genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles lean more towards the problem-solving and innovative aspects often found in computer science.
- The emphasis on empathy and understanding abstract concepts also aligns more closely with the logical and creative thinking required in computer science.
- While business administration can involve problem-solving and empathy, it is less directly related to the subject's interests in nature and animals.
