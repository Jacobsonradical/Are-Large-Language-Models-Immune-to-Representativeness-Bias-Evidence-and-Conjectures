Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest a more scientific or humanities-oriented mindset, which aligns better with fields like computer science rather than business administration.
- The subject's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are valuable in both fields but are particularly crucial in computer science.
- The quiet nature and enjoyment of solving puzzles also lean more towards computer science, where problem-solving and analytical thinking are key.
