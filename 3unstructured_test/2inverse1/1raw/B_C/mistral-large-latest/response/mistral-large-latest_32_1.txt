Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity, high intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align more closely with fields like computer science, which often involve problem-solving and abstract thinking.
- The strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to both fields, but the emphasis on solving puzzles and a deep love for animals and nature might suggest a stronger inclination towards fields that involve analytical and logical thinking, such as computer science.
- Business administration, while requiring intelligence and hard work, may not align as closely with the subject's interests in nature, animals, and puzzle-solving.
