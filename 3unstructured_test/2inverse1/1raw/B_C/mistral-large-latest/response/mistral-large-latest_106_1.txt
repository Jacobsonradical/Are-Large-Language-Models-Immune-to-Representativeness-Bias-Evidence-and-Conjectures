Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science**: The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with traits commonly found in computer science students.
- **Business Administration**: While the subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant, the focus on nature, plants, animals, and puzzle-solving suggests a lower probability of being in business administration compared to computer science.
