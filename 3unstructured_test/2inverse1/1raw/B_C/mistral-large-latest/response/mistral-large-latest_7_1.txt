Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: While Adam's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles do not strongly align with typical traits associated with business administration. Hence, a lower probability of 0.3.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are traits that are well-suited to computer science. Additionally, his empathy and warm heart could be beneficial in collaborative environments often found in tech fields. Hence, a higher probability of 0.7.
