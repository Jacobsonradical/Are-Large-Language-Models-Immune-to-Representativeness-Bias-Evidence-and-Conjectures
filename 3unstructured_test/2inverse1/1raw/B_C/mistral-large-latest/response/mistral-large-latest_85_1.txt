Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a personality that might be more inclined towards fields that involve understanding complex systems, problem-solving, and possibly environmental or biological sciences.
- The mention of high intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts aligns well with fields like computer science, which often require strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
- While business administration also requires intelligence and problem-solving, the sketch's emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy seems less directly aligned with typical business administration interests.

Therefore, the probability is higher for computer science compared to business administration.
