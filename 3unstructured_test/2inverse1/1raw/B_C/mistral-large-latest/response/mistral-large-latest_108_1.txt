Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: While Adam's traits such as high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles seem less directly aligned with typical business administration interests.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are strongly aligned with skills and interests common in computer science. His empathy and love for nature and animals could also be reflected in his choice of projects or specializations within the field.
