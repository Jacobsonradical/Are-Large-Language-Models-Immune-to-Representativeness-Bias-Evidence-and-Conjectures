  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

Explanation:
- The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy seem more aligned with fields that involve problem-solving, understanding complex systems, and potentially environmental or biological sciences, rather than business administration.
- The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest a good fit for computer science, which often involves solving complex problems and working with abstract concepts.
- While the subject could still be in business administration, the personality traits described seem less typical of this field, hence the lower probability.
