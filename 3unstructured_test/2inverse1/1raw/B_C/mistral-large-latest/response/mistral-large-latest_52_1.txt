Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities that the sketch was about Adam in each of the following fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, as well as high intelligence, could apply to both fields, but these traits are not specifically indicative of business administration.
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles lean more towards fields that involve problem-solving and analytical thinking, which are more characteristic of computer science.
- The mention of understanding abstract concepts also aligns well with computer science, which often involves dealing with abstract concepts and theories.

Therefore, the probability is higher for computer science.
