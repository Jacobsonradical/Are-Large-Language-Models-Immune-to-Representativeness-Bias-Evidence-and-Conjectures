Explanation:
Given that Adam has a strong intellectual ability, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts, it is more likely that he would excel and be interested in a technical field like computer science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication, along with a love for animals and nature, suggests less alignment with business administration, though not entirely ruling it out. Therefore, the probability for computer science is higher.
