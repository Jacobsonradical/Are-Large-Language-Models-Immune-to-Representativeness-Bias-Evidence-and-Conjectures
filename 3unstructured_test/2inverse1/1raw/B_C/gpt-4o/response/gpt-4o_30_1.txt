Explanation: Adam's traits such as high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts align well with the field of computer science, which often requires strong problem-solving skills and the ability to grasp intricate, abstract ideas. His curiosity about nature and warm heart may suggest he might be less inclined towards a field focused on business administration, which typically emphasizes leadership, management strategies, and finance. Therefore, there is a higher probability that the personality sketch fits someone in computer science over business administration.
