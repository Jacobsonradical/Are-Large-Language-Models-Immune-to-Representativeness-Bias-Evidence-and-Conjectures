Explanation: The personality sketch describes someone with a strong intelligence, appreciation for hard work, curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, and a deep love for animals. These attributes are more commonly associated with fields that require analytical thinking and a deep understanding of abstract concepts, such as computer science. This is why the probability for computer science is higher. Business administration can also benefit from those traits, but it is less directly associated with the described interest in nature and solving puzzles, leading to a lower probability.
