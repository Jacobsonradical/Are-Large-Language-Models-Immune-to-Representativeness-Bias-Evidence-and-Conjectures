Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

Explanation:
- The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are more closely aligned with the traits often found in someone studying computer science.
- The warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication might fit in a variety of fields, but business administration seems a bit less likely given the subject's deep love for animals and nature, which are not typically central to that field of study.
