Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, and high intelligence with a focus on abstract concepts, he seems more likely to be enrolled in a field that involves problem-solving and analytical thinking, such as computer science. His interest in puzzles and deep empathy could allow him to innovate and address real-world problems efficiently within computer science. However, his empathy and understanding of hard work could also apply to business administration, where interpersonal skills and dedication are important, but it appears to be a less strong fit compared to computer science.
