Based on the given personality sketch and considering the characteristics associated with different fields of study, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: While Adam's empathy, understanding of dedication, and intelligence could be assets in business administration, the provided sketch does not strongly align with typical business interests such as leadership, economics, and management. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and solving puzzles do not strongly correlate with this field. Hence, a lower probability.

- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence, proficiency in understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are strong indicators of success in computer science. The field often involves complex problem-solving and abstract thinking, making it a more fitting match for his personality traits. Hence, a higher probability.
