Explanation: 

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in a field that requires problem-solving and logical thinking. Computer science fits this description well. The emphasis on understanding abstract concepts also aligns well with the kind of skills needed in computer science.

While business administration also requires intelligence and understanding of concepts, it typically does not focus as intensely on solving puzzles or understanding nature and its elements in the way computer science might. Therefore, the probability for business administration is lower.
