Explanation:
- Given Adam's described interests in nature, solving puzzles, and love for animals, it's less likely that he is pursuing a degree in business administration, which typically involves more focus on leadership, management, and business operations.
- On the other hand, given his high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, it's more likely he might be enrolled in computer science, which often involves abstract thinking, logical problem-solving, and could align with his intellectual and curiosity-driven profile.
