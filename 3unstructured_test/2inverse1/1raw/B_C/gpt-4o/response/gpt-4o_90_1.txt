Given the personality sketch, here are the estimated probabilities that it pertains to Adam if he was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These estimates assume that the qualities described—such as high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and a fondness for puzzles—are more commonly aligned with fields like computer science. While empathy and appreciation for hard work can exist in any field, the sketch does not strongly suggest business administration, leading to a lower probability for that field.
