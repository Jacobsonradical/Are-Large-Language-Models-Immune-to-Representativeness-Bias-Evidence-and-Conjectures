Based on the personality sketch provided and the characteristics of the fields mentioned, here are the estimated probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.8
}

The personality traits described, such as curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, align more closely with the typical interests and skills associated with computer science. The strong empathy and deep love for animals might be less directly aligned with business administration, which could suggest a lower probability for that field.
