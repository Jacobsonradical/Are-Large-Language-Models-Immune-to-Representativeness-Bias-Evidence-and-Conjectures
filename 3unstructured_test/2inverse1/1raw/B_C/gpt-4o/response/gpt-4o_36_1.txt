Explanation:
The personality sketch describes someone with a high level of intelligence, an interest in solving puzzles, and a deep curiosity about nature, abstract concepts, and animals. This profile fits well with a computer science student, as this field often requires strong problem-solving skills, an ability to understand abstract concepts, and intellectual curiosity. While it is possible for someone with these traits to be in business administration, the personality traits described align more closely with typical characteristics of someone in computer science.
