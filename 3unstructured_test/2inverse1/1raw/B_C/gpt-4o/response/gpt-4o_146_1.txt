{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

**Rationales:**

- **Computer Science (0.7):** The traits of being highly intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles are strongly indicative of a personality suited to computer science. Additionally, a genuine curiosity about nature and problem-solving aligns well with many aspects of computer science.

- **Business Administration (0.3):** While strong empathy and a warm heart can be beneficial in business administration, the deep love for animals and nature, along with a keen interest in solving puzzles, are less directly aligned with the field of business administration. The appreciation for hard work and dedication is valuable in any field but does not strongly point towards business administration over other options.
